<seg id="1">Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the extracellular surface (cell membrane) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">By reducing the content of angiotensin II and increasing the content of Ang (1-7) to inhibit the activity of related angiotensin-converting Enzyme (ACE), ACE2 is expected to become a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point for some coronaviruses into cells.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of this enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein contains a N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal Collectrin kidney amino acid transporter domain.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein whose enzyme-active domain is exposed to the cell surface of the lungs and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another enzyme, known as sheddase, cracks the extracellular domain of ACE2 from the transmembrane domain, producing soluble proteins that are released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane, mainly type II alveolar cells in the lungs, intestinal epithelial cells in the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells in most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="9">ACE2 mRNA expression has also been found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main function of ACE2 is to counterbalance ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE cracks angiotensin I into angiotensin II with vasoconstriction activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2 then cracks the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin with vasodilation activity (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also crack many other peptides, including dearginine 9-retarded peptide, apelin, neurohypertensin, morphine A and gastric hunger hormone.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronaviruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">More specifically, the S1 thorny protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 binds to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface, leading to endocytosis, causing the virus and enzyme to co-transpose into the nuclear inner body in the cell.</seg>
<seg id="17">This entry process also requires the activation of S protein by host serine protease TMPRSS2. The inhibition of this process is currently being studied as a potential treatment. Some speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, several professional associations and regulators recommend the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group".</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, "for patients with a high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, the use of ACE inhibitors will also reduce the risk of pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but the results are not as reliable as reducing the overall risk of pneumonia."</seg>
<seg id="22">Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new method for the treatment of acute lung injury. It seems to improve the pulmonary hemodynamic index and blood oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipid polysaccharides.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, the effective time is 30 minutes, and the action process (duration) is 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some studies have shown that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance of the classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor or for diseases with elevated levels of circulating angiotensin II. The efficacy of rhACE2 infusion in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stores in Australia have lowered the ceiling on the number of toilet paper per transaction</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the ceiling on the purchase of toilet paper per transaction in all their stores to two and one packs, respectively, nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">ALDI also introduced a one-pack restriction on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">These restrictions are posted on the cashier's desk or posted on the chain's Facebook page in the form of messages.</seg>
<seg id="5">Buyers hoarded goods for fear of COVID-19 in case they needed to isolate themselves, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the number of door-to-door toilet paper purchases to a single pack.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced a limit of four packs per transaction on March 4 and 5, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="8">In its March 8 press release, Coles reported that after the implementation of the four-pack restriction, "many stores still sold out within an hour of arrival" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a Woolworths spokesman, sales rose "sharply" last week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last week, the Costco store in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two packs.</seg>
<seg id="11">To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packaging from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI prepared stock in advance for the planned Wednesday special.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventories, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made this difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects that as suppliers try to meet demand, production costs will rise and preferential activities will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores would not be able to hold Wednesday's special event after the early release of stockpiles.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a report by News.Com. Au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish their stock every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said that toilet paper is a large item, so the inventory is small. Moreover, once sold out, it will leave a huge shelf space, exacerbating the feeling of material shortage.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The view of Coles and Woolworths is that if there are a lot of things on the shelves, such as rolls of paper and hand sanitizers, that can be [bought] and in sufficient quantities, you may not be so panicked," Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.</seg>
<seg id="18">Who Gives a Crap, a maker of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that it was out of stock.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News.Com. Au, Kimberly-Clark, who makes Shujie toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent toilet paper, both emphasize that they are working around the clock and on weekends to ensure supply.</seg>
<seg id="20">Real estate website Domain.com reported that some real estate agents will offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne because buyers take a long weekend off on Labor Day and hold fewer auctions.</seg>
<seg id="21">NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, includes an eight-page insert in its Thursday edition, designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, stores were initially reluctant to impose purchase restrictions. They said they did not plan to impose purchase restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other goods, including masks, hand sanitizers, dry goods, hand sanitizers and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, outside Australia, Ocado, the UK online supermarket, limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls each on Sunday night.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, our team released the "Rapid Recommendation Guide for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the 2019 New Coronary Virus (2019-nCoV) Infection", through which we provided experience and reference for the global response to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, 2019 Coronary Virus Disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease. Based on the ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our understanding of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we respond to an opinion on the above-mentioned guidelines and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest "COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme (7th Edition)" issued by the National Health and Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) broke out. At present, the disease has been officially named 2019 Coronary Virus Disease (COVID-19). The virus was once named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 Coronary Virus (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On March 11, 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid advice guide, which was published online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since its release, it has attracted wide attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, please note that COVID-19 is a new type of disease. Based on the ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our understanding of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the National Health and Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http:// www.Nhc. Gov.Cn /) published a total of seven editions of the "COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme" between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which have undergone substantial changes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others, who have proposed a simple scoring scheme based on their own clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their work provides new evidence for our guide and a valuable reference for this global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="13">We recognize and thank them for this important work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, their proposal also needs to be updated in the light of the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme (Trial Seventh Edition) and recent research.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases requires a combination of one epidemiological history feature and two clinical manifestations for comprehensive analysis. If there is no clear epidemiological history, three clinical manifestations need to be met:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) had a travel or residence history in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities that reported cases of COVID-19 within 14 days before the onset of symptoms. (2) Have a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (positive nucleic acid test). (3) Had a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities that reported COVID-19 within 14 days before the onset of symptoms. (4) Have a history of contact with confirmed cases of aggregation (≥2 patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a small range within 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms, such as home, office, school class, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or reduced total number of white blood cells and reduced lymphocyte count in the early stages of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="18">The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases and have any of the following etiological or serological evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 is positive. (2) The whole genome sequencing of the virus shows that it is highly homologous with the known new coronavirus. (3) The specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were positive in the serum test. Or the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 changed from negative to positive, or the drop rate increased by ≥4 times during the recovery period, higher than in the acute phase.</seg>
<seg id="19">As we can see, the second edition (January 18, 2020) and the third edition (January 22, 2020) added real-time PCR nucleic acid detection in respiratory or blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (February 8, 2020) added blood specimen etiological detection; the seventh edition later added serological evidence.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers studying the best nucleic acid test kit to achieve rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens, including blood collection, which increases the availability of different specimens and provides evidence for including the positive results of specific antibodies in the diagnosis criteria.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of atypical symptoms and asymptomatic patients.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou and others should be updated, as they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the scoring system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and call on readers to give their opinions.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend referring to and following the latest guidelines of the country where the case is located.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team will also update our guidelines in time to help.</seg>

<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new cases of COVID-19 deaths on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="3">This set a new high in the number of single-day deaths caused by the virus.</seg>
<seg id="4">As of yesterday, in the records of infection cases reported by the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), there were 114 confirmed cases and 33 cured after rest at home.</seg>
<seg id="5">A total of 17 deaths were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="6">At an online news conference, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, head of the IEDCR, said the deaths included four men and one woman.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over the age of 60, two were between the ages of 51 and 60 and one was between the ages of 41 and 50.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also said that two of the dead patients were from Dhaka.</seg>
<seg id="9">The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.</seg>
<seg id="10">A hospital official told the local news media Anadolu Agency that one of the dead patients was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, announced via online video that the suspension of public transport would be extended beyond the original plan until this Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The suspension of public transport began on March 26 and was originally scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.</seg>
<seg id="13">Basic goods such as medical care, fuel and food can still be transported normally.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 8, of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh, two returned from Italy and one patient was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.</seg>
<seg id="15">As of March 19, all three patients had recovered.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease and not to the level of risk of a particular case, the WHO points out that the government needs to be urged to take measures:</seg>
<seg id="4">"All countries/regions can still change the course of this pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="5">If countries/regions test, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people as a response," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are deeply concerned about the alarming level of proliferation and severity and the alarming level of inaction."</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="8">"With the exception of influenza, no respiratory virus has been found to continue to spread around the world after its emergence," he commented on CNN in February.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said, "We have never seen a coronavirus-induced pandemic before."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Similarly, we have never seen a controlled virus pandemic before," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="11">Before entering the new state of the pandemic, the WHO determined in January that the outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "Most importantly, it is still deteriorating."</seg>
<seg id="13">As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.</seg>

<seg id="12">On April 12, the government announced that the Close Contact Tracker application has entered an advanced stage of development and will be put into use in the coming weeks. Ireland and France also plan to launch similar applications ("StopCovid").</seg>
<seg id="13">Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geographical fence application for confirmed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, a professor of safety engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed some practical problems that may exist in the application system, including false positive misreporting and the possible lack of effectiveness if only a small proportion of the population uses the application.</seg>
<seg id="15">To prevent the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can publish coronavirus-related applications in the Apple App Store, that is, only "official" or other reputable organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy advocates say they are concerned about the use of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus epidemic should be dismantled after the threat of the epidemic is eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="19">These organizations have announced eight conditions to be met for government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";</seg>
<seg id="21">Monitoring and surveillance expansion must have a "sunset" clause;</seg>
<seg id="22">The data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes;</seg>
<seg id="23">Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence that they are actually protected;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Any data sharing with third parties should be defined in accordance with the law;</seg>
<seg id="26">Safeguards must be provided to prevent data abuse and to provide citizens with the right to deal with data abuse;</seg>
<seg id="27">All "relevant stakeholders" are required to "participate effectively," including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also issued verification lists.</seg>
<seg id="28">The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of continuous monitoring and remove it from the device operating system once tracking is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some countries have adopted web-based rather than application-based location tracking. Users do not need to download the application, while avoiding being tracked.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network solutions that can access raw location data may have serious privacy problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with their own central servers need access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that use only central servers to communicate with each other have now been created (see below for details).</seg>
<seg id="33">South Korea has introduced a system that is not application-based to perform contact tracing tasks.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using specialized applications, the system chose to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine this information to send notifications to potential infected people through text messages.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the government has also been allowed to disclose location information, as the country has made major adjustments to its information privacy law following the outbreak of the MERS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="36">The public can access this information through many applications and websites. Other countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and privacy protection systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of April 6, 2020, no specific details have been released.</seg>
<seg id="38">Privacy Protection Close Contact Tracking is a recognized concept. A large number of relevant research literature dates back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were studying privacy protection solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Power Consumption (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">PEPP-PT is a coordinated scheme that includes a centralized and decentralized approach. It is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, formerly known as contact event number (CEN)), privacy-sensitive protocol and mobile contact tracking mechanism (PACT).</seg>
<seg id="40">Under these agreements, identifiable personal data will never leave the device, and all matches are made on the device.</seg>
<seg id="41">The privacy team at the MIT Media Lab has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or path cross-data to track COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">The platform is based on the research content of the white paper "Application rogueization: safeguarding personal privacy in an epidemic", released in March 2020. In addition, Enigma MPC, a company originally founded at the MIT Media Lab and committed to developing privacy technology, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to support users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.</seg>
<seg id="44">On April 5, 2020, some groups jointly formed the Global TCN Alliance around essentially the same methods and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmented information and supporting the global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, which is a key to achieving wide application.</seg>
<seg id="45">On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that its official government application uses the open source BlueTrace protocol.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, respectively, announced a close contact tracking plan, claiming that the plan combines Bluetooth low-power technology with privacy protection encryption technology to protect privacy.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, they published the core technical specifications used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be rolled out in three phases:</seg>
<seg id="49">Launch tools to support the government in creating official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy</seg>
<seg id="50">By integrating this feature directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to launch the system first through operating system updates. After the epidemic threat, the system will be deleted in the same way to solve the follow-up monitoring problem.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is the act of cleaning the hands to remove dust, grease, microbes or other useless substances from the hands.</seg>
<seg id="2">Insisting on washing hands with soap at certain "critical moments" of the day can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which can be transmitted through fecal-oral channels.</seg>
<seg id="3">If people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">Be sure to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's hips or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before meals, before and after handling food or before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If there is no soap or water, you can clean your hands with grass ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands under the following circumstances:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after preparing food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after taking care of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing diapers or cleaning the hips of children in the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="9">After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching animals, animal food or animal dung.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hand hygiene of medical personnel refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Washing hands before dispensing medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals from the hands that may harm the human body or cause disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hand washing is particularly important for people engaged in food processing or working in the medical field, but it is also a very important practice for the public.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections;</seg>
<seg id="16">And reduce the infant mortality rate during delivery at home.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study showed that improving hand-washing habits had a slight effect on the height increase of children under the age of five.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by advocating simple behavioral changes (for example, washing hands with soap).</seg>
<seg id="19">This simple act can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by nearly 50%.</seg>
<seg id="20">Advocating hand washing as an intervention can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about one-third, the effect of which is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">Washing hands with soap can reduce diarrhea incidents by 48%. As a spontaneous behavior in families, schools and communities around the world, washing hands with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI).</seg>
<seg id="22">As a major acute respiratory infection, pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five. Pneumonia kills about 1.8 million children every year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhea and pneumonia cause a total of nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the United Nations Children's Fund, turning washing hands with soap before meals and after going to the toilet into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">As part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, hand washing is often promoted along with other hygiene interventions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing can also prevent pustular disease transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hand washing can have a slight adverse effect, that is, frequent hand washing can lead to dry skin, which can cause skin damage.</seg>
<seg id="28">A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy and cracked skin, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Excessive frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">To reduce the fecal-oral transmission of the disease, it is important to wash hands with soap at five key times of the day: after going to the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning the child's hips (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before meals and before and after handling food or after handling raw meat, fish or raw poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">In order to prevent the spread of disease, hand washing should also be done in the correct way in the following situations: before and after handling the incision or wound; after sneezing, coughing or wiping the nose; after touching animal dung or handling animals; and after touching garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">In many countries/regions, the proportion of hand washing with soap is very low.</seg>
<seg id="33">A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households had the habit of using soap to wash their hands. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest proportion, at 97%; the United States was close to the average, at 77%; and China had the lowest proportion, at 23%. Now, in order to promote the behavior of washing hands with soap at key times, a number of behavior change methods have been implemented. In order for children to develop the habit of hand washing, developing countries can choose to let school children wash their hands in groups on a regular basis every day.</seg>
<seg id="34">The "Basic Health Care Plan" implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and schooling.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the heart of this national plan is deworming twice a year, supplemented by washing hands with soap and brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste every day.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Indonesia, the scheme has also been successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="37">Adding soap or detergent to the water can better remove microorganisms from the skin.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce dissolving obstacles and improve solubility.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water alone cannot effectively clean the skin because fats and proteins (components of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, clean hand washing requires reasonable water...</seg>
<seg id="41">Because solid soap can be reused, it may retain bacteria left over from previous use.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap and concluded that bacteria could not be transferred because they would be washed away by foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the CDC still claims that "it is best to choose non-contact liquid soap."</seg>
<seg id="44">Antimicrobial soap has been vigorously promoted among the health-conscious public.</seg>
<seg id="45">So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in nature have been selected using recommended antimicrobial agents or disinfectants.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antimicrobial soap contains common antimicrobial agents such as trichlorosa, which has a large number of drug-resistant microbial strains.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, even if antimicrobial soap is not chosen for the sake of antibiotic-resistant strains, antimicrobial soap may not be as effective as advertised.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to surfactants and skin care agents, complex formulations may also contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and more skin conditioners (aloe, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon shows that in terms of preventing disease and removing bacteria from hands, ordinary soap has the same effect as consumer-grade antimicrobial soap containing trichlorosa.</seg>
<seg id="49">Washing hands in hot water is comfortable, but its heat is not enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria breed quickly at body temperature (37°C).</seg>
<seg id="51">However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes on hand, contrary to popular belief.</seg>
<seg id="53">Water-free hand sanitizer or wash-free sterilization hand sanitizer is a non-water-based hand cleaner.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early 2000s, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaners (also known as alcohol hand rubbing fluid, wash-free sterilization hand rubbing fluid or wash-free hand washing fluid) were very popular.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most of the formulations of these hand sanitizers contain isopropanol or ethanol, then add thickeners such as kapom (acrylic polymer) to form a gel, or add moisturizers such as glycerin to form a liquid, or foam to make it easy to use and relieve the dry skin caused by alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide can further increase antibacterial activity. Wash-free hand sanitizers containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol can effectively kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol rubbing can kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE)), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, bovine pox, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">After 30 seconds of using alcohol rubbing solution with 70% alcohol content, it can kill 99.97% of the bacteria on the hand (a decrease of 3.5 orders of magnitude, similar to a decrease of 35 decibels). After 1 minute of rubbing, it can reduce 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude) of the bacteria on the hand. Wash-free hand washing solution is the most effective for bacteria, while it is slightly less effective for some viruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">Alcohol hand rubbing is almost completely ineffective against viruses such as norovirus (also known as Norwalk) (the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis). Sufficient wash-free sterilization or alcohol hand rubbing fluid must be used to thoroughly moisten or cover the hands.</seg>
<seg id="60">Rub the palm and back of the hand, as well as between the fingers and the end of all fingers, for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel drys.</seg>
<seg id="61">Fingertips must also be fully washed and rubbed on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using wash-free hand rubbing fluid, especially when the hands look dirty.</seg>
<seg id="62">Such hand rubbing fluids are increasingly used because they are easy to use and can quickly inactivate microbes; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.</seg>
<seg id="63">Frequent use of alcohol-free hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless moisturizers and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.</seg>
<seg id="64">Glycerin and/or other moisturizers can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate alcohol-induced skin dryness.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, alcohol-free hand sanitizers containing moisturizers can significantly reduce the occurrence of skin irritation and skin dryness compared with soap or antimicrobial detergents.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic contact with dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or allergies to alcohol or additives in alcohol rubbing fluid are rare.</seg>
<seg id="67">Compared with washing hands with soap and water, alcohol-free hand sanitizers are less likely to induce irritating contact dermatitis, which is one reason for their attractiveness.</seg>
<seg id="68">Although anhydrous detergent is effective, it does not remove organic matter from the hands, but only disinfects it.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, wash-free hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, which are still in hand.</seg>
<seg id="70">The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends to a large extent on the composition and formula. Its effect has always been much worse than that of alcohol and alcohol hand rubbing fluid.</seg>
<seg id="71">Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to gradually causing adverse skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use grass ash or soil instead.</seg>
<seg id="73">Grass ash or soil is better than washing hands with water alone, but not as good as soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may accelerate the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, grass ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it meets water.</seg>
<seg id="76">The WHO recommends replacing soap with grass ash or sand if no soap is available.</seg>
<seg id="77">The correct hand washing recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of disease is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="78">Wet your hands with flowing warm or cool water.</seg>
<seg id="79">Running water is recommended because vertical basins may be contaminated, and water temperature does not seem to matter much.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wash repeatedly with sufficient amount of soap to produce foam, while cleaning the back of hands, between fingers and nail seams.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies have shown that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of washing their hands with water alone.</seg>
<seg id="82">Wash for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Rubbing can produce friction, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin. The longer the rubbing time, the more bacteria will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="84">Wash thoroughly with running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Washing hands with a basin can cause re-contamination.</seg>
<seg id="86">Dry with a clean towel or dry naturally.</seg>
<seg id="87">Wet hands are more likely to be re-contaminated. Thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and nail seams are the most often overlooked areas.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may hide microbes.</seg>
<seg id="89">Moisturizing lotion is usually recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage, increasing the risk of infection transmission.</seg>
<seg id="90">Where developing countries do not have access to running water and/or soap, a variety of low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, such as pouring water through a hanging bucket or holed gourd and/or washing hands with grass ash (if necessary). Where water supply is limited (for example, schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving hand washing schemes, such as simple taps and other low-cost methods, can be used.</seg>
<seg id="91">The technique of a simple faucet is simple. Hang a water can with a rope, then pour a small amount of water into your hand through a pedal and use soap.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effectively drying hands is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there is still some debate about the most effective way to dry hands in public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="93">More and more studies have shown that paper towels are more hygienic than the electric dry mobile phones provided in many bathrooms.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium of the paper towel industry to compare the sanitary levels of paper towels, warm-air dry phones and more modern jet dry phones.</seg>
<seg id="95">After washing hands, dry hands with warm-air dry mobile phones. It was found that the total amount of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194% and the total amount of bacteria on the palms of the hands increased by an average of 254%.</seg>
<seg id="96">With jet dry mobile phone hands, the total amount of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42%, and the total amount of bacteria on the palms of the hands increased by an average of 15%.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing hands, dry hands with paper towels. The total amount of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and the total amount of bacteria on the palm decreased by an average of 77%. Scientists also conducted various tests to determine whether various dry hands methods may cause cross-infection among other toilet users and toilet facilities.</seg>
<seg id="98">Jet dry phones are said to eject air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph) and can blow away microbes from hands and fuselage, potentially contaminating other toilet users and toilet facilities within 2 m.</seg>
<seg id="99">The use of warm-air dry mobile phones can spread microbes to 0.25 meters outside the dry mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="100">The results of dry hands using paper towels show that there will be no serious microbial transmission. In 2005, Tu V Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate different ways of dry hands.</seg>
<seg id="101">After dry hands, the following changes in the number of bacteria were observed:</seg>
<seg id="102">The study involved many different manufacturers of dry mobile phones. These dry mobile phones were compared with dry hands with paper towels.</seg>
<seg id="103">During the trip, in the absence of soap and water, you can choose to use hand sanitized wet towels to wash your hands.</seg>
<seg id="104">Alcohol-free hand sanitizers should have an alcohol content of at least 60%.</seg>
<seg id="105">Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered in 1846 that hand washing could effectively prevent the spread of diseases in hospitals, but it was a long time before medical personnel were forced to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="106">Hospitals use electronic equipment that provides feedback to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="107">One study found that the infection rate decreased after using these devices.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical personnel should wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using sufficient amounts of soap and water or gel to produce foam and wash all parts of their hands.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hands and fingers are intertwined.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is residue between the nail seams, it can be removed with a hard brush.</seg>
<seg id="111">As the residual moisture on the hand may still contain bacteria, it must be fully cleaned and dried with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying, you should use paper towels to close the tap (if necessary, use paper towels to open the exit door).</seg>
<seg id="113">This prevents re-contamination of the hands due to contact with these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">In medical and health institutions, the purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid transmission.</seg>
<seg id="115">A report in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that in most medical settings, hand washing still does not reach an acceptable level. A large number of medical personnel often forget to wash their hands before touching patients, leading to the spread of microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="116">A study has shown that proper hand washing, together with other simple procedures, can reduce catheter-related blood flow infection rates by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a worksheet to demonstrate standard hand washing and hand rubbing methods in medical institutions.</seg>
<seg id="117">The organization also published a draft hand hygiene guide on its website for public comment.</seg>
<seg id="118">Whitby et al. Made a related review.</seg>
<seg id="119">If regulatory compliance needs to be confirmed, commercial equipment can be measured and verified by counterparty hygiene.</seg>
<seg id="120">The World Health Organization recommends "five moments" for hand washing:</seg>
<seg id="121">After exposure to blood/body fluids</seg>
<seg id="122">Before sterile operation and</seg>
<seg id="123">After taking care of the patient. Adding antimicrobial chemicals to soap ("medicinal soap" or "antimicrobial soap") can make hand washing agents produce bactericidal effects.</seg>
<seg id="124">This sterilization operation may be required before surgery or in an environment with a large number of antibiotic-resistant microbes. When "scrubbing" hands for surgery, there must be faucets that can be turned on and off without contact, hand sanitizers containing chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels used to dry hands after hand washing, sterile brushes for scrubbing and other sterile tools to clean nail seams.</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewelry should be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing the hands and forearm up to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">There is no need for long scrubbing (10 minutes).</seg>
<seg id="128">When flushing, the water on the forearm must be prevented from flowing back to the hand.</seg>
<seg id="129">After washing your hands, use sterile cloth to dry your hands and put on your surgical clothes.</seg>
<seg id="130">In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, it is best to wash hands or use wash-free sterilized hand sanitizer before and after contact with patients.</seg>
<seg id="131">In order to control staphylococcal infection in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from when the frequency of hand washing reaches 20%. When the frequency of cleaning hands increases to more than 35%, the further benefit is extremely limited.</seg>
<seg id="132">Compared with the use of antimicrobial soap, the use of ordinary soap to wash hands can lead to a more than threefold increase in the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food. After comparing the use of alcohol rubbing hands with the use of antimicrobial soap washing hands (washing hands for 30 seconds respectively), it was found that the proportion of bacterial infections using alcohol rubbing hands was 26% lower than that of antimicrobial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, soap and water are more effective in reducing the hand-borne influenza A (HI1N1 influenza A) virus and Clostridium difficile spores than alcohol rubbing fluids. Interventions such as training employees on how to wash their hands, increasing the supply of alcohol rubbing fluids and providing written and oral reminders to employees can be used to improve the hand hygiene of medical institutions.</seg>
<seg id="134">Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in various medical settings.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered a cost-effective and important tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to popularize hand-washing behavior.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there are cheap ways to build hand-washing tables, it is very rare to have hand-washing faucets near every private or public toilet.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be due to deep-rooted habits, not to a lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and advocating the use of soap to wash hands can influence policy formulation, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioral changes among residents.</seg>
<seg id="140">If it is to be effective, it must be monitored and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="141">Through a systematic evaluation of 70 studies, it is found that community-based methods are effective in increasing the proportion of hand washing in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), while social marketing activities are less effective. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is the "three-star method" promoted by the United Nations Children's Fund, which, among other sanitary requirements, encourages schools to take simple and cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="142">When the minimum standard is reached, the school can rise from one star to the highest three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">Hand-washing promotion activities may include the construction of hand-washing tables to reduce disease and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">Another example of hand-washing awareness activities is World Hand-washing Day, which aims to try to achieve behavioral change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund has promoted the use of an emoticon for hand-washing.</seg>
<seg id="145">Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing and disability-avoidance adjusted life years (DALY) in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="146">However, reports show that the cost-effectiveness of promoting hand washing with soap is more significant than other water and sanitation interventions.</seg>
<seg id="147">The first to recognize the importance of hand washing to human health -- especially for those who are physically weak (for example, mothers who have just given birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers) -- were two pioneers in the field of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="148">At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by the stench known as miasma.</seg>
<seg id="149">The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medical-borne infections in the 1980s prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively advocate hand hygiene, emphasizing that hand hygiene is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap in order to protect people from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, in Germany, posters of "correct hand-washing methods" will be hung next to hand-washing pools in public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets.</seg>
<seg id="152">The idiom "Don't wash your hands" means that someone declares that they don't want to be responsible for something or don't want to participate in something.</seg>
<seg id="153">It is derived from the biblical Gospel of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to nail Jesus, and later evolved into a widely used idiom among some English-speaking groups.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up imaginary stains, showing that she feels guilty about her crimes and encouraging her husband to commit them.</seg>
<seg id="155">Studies have shown that people who think of or envisage unethical behavior tend to wash their hands more frequently than others and tend to value hand-washing facilities more.</seg>
<seg id="156">In addition, those who can wash their hands after envisaging unethical behavior are less likely to engage in other "purifying" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">Religion requires hand-washing for sanitary and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand-washing with water but without soap is part of many religious iconic hand-washing rites, including the Baha'i Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, hand-washing rites in Christianity and small cleanliness in Islam. Religion also has sanitary hand-washing regulations, especially after certain behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after going to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after meals.</seg>

<seg id="1">The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, killing more than 3,000 people and causing a huge human disaster.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to the homologous virus SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS, it is more contagious, affecting more elderly people than young people, and more men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In view of the rapid increase of publications related to new crown pneumonia, this paper wants to make a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly developing research topic.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will introduce basic knowledge about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and memorable memory for Chinese people. The outbreak of a new viral disease has forced everyone to stay out of their homes throughout the holiday and for many weeks thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="8">The virus is highly homologous with the Coronary Virus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the related disease is known as Coronary Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to all parts of the country before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients have died.</seg>
<seg id="11">The WHO has warned that COVID-19 has become "the number one public enemy" and that its threat may exceed that of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to data from PubMed (https:// www.Ncbi. Nlm. Nih. Gov/pubmed /), since the virus sequence was first reported to have been isolated from multiple patients on January 7, 2020, more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months, covering virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">This paper aims to summarize the research progress in this emerging subject field.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some pressing issues that remain to be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past, CoV has always been considered a non-lethal pathogen in humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold4.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, this century has encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which broke out in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries, with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, this COVID-19 outbreak is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in Figure 1, 1, Wuhan first reported a number of unexplained cases of pneumonia to the National Health and Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the CoV sequence was announced.</seg>
<seg id="21">On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first case of death.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, it was reported that medical personnel were infected, suggesting that there may be human-to-human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, Wuhan closed the city and closed all public transport.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, the first clinical study of Xinguan pneumonia reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, which is considered to be the starting point for infection from unknown animal sources.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency".</seg>
<seg id="27">By the time this report was released, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2 (Fig.2)).</seg>
<seg id="28">Due to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and severity of the outbreak have yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided an updated description of the epidemic, as shown below (https:// mp. Weixin. Qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages, but the main age group is 30-65 years old.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7%) of the infected persons are over the age of 50, very few are under the age of 20, and only 14 of the infected persons are under the age of 10.</seg>
<seg id="32">More men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000) were infected with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 is mainly concentrated in Hubei and surrounding areas for sexual transmission.</seg>
<seg id="34">COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.</seg>
<seg id="37">The basic regeneration number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the time of large-scale population movement before the Spring Festival in China.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality rate of confirmed cases is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (≥60 years) and severe pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">CoV is a large envelope virus subfamily containing single justice chain RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four genera, namely α, β, γ and δ, of which α-CoV and β-CoV are known to infect humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">The encapsulated thorn glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV binds to its cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide-based peptidase 4 (DPP4), and then undergoes membrane fusion.</seg>
<seg id="44">The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is replicated, the genome RNA, together with envelope glycoprotein and nuclear capsid protein, forms a vesicle containing the viral body, then fuses with the plasma membrane and releases the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">It was found that SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of β-CoV. Of the 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, where the initial outbreak occurred, the genetic consistency exceeded 99.98%.</seg>
<seg id="47">Compared to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra-thin sections of the human airway epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="49">The study found that human ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, compared with SARS-CoV, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a weak binding force to human ACE2, which is consistent with the fact that the severity of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new type of short protein encoded by orf3b and a secretory protein encoded by orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFN β; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or motifs.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. Reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2, which forms a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1, with a resolution of 2.9 A.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that the complex had an open and closed conformation and was assembled into a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing evidence of CoV recognition and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and intermediate host</seg>
<seg id="57">It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through beavers and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">By comparing the systematic development of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% consistent with the two SARS-like CoVs from bats, called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it is unclear what intermediate hosts help the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and its transmission path has yet to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="60">Ji et al. Suggest that snakes are carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involves homologous recombination within the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe that pangolin is a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, given that a CoV found in pangolin, a long-snouted anteater often used in traditional Chinese medicine, has 99% genetic homology with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a huge difference; therefore, concrete evidence has yet to provide decisive results (Figure (Fig.33)).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physical and chemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.</seg>
<seg id="64">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to five days at 20°C and 40%-50% humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may be of a similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat-56°C 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but chlorine is determined not to effectively inactivate the virus.</seg>
<seg id="67">Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so they are susceptible to this new virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">At present, there is no detailed research report on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Fig.4).4).</seg>
<seg id="70">In general, after invading the host, the virus is first identified by the host's inherent immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).</seg>
<seg id="71">Viruses induce inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis through different pathways, which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophages of viral antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus get rid of the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="73">The adaptive immune response will join the fight against the virus in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="74">T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="76">Auxiliary T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help these defense cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing apoptosis of T cells.</seg>
<seg id="78">Humoral immunity, including complements -- such as C3a and C5a -- and antibodies, is also critical to resisting viral infections.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients can neutralize MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system can produce a large number of free radicals locally. These free radicals may cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, lead to multi-organ failure or even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by aggregation, is more likely to affect the elderly and pregnant women with multiple complications.</seg>
<seg id="82">Typically, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impaired immune function have a higher chance of infection than others.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to a study of the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that according to the demographics of 8,866 cases, the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="86">For the health sector, it is very important to adjust the effective isolation time according to the most accurate incubation period, which can prevent asymptomatic infected people from transmitting the virus to others.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, people who come into contact with the virus or are infected usually need to be isolated for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the isolation period be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">Fever is usually the main and first symptom of COVID-19. It can be without any other symptoms. It can also be accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, pharynx pain, running water, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients have difficulty breathing and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="91">Severe cases can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis shock, metabolic acidosis and clotting dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="92">Even if there are no lung imaging abnormalities, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for virus for early diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of various symptoms was: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55%, diarrhea 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.</seg>
<seg id="94">Two recent studies on family aggregation and asymptomatic individual transmission leading to aggregation reported similar results.</seg>
<seg id="95">In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of these patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with the higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Diarrhea (26%) and pharynx pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="98">Among SARS patients, it has been proved that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and pharynx pain (13-25%) are the main symptoms, and about 14%-20% of patients need ventilation support.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of February 14, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 66,576, with a mortality rate of 2%.</seg>
<seg id="100">By comparison, as of November 2002, the death rate of SARS among 8,096 confirmed cases was 10%.</seg>
<seg id="101">For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.</seg>
<seg id="102">An early study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.</seg>
<seg id="103">Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above data show that the diffusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the lethality is lower than that of the latter two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">Aggregation usually occurs in the same family or from the same party or means of transportation, such as cruise ships.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients usually have a travel or residence history in Wuhan or other epidemic areas in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease, or a history of close contact with the infected person or patient.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, thus issuing an alert to extend the isolation time.</seg>
<seg id="109">The number of peripheral blood leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in patients in the early stages of the disease is normal or reduced.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, lymphocytosis with a white blood cell count of &lt;4×109/L -- including a lymphocyte count of &lt;1×109/L -- increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viral blood disease were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="111">Some patients can see an increase in the level of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood. Most patients can see an increase in blood C-reactive protein and blood sink.</seg>
<seg id="112">Severe patients can see an increase in the level of D-dimer, a blood fibrin degradation product, and a progressive decrease in lymphocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="113">Most patients with COVID-19 can see abnormal chest imaging, which is characterized by bilateral patchy shadows or glass-grinding shadows in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="115">When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid build-up and progressive fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">Type I and type II alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction can reduce surfactant levels and increase surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lung to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">As a result, the worst chest imaging findings usually occur at the same time as the worst of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 found alveolar epithelial cell loss, transparent membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and polynuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathological manifestations of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, as the high false negative rate may accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical manifestations for diagnosis on February 13, 2020 (instead of relying solely on RT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="121">A similar situation occurred during the diagnosis of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="122">Therefore, combining medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination and imaging results is essential for effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, Zhang Feng's team reported a scheme to detect SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology. The scheme does not require complex instruments. Using a test paper, synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments with concentrations of only 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies of the virus per micro-liter) can be detected in less than an hour.</seg>
<seg id="124">If verified in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience in treating the new type of CoV, doctors mainly provide support treatment for patients with COVID-19, while trying various treatments that have been used or proposed for other CoVs -- such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV -- and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2). 2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These treatments include current and potential treatments, such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is even recommended that the plasma of recovered patients be used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">SARS-CoV-2 initially primarily attacks the lungs, but may also attack other organs that express ACE2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.</seg>
<seg id="131">Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including routine oxygen absorption, high-flow oxygen absorption, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by external membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and sepsis shock and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.</seg>
<seg id="134">It is well known that the overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS can lead to cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="135">Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a range of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="138">Corticosteroids and toad monoclonal antibody -- an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody -- have been used to treat cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include: regulating the T-cell directed immune response; blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; Bonatumab; cytokine signal transduction inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">As an immunosuppressant, steroids are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, large doses of steroids are not beneficial to severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="142">On the contrary, they may cause serious side effects, especially ischemic bone necrosis, which can seriously affect the prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nevertheless, it is recommended that patients with critical COVID-19 be carefully treated with medium-and low-dose corticosteroids for short-term treatment.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, the existence of effective antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, the intravenous administration of Redsive, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in a patient with COVID-19 in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="146">Redsive is a new antiviral drug developed by Gillid. It was originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola virus and Marburg virus.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, it was also proved that Redsive may inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.</seg>
<seg id="148">For these reasons, Gillid has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the results of which are expected.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, Barricktini, alpha-interferon, Lopinave/Litonave and ribavirin have been recommended as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combined Lopinave/Litonave treatment.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma and antibody production in recovered patients</seg>
<seg id="153">Patients recovering from an infectious disease have a long history of collecting blood to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="154">In fact, recovered patients usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies. They can identify unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this principle, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and then injected into 10 critical patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Their symptoms improved within 24 hours. At the same time, they found a decrease in inflammation and viral load and an increase in blood oxygen saturation.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, before developing specific therapies, it is necessary to verify and clarify to propose methods that can be used on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, considering the therapeutic effect, some shortcomings related to plasma should be carefully considered.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a toxic reaction that can be life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and there is a great demand for plasma to treat critical patients.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Therefore, a more critical and practical approach is to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that encodes effective antibodies, or to screen effective antibodies against the proteins necessary for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">In this way, we can easily expand the production scale of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">In China, TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its therapeutic effect depends to a large extent on the combination of many ingredients in the prescription, which is different from the disease diagnosis according to TCM theory.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most active ingredients are still unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their optimal combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">At present, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatment methods for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe stage.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, Shufeng detoxification capsules and Lianhuaqing distemper capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="170">In several provinces of China, 87% of patients used TCM treatment. Among them, the highest cure rate of COVID-19 patients was observed, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province used TCM treatment only in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest cure rate (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other influencing factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18, 2020, Zhang Boli and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (WM) alone with the treatment of WM and TCM combined.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the time required for temperature recovery, symptom disappearance and hospitalization in the WM+TCM group was significantly shorter than in the simple WM group.</seg>
<seg id="174">Most impressively, the symptom deterioration rate of the WM+TCM group (from light to heavy) was significantly lower than that of the simple WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate of the WM+TCM group was also lower than that of the simple WM group (8.8% versus 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still need to be confirmed by higher-quality control tests, larger scope and more centers.</seg>
<seg id="176">It will also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of TCM treatment or its combination and, where possible, to clarify its active ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="177">Most patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 will have great fear due to this highly infectious and even lethal disease, and those isolated will also feel depressed, lonely and angry.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse reactions to treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychological reactions were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicide.</seg>
<seg id="180">As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracing and isolation can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of infection, isolation and stigma on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines are critical to disrupting the transmission chain from animal hosts and infected patients to susceptible hosts, and are often used as a complement to antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">The industry has made efforts to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunization against SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">The live attenuated vaccine has been evaluated in the animal model of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, before initiating clinical research, the in vivo effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the elderly and lethal attack models and their protective effect on human-animal co-infection have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is likely because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.</seg>
<seg id="188">In contrast, due to the persistence of human-animal co-morbidity sources in the affected areas, sporadic cases and aggregation of MERS persist in the Middle East and spread to other regions.</seg>
<seg id="189">Through the use of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus carriers, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.</seg>
<seg id="190">Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the current epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time required for vaccine development (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic changes of CoV.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its complete clinical process in thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients can gradually recover without after-effects.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, similar to SARS and MERS, patients with severe COVID-19 also have high morbidity and mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="195">Therefore, establishing a prognostic model of the disease is essential for health-care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="196">According to the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age is the most important factor affecting the prognosis of SARS, as well as for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">As mentioned earlier, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurred in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7% of patients were over the age of 50.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients who need intensive care are more likely to have basic complications and complications, and are significantly older than those who do not need intensive care (the median age is 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor in the outcome of patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="200">Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men than women are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000).</seg>
<seg id="201">Complications and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to have acute heart damage and arrhythmia.</seg>
<seg id="202">Heart events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="203">It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive bile duct cells, which may lead to abnormal liver function in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may affect each other.</seg>
<seg id="205">The results of laboratory tests are abnormal: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been seen as a potential prognostic factor for disease, therapeutic response and eventual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">It has also been suggested that there is a correlation between the level of CRP and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help to predict the outcome.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.</seg>
<seg id="209">Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Main clinical symptoms: the time progress of chest imaging examination and clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="211">Use of steroids: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immunosuppressants and are usually used as adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="212">As large doses of corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffer from ischemic bone necrosis, leading to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in small doses and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients were under great pressure because they often suffered from long-term isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of relatives and sick friends.</seg>
<seg id="215">Psychological counseling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get out of stress and return to normal life.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from those of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or asymptomatic symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, the infected person will produce a large number of viruses in the course of daily activities in the early stage or incubation period, which will bring great difficulties to the control of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, the spread of SARS-CoV is thought to occur when the patient is seriously ill, and most of the transmission does not occur at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="220">Therefore, compared with SARS, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more serious and difficult to control.</seg>
<seg id="221">At present, China is making great efforts, including blocking Wuhan and surrounding cities, as well as continuously isolating almost all the population, with a view to interrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these measures have caused serious damage to China's economy and other aspects, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the pace of development of the epidemic is slowing down.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase will last for three to four months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, some other experts are not so optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Paul Hunter and others estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Ira Longini et al. Established a model to predict the consequences of the epidemic, believing that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A Canadian team reported that patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital two weeks ago detected SARS-CoV-2 in both the middle turbinate and pharynx swabs, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, as the number of new cases has decreased, there have been encouraging signs in China that the current strategy may have worked.</seg>
<seg id="229">The Ebola virus had been predicted to cause 1 million cases and 500,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="230">However, through strict isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.</seg>
<seg id="231">Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less contagious and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with the human body.</seg>
<seg id="232">A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Figure (Fig. 55)).</seg>
<seg id="233">SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, or even by direct contact with items contaminated with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus has also been found in feces, increasing the possibility of fecal mouth transmission.</seg>
<seg id="235">A recent study, which included 138 cases, reported that 41% of the cases may have been caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients who had previously suffered from other diseases and 40 medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="236">Therefore, stricter preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, especially medical personnel, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have had contact with patients or infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) both help control the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks can prevent droplets from potential infected people from spreading in the air or sticking to the surface of items that may be passed on to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only the N95 (1860s series) mask can prevent the inhalation of virus bodies as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virus bodies can fully penetrate; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV, both at about 85 nm.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since virus particles can even penetrate five stacked surgical masks, medical personnel in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks rather than surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, medical personnel should also wear isolation suits to further reduce contact with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="242">The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or goggles when facing patients.</seg>
<seg id="245">For the public in areas affected by or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than usual, stay indoors as much as possible to isolate themselves, and limit contact with potential infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="246">Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from patients.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new type of virus, based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003, its high homology with SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020 should have aroused China's high vigilance.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control was still appeasing the public, saying that the new virus is not very infectious, the possibility of human-to-human transmission is limited, and the epidemic can be prevented and controlled.</seg>
<seg id="250">This news obviously relaxed the public's vigilance, and on the eve of the Spring Festival, the key node to contain the epidemic in Wuhan was thus missed.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's disease control agencies may learn from this painful lesson and make major improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, these institutions should (1) be more cautious in issuing public announcements, as every word is critical to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions. (2) Be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for a formal report from a doctor or official. (3) Control potential epidemics more strictly at an early stage rather than trying to appease the public. And (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve the social response system.</seg>
<seg id="253">The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, began at the end of December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">At the time of writing, in less than two months, it had spread to all of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="255">Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 looks like a recurrence of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">More elderly people than young people are affected by COVID-19, more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate of elderly patients are higher than that of young patients.</seg>
<seg id="258">The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).</seg>
<seg id="259">Even if there are no symptoms, COVID-19 patients still transmit the virus, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus only when the condition is serious, which makes it much more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This partly explains why the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is far more rapid and widespread than that of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">In some COVID-19 patients, the conventional RNA test results of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, patients who have been cured may turn to the sun again.</seg>
<seg id="263">These findings greatly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">Considering that the research on COVID-19 is so rapid, the following key issues remain to be resolved:</seg>
<seg id="265">Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?</seg>
<seg id="266">Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats SARS-like CoV, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal is the intermediate host that transmits the virus from its original host, assumed to be a bat, to humans?</seg>
<seg id="268">If we do not know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to effectively cut off the transmission route, and the outbreak may recur at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Although molecular models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Does the virus also bind cells that express ACE2 in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the epidemic last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it become a global pandemic? Will it disappear like SARS? Or will it recur as regularly as influenza?</seg>
<seg id="275">Finding answers to these and many other questions is crucial, but it may take a long time.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, no matter how costly, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.</seg>

<seg id="1">B'A COVID-19 vaccine refers to a hypothetical vaccine for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="2">Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, many attempts to develop such a vaccine are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="3">In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it expected that there would be no vaccine against the pathogenic virus SARS-CoV-2 within 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In April, five candidate vaccines entered the Phase I safety study.</seg>
<seg id="5">COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2020, a large-scale epidemic spread around the world, triggering a great deal of investment and research activities in the development of vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations are using the published virus genome to develop a possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="8">CEPI proposed a vaccine development plan in April and said the top priorities were speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were studying and developing an effective COVID-19 vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main platform targets for entering the Phase I safety study include:</seg>
<seg id="11">Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">Virus vector (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)</seg>
<seg id="13">CEPI scientists reported in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and another 37 have been announced, but there is little public information (it is speculated that they are being planned or designed).</seg>
<seg id="14">The phase I-II test conducted a preliminary safety and immunogenicity test, usually a randomized, placebo-controlled multi-point test, while determining a more accurate and effective dose.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at the best dose.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (still in "preclinical" research).</seg>
<seg id="17">Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that could genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced that it would begin developing a vaccine, with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">The China Center for Disease Prevention and Control and the University of Hong Kong announced vaccine development projects on January 26 and January 28, 2020, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="20">Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun developing a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Janssen is working with its biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to jointly develop a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="23">On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Research Office in Romania published a paper on vaccine design, using techniques similar to those used in new antigen immunotherapy for cancer.</seg>
<seg id="24">On March 25, the director of the institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and started testing the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="25">On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it was starting a vaccine project to develop an Ii-Key peptide vaccine for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="26">They hope to develop a candidate vaccine and be able to conduct human trials "within 90 days."</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development project.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materials Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute in Silver Spring (both in western Maryland) announced that they were developing a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="29">Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a partnership with Novavax Inc.</seg>
<seg id="30">Development and production of vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="31">The two agencies further announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.</seg>
<seg id="32">On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that 11 separate strains are being studied. Even if the progress is accelerated, it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="33">On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that a virus-like particle of coronavirus had been developed with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health.</seg>
<seg id="34">The candidate vaccine is under laboratory study and is scheduled to enter human trials in July or August 2020.</seg>
<seg id="35">Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had provided CureVac with "'large sums of money' to obtain exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine", which the German government protested.</seg>
<seg id="36">On March 17, 2020, Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical company, announced that it would work with BioNTech, a German company, to develop a mRNA-based vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="37">The mRNA-based candidate vaccine, BNT162, is currently in the preclinical testing phase and is expected to begin clinical trials in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="38">On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that they would obtain preclinical test results in April 2020 and that their final candidate vaccine might begin human trials in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="39">On March 19, 2020, in France, the Alliance for Innovation in Epidemiological Prevention (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million to establish a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance composed of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the research and development of COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other CEPI investment partners in COVID-19 vaccine research and development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="41">On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different candidate vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="42">Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="43">The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the virus sequence released by China.</seg>
<seg id="44">In late March, the Government of Canada announced an allocation of $275 million to fund 96 medical response research projects for COVID-19, including numerous candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan program.</seg>
<seg id="45">Around the same time, the Canadian government announced that it would devote $192 million to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and planned to establish a national "vaccine bank", including several new vaccines, so that these vaccines could be put into use in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the testing of PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine that may be used in mice, and said that "the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine provided by the MNA can enable [mice] to produce a strong antigen-specific antibody response, which begins to appear two weeks after immunization".</seg>
<seg id="47">On April 16, 2020, the School of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo, Canada, announced the design of a DNA-based candidate vaccine as a possible nasal spray.</seg>
<seg id="48">Using bacteriophages, the researchers designed DNA to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="49">In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources and combined cloud computing resources from Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM's supercomputers.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as nonspecific effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means that, in addition to preventing disease, they can bring other benefits.</seg>
<seg id="52">Further randomized trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health-care workers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Vaccines under development may be unsafe or ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Early studies using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates, to assess the efficacy of vaccines revealed the need for biosafety level 3 containment measures to deal with live viruses and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.</seg>
<seg id="55">Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of 2020, there is no safe and effective SARS treatment or preventive vaccine for humans.</seg>
<seg id="57">According to the research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is a top priority for governments and public health institutions all over the world. In addition, there is currently no effective vaccine for MERS.</seg>
<seg id="58">At the time of the MERS epidemic, it was thought that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infection.</seg>
<seg id="59">As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I human clinical trials, and three other vaccines are under development, all of which are virus carrier vaccines, two are adenovirus carrier vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one is MVA carrier vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).</seg>
<seg id="60">Various social media articles fueled conspiracy theories, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 had been found and that a vaccine was available.</seg>
<seg id="61">The patents cited in various social media articles refer to existing patents for gene sequences and vaccines of other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019-2020 coronavirus epidemic is a new type of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that continues to spread and is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It was listed as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as an epidemic on March 11, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="3">As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases and about 97,000 deaths had been reported in 210 countries and regions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 364,000 people were cured.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mortality rate in China is about 4%, while the mortality rate in all regions of the world is between 0.08% (New Zealand) and 13.04% (Algeria).</seg>
<seg id="6">Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">And may be accompanied by pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and other complications.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incubation period from contact with the patient to the onset of the disease ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="9">At present, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinical treatment focuses on symptomatic support treatment. The recommended preventive measures include washing hands frequently, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining a safe distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspected infected persons, etc.</seg>
<seg id="11">Official agencies in various countries have taken countermeasures such as travel restrictions, isolation, curfews, workplace hazard prevention and control and closure of facilities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The epidemic has led to a serious impact on the global social economy. Sports, religious, political and cultural activities have been postponed or canceled, while panic shopping has exacerbated the widespread supply shortage.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the world, 193 countries and regions have implemented national or local suspension measures, affecting about 99.4% of primary, secondary and tertiary students.</seg>
<seg id="14">Due to the spread of false virus information on the Internet, there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other groups of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as groups in areas with serious epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries have reduced the air pollution index and reduced carbon emissions.</seg>
<seg id="16">On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a number of cases of unexplained pneumonia, and launched an investigation in early January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most of these cases are related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, so the new crown virus is considered to be a human-animal disease.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first patients found were later confirmed to have developed the disease on December 1, 2019, and there was no obvious link to the subsequent batch of cases in the South China seafood market.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China seafood market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report, saying that the first case may date back to November 17, 2019. The patient is a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, according to the World Health Organization, the number of newly reported cases in China decreased, but the number of newly reported cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea suddenly increased significantly, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases in China for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="21">There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially mild cases.</seg>
<seg id="22">As of February 26, relatively few cases of adolescents had been reported, with only 2.4% of adolescents aged 19 and under worldwide. Patrick Valance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimates that about 60% of the UK population needs to be infected with the new crown virus in order to obtain effective group immunization.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be positive according to the official program.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of March 23, the proportion of groups tested in all countries in the world did not exceed 3% of the total population. Many countries have also issued official policies not to test people with mild diseases, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a study published on March 16, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infected people in China had not been tested, and these undocumented infected people were the source of 79% of recorded cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, it is estimated that the actual number of infections in Italy far exceeds the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">The basic infectious number (R0) of COVID-19 was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that R0 may be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most patients with COVID-19 can recover.</seg>
<seg id="30">The time between onset and death of patients who cannot recover is 6-41 days, with 14 days being the most common.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 people had died from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">As of February 5, about 80% of the deaths in China were among people over the age of 60, and 75% of the deaths were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official statistics of COVID-19 deaths usually refer to those who, according to the official scheme, tested positive for the new crown virus.</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may far exceed the statistics, as the data may not include patients who have not been tested, such as those who have died at home, in nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times the official number of deaths from new crown virus pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokeswoman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted: "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual value", and the rumor that the United States data is underestimated also confirms this statement. Underestimation often occurs in the field of epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. On January 9, 2020, the first confirmed death case in China occurred in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="36">On February 1, the first death outside China occurred in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first death outside Asia occurred in France.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of February 28, there were more than a dozen deaths outside China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">As of March 13, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported death cases. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="39">These figures vary from region to region and change over time and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as test measurements, the quality of the health system, treatment programs, the time of the first outbreak of the epidemic and age, sex and overall health status. The case fatality rate is the result of dividing the number of deaths in a given period of time by the number of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global case fatality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).</seg>
<seg id="41">Mortality rates vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the estimated case fatality rate fell from 17.3% (patients who fell ill from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (patients who fell ill after February 1, 2020). Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR) and infection mortality rate (IFR). The former reflects the number of disease deaths as a percentage of the number of people diagnosed, while the latter reflects the number of disease deaths as a percentage of the number of people infected (including the number of people diagnosed and those not diagnosed).</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics have no time limit and track the whole process of a particular population from infection to case resolution.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many scholars have tried to calculate the above data for specific groups of people.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Oxford University Center for Evidence-based Medicine estimates that the overall infection mortality rate of the epidemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The upper limit of the estimated value of this range is in line with the first random detection of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis study on the impact of the detection on the estimated value of CFR.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization says the outbreak is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni, from Penn State University, said: "If left unchecked, infectious disease outbreaks usually enter a period of stagnation after existing hosts are exhausted and then begin to ease.</seg>
<seg id="50">But at present, it is almost impossible for us to reasonably predict when the inflection point will occur."</seg>
<seg id="51">Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, believes that if all countries mobilize and adopt the recommendation of the World Health Organization to take measures to stop the spread of the virus, "the end of the epidemic in June can be expected".</seg>
<seg id="52">On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 "may erupt repeatedly for one to two years."</seg>
<seg id="53">A study led by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of Technology showed that physical distance and other measures must be taken "before the vaccine is put into use (which may take 18 months or more)".</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner, from Vanderbilt University, said: "This coronavirus is highly contagious and I don't think it's likely to disappear completely" and "could turn into a seasonal disease that erupts once a year."</seg>
<seg id="55">The pathogenicity of a re-outbreak depends on the immunity of the population and the degree of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some infected people may be asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (sputum), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. According to the World Health Organization, about one in six patients will become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="59">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists dyspnea, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden blurred consciousness, difficulty waking up and blue face or lips as emergency symptoms. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">Some infected people may be asymptomatic and have no clinical manifestations, but the test results are positive, so the researchers recommend close observation and examination of the close contacts of the diagnosed patients to rule out the possibility of infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">China estimates that the rate of asymptomatic infections ranges from very low to 44%.</seg>
<seg id="62">The incubation period (the time interval between infection and onset) is generally 1-14 days; 5 days is the most common. With regard to uncertainty, it can be illustrated by an example: the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially estimated at 30%, but later fell to 15%.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details about the route of transmission of the disease have not yet been determined.</seg>
<seg id="64">At present, the disease is thought to be transmitted mainly through close contact and droplets produced during coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact refers to an interval of 1-2 meters (3-6 ft).</seg>
<seg id="65">The study found that unstoppable coughing may cause droplets to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 ft)-8.2 meters (15-27 ft).</seg>
<seg id="66">It has also been suggested that the droplets produced when people speak may also lead to the spread of the virus by staying in the air for a long time. Although the virus usually cannot be transmitted through the air, people may also produce droplets when they exhale or speak.</seg>
<seg id="67">Such droplets may fall into the mouth and nose of the people around them and even be sucked into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may atomize respiratory secretions, leading to air transmission.</seg>
<seg id="69">In addition, if a person touches a surface contaminated with the virus (including skin) and then touches his or her eyes, nose and mouth, it may also lead to the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but this risk is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 fecal transmission. The virus is the most contagious in the first three days after the onset of the disease, but it is also contagious before and after the onset of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="72">Positive results can be detected as early as three days before the onset of the disease, indicating that the new crown virus is infectious before obvious symptoms appear.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are few reports of asymptomatic cases diagnosed in the laboratory, some countries have found asymptomatic infections in the process of contact follow-up investigations.</seg>
<seg id="74">The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although the transmission power of the new crown virus is not completely clear, the average person can infect 2-3 people. The survival time of the virus on the surface of an object ranges from a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="75">Specifically, the new crown virus is known to survive for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature. There have been positive cases of COVID-19 in pets and other animals.</seg>
<seg id="77">At present, there is no evidence that animals will re-transmit the virus to humans, but British official agencies still recommend that people wash their hands after touching animals, just as they touch other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronary Virus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of virus. It was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia in a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronavirus in nature. Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed by household soap because soap can dissolve the protective capsule of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">At present, it is considered a human-animal disease.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis shows that this coronavirus is genetically related to the beta coronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus (B cluster) and two bat-derived virus strains.</seg>
<seg id="82">The new crown virus is 96% consistent with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the genome-wide level.</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that the virus in pangolin is only one amino acid short of the virus on the human body in some parts of the genome sequence.</seg>
<seg id="84">So far, genome-wide comparisons have found that up to 92% of the genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is the same, which is not enough to prove that pangolin is an intermediate host.</seg>
<seg id="85">Whether the virus is infected can be preliminarily diagnosed according to the symptoms, but ultimately it can only be confirmed by the reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretion.</seg>
<seg id="86">A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many imaging features would coincide with other pneumonia and disease development processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommended that "CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease."</seg>
<seg id="88">At present, the World Health Organization has announced a number of nucleic acid detection programs for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.</seg>
<seg id="89">Nucleic acid detection uses real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="90">Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for testing.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results can generally be obtained in a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="92">In general, such tests are carried out through nasopharyngeal swabs and can also be carried out through pharynx swabs. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests for detecting antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of April 6, 2020, none of these testing methods has been confirmed to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the United States, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use only by certified laboratories in emergency situations.</seg>
<seg id="95">The typical imaging characteristics of X-rays and computed tomography (CT) of patients with the disease include asymmetry of peripheral grinding glass and no pleural effusion.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database on the imaging performance of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to its overlap with other viral infections, such as adenoviruses, images not confirmed by PCR have limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="98">A large-scale study in China compared the results of chest CT with those of PCR and found that although the image is less specific to identify infection, it is faster and more sensitive to detect, so it can be considered as a screening method in epidemic areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">At present, a convolutional neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed, which can jointly use X-rays and CT to detect the image characteristics of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="100">Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include good personal hygiene practices, washing hands frequently, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth directly without washing hands, covering the mouth and nose with paper towels when coughing or sneezing, and throwing used paper towels directly into garbage cans.</seg>
<seg id="101">Suspected infected persons should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.</seg>
<seg id="102">In addition, it is recommended to take measures to maintain physical distance to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have restricted or recommended avoiding unnecessary travel to and from countries and regions affected by the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has now reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus is spreading within the community and some community residents do not know where or how they were infected. Medical personnel who come into contact with suspected infected persons should take standard preventive measures, contact preventive measures and eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important means for health regulators to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.</seg>
<seg id="105">The government's use of mobile phone location data for tracking purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations, including Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for restrictions on such surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="106">At present, various mobile applications have been put into use or entered into proposals for people to use voluntarily. As of April 7, 2020, a total of more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection functions, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="107">Once users have had close contact with patients who tested positive for COVID-19, they will receive information reminders. Erroneous statements about the prevention of infection continue to spread; such as rinsing the nose and rinsing the mouth with mouthwash are ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">At present, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is recommended to stop the spread of the disease by washing hands frequently.</seg>
<seg id="110">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when there is obvious dirt on their hands, before meals and after blowing their noses, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is because before the virus enters the human body, it only needs to use household soap to destroy its protective capsule, thus playing a role in killing the virus.</seg>
<seg id="112">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends washing hands with alcohol-containing hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol if there is no soap or running water around.</seg>
<seg id="113">The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">A variety of solutions can be used to disinfect the surface of the object (the disinfectant can work within one minute on the surface of stainless steel), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyvinyl iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other solutions (such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate) are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in facilities such as offices or day-care centers, all areas should be disinfected, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by patients.</seg>
<seg id="117">WHO recommends that people cover their mouth and nose with curved elbows or paper towels when coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of all contaminated paper towels.</seg>
<seg id="118">It is recommended that suspected infected persons wear medical surgical masks, as wearing masks can reduce the amount of droplets emitted during speech, sneezing and coughing and shorten the transmission distance.</seg>
<seg id="119">The World Health Organization has issued instructions on the use of masks and how to use them.</seg>
<seg id="120">Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, believes that "wearing masks can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is also a major source of infection when hand hygiene is not in place". In addition, personnel responsible for caring for suspected infected persons are advised to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="121">The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for patients with COVID-19, but it also recognizes that wearing masks helps to avoid touching their faces.</seg>
<seg id="122">Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="123">The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing non-medical masks made of cloth, while China explicitly recommends that healthy citizens also wear disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact with others (within 1 meter (3 ft)).</seg>
<seg id="124">Hong Kong, China, recommends wearing masks when traveling on public transport or entering crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials advise people to make their own masks and wash them every day.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is strictly prohibited to enter public places without wearing a mask or covering the mouth and nose.</seg>
<seg id="127">On March 16, Vietnam required all people to wear masks to enter public places in order to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian government stipulates that all people are required to wear masks when entering grocery stores.</seg>
<seg id="129">Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.</seg>
<seg id="130">Taiwan, China, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, began requiring masks to be worn on trains and intercity buses on April 1.</seg>
<seg id="131">Panama stipulates that masks must be worn when going out and recommends that residents who cannot buy masks make their own masks.</seg>
<seg id="132">Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Infection prevention and control measures related to maintaining social distance (also known as maintaining physical distance) aim to minimize close contact between people, thereby slowing the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="134">Measures include isolation; travel restrictions; school closures, work stoppages and the closure of stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.</seg>
<seg id="135">With regard to maintaining social distance, the measures that individuals can take include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding entering crowded areas, switching to non-contact greetings and maintaining physical distance from others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Now, many governments have made it mandatory or recommended that areas affected by the epidemic maintain social distance.</seg>
<seg id="137">With regard to the size of the largest population agglomeration, the initial recommendation of the United States government agencies and WHO was 250 (in areas where there was no COVID-19 transmission), which was soon reduced to 50 and later to 10.</seg>
<seg id="138">On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. The elderly and those with diabetes, groups with basic diseases such as heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and impaired immune system have a higher risk of serious diseases and complications. The German Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that such groups living in epidemic areas should not go out as much as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies have begun to replace the term "keeping social distance" with "keeping physical distance" to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while still maintaining social contact, including virtual contact and long-distance contact.</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the term "keeping social distance" implies requiring people to be completely isolated from society and does not encourage people to maintain people-to-people contact in other ways. Some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines applicable during the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="140">The recommendations include having sex only with a partner who lives together and is not infected with the virus or asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is recommended that COVID-19 confirmed patients and suspected infected persons be self-isolated at home.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on correct self-isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended self-isolation on all residents of affected areas.</seg>
<seg id="143">In addition, the most severe self-isolation instructions have been issued to high-risk groups.</seg>
<seg id="144">If you may have been exposed to COVID-19 patients, or have recently been to a country or region with widespread transmission, you will be advised to isolate yourself for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="145">The epidemic prevention and control strategy includes containment/suppression and mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="146">Containment applies to the early stages of an outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolating those infected, while other infection prevention and control and vaccination measures are taken to prevent the spread of the disease to other populations.</seg>
<seg id="147">If it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts should be made to make the transition to the mitigation stage: take measures to slow the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of the disease on the health system and society.</seg>
<seg id="148">Containment and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="149">Suppression requires more extreme prevention and control measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic regenerations to less than 1. Part of the effort to control the outbreak of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, that is, to level the epidemiological curve as we know it.</seg>
<seg id="150">This can reduce the risk of collapse of the health service system and buy more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programs.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-drug interventions that can control the epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-isolation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspending schools and canceling large-scale gatherings; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning. In the face of a marked increase in the epidemic, China immediately took stricter measures to contain the epidemic, such as closing the city and imposing a strict travel ban.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">South Korea has introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures and issued warnings about the trajectory of infected people.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provides financial support to those infected with self-isolation and imposes huge fines on those infected who refuse self-isolation.</seg>
<seg id="155">Taiwan, China, has increased the production of masks and imposed penalties on suppliers of medical supplies who are reluctant to sell their goods. Simulations of the United Kingdom and the United States show that both mitigating (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and curbing (reversing the spread of the epidemic) face major challenges.</seg>
<seg id="156">The best mitigation policy may reduce peak medical needs by two-thirds and the number of deaths by half, but it will still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and cause the health system to collapse.</seg>
<seg id="157">Suppression may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus stops spreading in the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever comes first), otherwise the spread will rebound quickly once the measures are relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term interventions aimed at containing pandemics have social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">At present, no specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is still under way, including the testing of existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">Taking over-the-counter cold medicine, rehydration and rest may help relieve symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusion and respiratory support may be required.</seg>
<seg id="162">The use of steroids may worsen the situation.</seg>
<seg id="163">A number of compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied to determine whether they are suitable for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">The World Health Organization also pointed out that some "traditional and family therapy" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">The World Health Organization pointed out that improving treatment capacity and adjusting the medical system to meet the needs of patients with COVID-19 are basic epidemic response measures.</seg>
<seg id="166">ECDC and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health-care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the concentration of laboratory services in COVID-19 testing, the elimination of selective procedures to the extent possible, the separation and isolation of COVID-19-positive patients and the improvement of intensive care capacity through the training of personnel and the increase in the number of breathing machines and beds available.</seg>
<seg id="167">Speculation about the origin of the first case, known as Patient Zero, is mixed.</seg>
<seg id="168">The first known case of a new type of coronavirus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.</seg>
<seg id="169">Within a month, the number of new coronavirus cases in Hubei Province gradually increased.</seg>
<seg id="170">Most of these patients are related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals. One theory holds that the new coronavirus comes from one of the animals; or, in other words, it originated from the common disease of people and animals. On December 26, Zhang Jixian, a doctor at the Hubei Provincial Hospital for the Integration of Chinese and Western Medicine, first discovered and treated a group of patients with unexplained pneumonia and reported it to the Jianghan District Disease Prevention and Control Center in Wuhan on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="171">On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "SARS-like coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="172">Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading "rumors", while another doctor, Effin, was reprimanded by his superiors for sounding the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee subsequently issued a notice on December 31 and reported it to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="174">After receiving reports of numerous cases of unexplained pneumonia, the Wuhan health department launched an investigation in early January. In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.</seg>
<seg id="175">From the beginning of January to mid-January 2020, under the influence of China's Spring Festival population movement and Wuhan as a transportation hub and major railway hub, the virus spread to other provinces of China.</seg>
<seg id="176">On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.</seg>
<seg id="177">Later official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States had more confirmed cases than China and Italy, making it the country with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, a cumulative total of more than 1.61 million confirmed cases had been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 deaths had been reported and more than 364,000 cases had been cured.</seg>
<seg id="178">About 200 countries and regions around the world have reported confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="179">Affected by the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen Area have adopted prevention and control measures to restrict the free movement of people and establish border controls.</seg>
<seg id="180">National-level response measures include containment, such as isolation (also known as home orders, on-site asylum orders or blockades) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the total population, were under some form of blockade, more than 50 million people in the Philippines were under blockade, about 59 million people in South Africa were under blockade and 1.3 billion people in India were under blockade.</seg>
<seg id="181">On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were under some form of blockade. Two days later, this number increased to 2.6 billion, accounting for about one third of the global population.</seg>
<seg id="182">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report speculates that the earliest case can be traced back to November 17.</seg>
<seg id="183">Dr. Zhang Jixian found a number of unexplained cases of pneumonia on December 26. His hospital reported the situation to the Jianghan District Disease Prevention and Control Center in Wuhan on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="184">On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronaviruses were found in a preliminary genetic test of the patient's sample.</seg>
<seg id="185">The Wuhan Municipal Health and Hygiene Commission issued a notice on December 31,</seg>
<seg id="186">Reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="187">After these notices were issued, several doctors in Wuhan were reprimanded by the police for walking "rumors" of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="188">China's National Health and Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="189">In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign. Later, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, called it a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="190">On January 23, the government announced that it had set up an epidemic prevention line in Wuhan and banned people from entering and leaving Wuhan. The epidemic prevention line was later extended to 15 other cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people, making it "the largest isolation incident in human history".</seg>
<seg id="191">The use of private cars is prohibited in the city.</seg>
<seg id="192">Many places have also canceled the celebration of the Chinese Lunar New Year (January 25).</seg>
<seg id="193">Government departments also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Fire God Mountain Hospital, which will be completed and put into use within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="194">Subsequently, another hospital, Lei Shenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to building new hospitals, China has also transformed 14 other places in Wuhan, such as the conference center and stadium, into square-cabin hospitals. On January 26, the government took further measures to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, including issuing health declaration forms to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.</seg>
<seg id="196">Universities and primary and secondary schools across the country have also been completely closed.</seg>
<seg id="197">Hong Kong, China and Macao have also taken a number of measures, especially for primary and secondary schools and universities.</seg>
<seg id="198">Remote home-based office measures have been implemented in many parts of China.</seg>
<seg id="199">In addition to Hubei Province, travel restrictions have also been imposed on other identities.</seg>
<seg id="200">Public transport has been adjusted and museums across China have been temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="201">Many cities have implemented the control of public activity facilities. It is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been subjected to some form of outdoor activity restriction. After the epidemic entered the global stage in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries and regions.</seg>
<seg id="202">For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day compulsory quarantine on all people entering Beijing from abroad. In the five days before March 23, there was only one local case in mainland China, which was transmitted by a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="203">On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of local cases has been basically contained and the epidemic in China has been brought under control.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the same day, other Hubei regions other than Wuhan began to release travel restrictions exactly two months after the imposition of the blockade. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that foreigners holding valid Chinese visas and residence permits would be suspended from entering the country with effect from March 28. No relevant details were disclosed as to when the policy would end.</seg>
<seg id="205">People who want to enter China need to apply for a visa from the Chinese embassy or consulate.</seg>
<seg id="206">The Chinese government encouraged enterprises and factories to resume work on March 30 and provided a monetary stimulus plan for enterprises. The State Council announced that April 4 would be designated as a national day of mourning and launched a three-minute national silence at 10:00 on the same day. This day coincided with the Qingming Festival. The central government advocated that families jointly mourn their deceased relatives through the Internet in order to maintain physical distance and avoid a second outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="207">On January 20, 2020, there was a confirmed case of COVID-19 in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="208">South Korean health agencies reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases on February 20, mainly due to a new religious movement rally, the New World Jesuit Church, held in Daegu, South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="209">Xintiandi believers traveling from Wuhan to Daegu are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="210">As of February 22, of the 9,336 members of the church, 1,261, or about 13%, had reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest alert level on February 23, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="211">On February 28, South Korea reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, increasing to 3,150 on February 29.</seg>
<seg id="212">Three soldiers tested positive for the virus, and all South Korean military bases have since been isolated.</seg>
<seg id="213">The flight schedule has also been adjusted due to the impact of the epidemic. South Korea has launched what is considered the largest and best-organized virus prevention and control program in the world, namely, screening a large number of people for the virus, isolating all infected people and tracking and isolating close contacts of infected people.</seg>
<seg id="214">Screening methods include making it mandatory for new entrants from abroad to report their own symptoms through mobile applications, conduct a no-drop virus test, obtain the results the next day, and improve the detection ability, which can accommodate up to 20,000 people per day.</seg>
<seg id="215">Although it did not isolate the entire city, South Korea's plan was considered a success in epidemic prevention and control. South Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude towards President Moon Jae-in's crisis response.</seg>
<seg id="216">Many South Koreans signed the petition. Some called for the impeachment of Moon Jae-in, accusing the government of mishandling the epidemic, while others praised his response strategy.</seg>
<seg id="217">On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of new cases in a single day in four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="218">On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all newly arrived overseas personnel will be isolated for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="219">According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus detection assistance from 121 different countries and regions.</seg>
<seg id="220">On February 19, Iran announced the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Qom. Later, according to the Iranian Ministry of Health, two patients died on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="221">Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events and Friday prayers, and the complete suspension of universities, higher education institutions and primary and secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="222">Iran has allocated 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="223">On February 26, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to block areas affected by the epidemic, but only to isolate infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="224">In March, Iran announced plans to restrict inter-city travel, but inter-city traffic congestion continued into the Persian New Year.</seg>
<seg id="225">Shiite shrines in the Qom region were open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. In February, Iran became a center for the spread of the virus after China.</seg>
<seg id="226">Many parties believe that the extent of the outbreak of the epidemic in Iran has been covered up, including that, as of February 28, the retrospective results of cases in more than a dozen countries pointed to Iran, which shows that the actual epidemic in Iran is more serious than the 388 cases reported by the government as of that date.</seg>
<seg id="227">The Iranian parliament was forced to close, and 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on March 3.</seg>
<seg id="228">On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prisons to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peacefully expressing dissent and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="229">The organization pointed out that the virus is at greater risk of transmission in closed institutions such as detention centers and that these institutions lack adequate health-care measures.</seg>
<seg id="230">On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest single-day death toll reported in the country since the outbreak of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="231">As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="232">As of March 23, there were 50 new confirmed cases per hour in Iran and one new case of death due to coronavirus every 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="233">According to World Health Organization officials, the actual number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than reported.</seg>
<seg id="234">There is also a view that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country's financial resources in dealing with the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="235">The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.</seg>
<seg id="236">On January 31, two Chinese tourists were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome, and the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="237">The subsequent sharp rise in the number of cases in the country prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="238">Starting with the 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on February 21, a number of unrelated COVID-19 cases were later discovered. On February 22, the Cabinet meeting announced a new decree to curb the spread of the epidemic, including the isolation of more than 50,000 people in 11 different cities in northern Italy.</seg>
<seg id="239">Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced: "Access to the affected areas is strictly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="240">The affected areas have ordered the suspension of work and sports events. On March 4, as the number of deaths in the country reached 100, the Italian government ordered the complete suspension of schools at all levels throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="241">All major sports events, including the Serie A, will be held in a spectator-free mode until April, but on March 9, all sports events have been completely suspended for at least one month.</seg>
<seg id="242">On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian Society of Anesthetic Analgesia and Severe Medicine (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on possible triage schemes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On March 19, Italy reported that 3,405 people died from the pandemic, thus surpassing China as the country with the largest number of deaths from the new coronavirus in the world.</seg>
<seg id="244">On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="245">As of April 5, Italy had a cumulative total of 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cures, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.</seg>
<seg id="246">CNN has reported that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to detect all people infected with the virus so far may be part of the reason for the high mortality rate.</seg>
<seg id="247">Britain's initial response to the virus was considered one of the most relaxed of the affected countries. It was not until 18 March 2020 that the British government began to impose various forms of social distance or large-scale isolation measures on its citizens.</seg>
<seg id="248">As a result, the British government has been criticized for its lack of speed and strength in dealing with public concerns. On March 16, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending the cancellation of any unnecessary travel and social contacts, advising people to work at home as much as possible and avoiding places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.</seg>
<seg id="249">On March 20, the government announced that all leisure places, including bars and gyms, should be closed as soon as possible and promised to bear up to 80% of workers' wages, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month, in order to prevent unemployment in the event of a crisis. On March 23, the British Prime Minister announced tougher measures to maintain social distance, prohibiting gatherings of more than two people and not engaging in any travel and outdoor activities unless absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="250">Unlike previous measures, the restrictions announced were enforced by the police through fines and the dispersal of assemblies.</seg>
<seg id="251">With the exception of supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and garages, which are considered "essential", most other businesses have been ordered to stop work.</seg>
<seg id="252">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States was found in the northwestern Pacific state of Washington on January 20, and the patient returned to the area from Wuhan on January 15.</seg>
<seg id="253">On January 29, the White House established a coronavirus task force.</seg>
<seg id="254">On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed entry restrictions on travelers from China.</seg>
<seg id="255">On January 28, 2020, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the main public health agency under the United States Government) announced that it had developed its own testing kit.</seg>
<seg id="256">Nevertheless, the start of testing in the United States was still slow, masking the real situation of the epidemic at that time.</seg>
<seg id="257">The defects in the kits produced by the federal government in February, the fact that the federal government did not approve the use of non-governmental kits (from academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the fact that the restrictive criteria for testing eligibility (requiring medical advice thereafter) were not determined until early March, all of which led to the obstruction of pre-testing in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="258">On February 27, The Washington Post reported that the total number of tests performed in the United States was less than 4,000.</seg>
<seg id="259">On March 13, The Atlantic reported that the total number of tests performed in the United States was less than 14,000.</seg>
<seg id="260">On March 22, the Associated Press reported that "many patients with symptoms and medical advice waited for hours or days to be tested". On February 29, after Washington reported the first death in the United States, Governor Jay Insley immediately declared a state of emergency, and other states soon followed suit.</seg>
<seg id="261">On March 3, schools in the Seattle area were closed. In mid-March, schools at all levels across the country were completely closed. On March 6, 2020, some epidemiologists at Imperial College London gave predictions on the impact of the new coronavirus on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronary Virus Prevention and Response Supplementary Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="263">Enterprises impose travel restrictions on employees, cancel meetings and encourage employees to work from home.</seg>
<seg id="264">Sports events and seasons were forced to be canceled. On March 11, Trump announced that he would impose a 30-day travel ban on most European countries, with the exception of the United Kingdom, from March 13.</seg>
<seg id="265">The next day, Trump extended the restrictions to include the United Kingdom and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="266">On March 13, Trump declared a national emergency and began to use federal funds to deal with the epidemic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="267">Since March 15, many enterprises across the United States have closed or shortened their business hours in an effort to ease the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">As of March 17, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had reported confirmed cases. On March 23, it was reported that the number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in New York City reached 10,700, exceeding the total number of cases in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="269">On March 25, the governor of New York said that maintaining social distance seemed to have begun to work, and the estimated doubling interval between cases was extended from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.</seg>
<seg id="270">As of March 28, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in New York City had reached 32,308 and 672 deaths due to the virus. On March 26, it was reported that the number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus infection in the United States exceeded that of any other country, including China and Italy. As of April 8, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the United States had reached 400,335 and 12,841 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="271">According to media reports on March 30, US President Donald Trump decided to extend the implementation of the social distance rule until April 30.</seg>
<seg id="272">On the same day, the medical ship comfort, with a total of about 1,000 beds, broke down in New York.</seg>
<seg id="273">On April 3, there were 884 new cases of coronavirus deaths in the United States in 24 hours, a record high.</seg>
<seg id="274">On April 3, the total number of cases in New York State exceeded 100,000. The White House instructed health officials and scientists to coordinate virus-related public statements and publications with Vice President Mike Pence's office in order to downplay the threat and control the transmission of information, a move criticized by the public.</seg>
<seg id="275">The public's overall approval of Trump's crisis prevention and control measures has been polarized by partisan differences.</seg>
<seg id="276">Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized the United States for relying on imports of essential medical supplies and other critical materials from China.</seg>
<seg id="277">The analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict transmission patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="278">According to information released by the International Air Transport Association in 2018, the largest number of passengers traveled from Wuhan to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei.</seg>
<seg id="279">It is also reported that Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne are also popular destinations for travelers from Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="280">It is reported that of the 20 most popular destination cities, Bali is the least prepared and Australian cities are the best prepared. Australia released a new coronavirus (COVID-19) contingency plan on February 7.</seg>
<seg id="281">The report points out that people do not know enough about COVID-19 and that Australia will focus on border control and communication in dealing with the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="282">On March 21, Australia declared a "human biosafety emergency".</seg>
<seg id="283">Due to the effective isolation of public transport in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei, some countries and regions have planned to withdraw their citizens and diplomats living in these areas to their home countries, mainly through domestic charter flights and permission provided by the relevant Chinese authorities.</seg>
<seg id="284">Among the first countries to plan to evacuate are Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="285">Pakistan says it will not evacuate its nationals from China.</seg>
<seg id="286">On February 7, Brazil withdrew 34 Brazilians or family members, as well as four Poles, one Chinese and one Indian.</seg>
<seg id="287">The Brazilian plane passed through Poland and made a short stop before flying to Brazil, where citizens of Poland, China and India got off the plane.</seg>
<seg id="288">Brazilian citizens who had been to Wuhan were sent to a military base near Brasilia for isolation.</seg>
<seg id="289">On the same day, 215 Canadians (of whom 176 were withdrawn from the first aircraft and 39 from the second aircraft chartered by the United States Government) were withdrawn from Wuhan and sent to the Canadian military base in Trenton for a two-week isolation.</seg>
<seg id="290">On February 11, another plane carrying 185 Canadians took off from Wuhan and landed at the Canadian military base in Trenton.</seg>
<seg id="291">On February 3 and 4, the Australian authorities withdrew 277 citizens and sent them to the Christmas Island Detention Centre, which has been converted into a place of isolation, for a period of 14 days of isolation.</seg>
<seg id="292">A New Zealand evacuation plane landed in Auckland on February 5; the passengers on board, including some from Australia and the Pacific, were taken to a naval base north of Auckland for isolation.</seg>
<seg id="293">On February 15, the United States announced the withdrawal of the Americans on board the cruise ship Princess Diamond.</seg>
<seg id="294">On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers landed in Trenton, Ontario, the passengers who were withdrawn from the cruise ship Princess Diamond.</seg>
<seg id="295">In early March, the Indian government began to evacuate overseas Chinese from Iran. On March 14, the South African government chartered a South African Airlines plane to evacuate 112 South African citizens.</seg>
<seg id="296">Passengers were medically screened before the plane took off, and four South Africans who showed signs of a new coronavirus were left behind to reduce the risk of transmission.</seg>
<seg id="297">Only South Africans whose test results were negative were withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="298">All South Africans (including crew members, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in humanitarian missions) tested negative and were sent to The Ranch Resort for 14 days of observation and isolation as a precautionary measure.</seg>
<seg id="299">On March 20, affected by the epidemic, the United States began to withdraw some of its troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="300">On February 5, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had provided assistance to China.</seg>
<seg id="301">Some Chinese students attending universities in the United States have also joined forces to help deliver relief supplies to areas hit by the virus in China. It is reported that a joint team from the Greater Chicago area delivered 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei Province on January 30. The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, delivered 200,000 masks and other personal protective equipment, including gloves and protective clothing, to Wuhan Union Hospital by emergency airlift by January 30.</seg>
<seg id="302">On February 5, Mr. and Mrs. Gates announced that they would donate $100 million to the World Health Organization to fund vaccine research and development and treatment, while protecting "high-risk populations in Africa and South Asia".</seg>
<seg id="303">According to Interaksyon, the Chinese government donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6 after Philippine Senator Richard Gordon delivered 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="304">On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross Society announced that it would provide US$2.26 million worth of assistance to China.</seg>
<seg id="305">Japan has donated 1 million masks to Wuhan, and Turkey has distributed medical equipment to Wuhan. Russia has delivered more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, and Malaysia has announced the donation of 18 million pairs of medical gloves to China. Germany has delivered 10,000 sets of protective clothing and other medical materials to China. The United States has donated 17.8 tons of medical materials to China and pledged to provide an additional US$100 million in financial support to the affected countries and regions. After the cases in China appear to have stabilized, China has also been providing assistance to other countries and regions affected by the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="306">In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent experts and medical supplies to Italy to help it cope with the new coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="307">Entrepreneur Ma Yun delivered 1.1 million kits, 6 million masks and 60,000 protective clothing to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to be distributed by the African Union.</seg>
<seg id="308">Ma Yun later delivered 5,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and five ventilators to Panama.</seg>
<seg id="309">In addition, Ma Yun donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about Chinese-made masks and kits.</seg>
<seg id="310">For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus detection kits with an accuracy of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese masks.</seg>
<seg id="311">Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, believed to be from China but actually from Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the other hand, China's assistance is widely welcomed in Latin America and parts of Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="313">The World Health Organization praised the efforts made by the Chinese authorities in the prevention and control of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="314">The World Health Organization has noted the contrast between the SARS epidemic in 2002-2004 and the current crisis. In the SARS epidemic, the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing the facts, impeding prevention and containment efforts. In the current crisis, the central government "began to update the situation regularly before the Lunar New Year holiday in order to avoid panic".</seg>
<seg id="315">On January 23, in response to the decision of the central government to implement the closure measures for Wuhan, Gao Li, a representative of the World Health Organization, said that although this was "certainly not a proposal put forward by the World Health Organization", it also "fully reflects the determination to curb the spread of the epidemic from the areas where the epidemic is most concentrated". He called the move "unprecedented in the history of public health". On January 30, human-to-human transmission was confirmed outside China and the number of cases in other countries increased. The World Health Organization immediately announced that the outbreak constituted an international public health emergency (PHEIC). This is the sixth public health emergency of international concern since the measure was first implemented during the swine flu pandemic in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tan Desai, pointed out that the determination of public health emergencies of international concern is based on "the risk of global transmission, especially to low-and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems".</seg>
<seg id="317">In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tandesser said that "there is no reason to take measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the World Trade Organization does not recommend restricting trade and movement".</seg>
<seg id="318">On February 5, the World Health Organization appealed to the international community to contribute US$675 million to fund the strategic readiness of low-income countries, saying that there is an urgent need to support countries that "do not have supporting systems to test people infected with the virus".</seg>
<seg id="319">Tandesser further issued a statement, declaring that "the weakest link determines how strong we are" and urging the international community to "invest immediately or the cost will be greater in the future". On February 11, the World Health Organization confirmed at a press conference that the disease would be named COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the same day, Tan Desai said that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed that "the United Nations will make every effort to deal with the epidemic".</seg>
<seg id="321">To this end, the United Nations launched the United Nations Crisis Management Group to coordinate the response of the entire United Nations. The World Health Organization said that this would enable the WHO to "focus on the health response, while other agencies could also use their expertise to deal with the broader social, economic and development impact of the epidemic".</seg>
<seg id="322">On February 14, a joint mission of China led by the World Health Organization was launched to send international and World Health Organization experts to China on the ground to help deal with the local epidemic and assess the "seriousness and infectiousness of the disease" by holding seminars and meeting with important institutions at the national level. And through field visits to assess "the impact of provincial and county-level response activities, including the different situations in urban and rural areas". On February 25, the World Health Organization announced that "the world should make greater efforts to fully prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic". It also pointed out that although it is too early to call it a pandemic, countries should still "enter a state of readiness".</seg>
<seg id="323">In response to the growing epidemic in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation. On February 28, World Health Organization officials said that the global risk level of the coronavirus epidemic had been raised from "high" to "very high", which is also the highest alert and risk level of the assessment method.</seg>
<seg id="324">Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergency Response Project, warned in a statement: "This is a reality check for governments around the world: wake up.</seg>
<seg id="325">The virus may be approaching, please be prepared" and urge governments to take the right response measures to avoid a "worst-case scenario" around the world.</seg>
<seg id="326">Ryan further pointed out that the current data is not enough for public health officials to declare a global pandemic. Such a declaration would mean that "we basically recognize that everyone on Earth may be exposed to the virus."</seg>
<seg id="327">On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that the new coronavirus outbreak constituted a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="328">The Director-General of the World Health Organization said he was "deeply concerned about the thought-provoking spread and severity and the reality of inaction". The World Health Organization has been severely criticized for its perceived mishandling of the global pandemic, including delaying the announcement of public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="329">Strong opposition included a petition asking Tedros Adhanom, Director-General of the World Health Organization, to submit his resignation. As of April 6, 733,000 people had signed the petition.</seg>
<seg id="330">On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the need to respect the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="331">The expert group pointed out that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the government should assume this responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="332">The expert group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be a reason to discriminate against specific groups.</seg>
<seg id="333">Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, groups living in extremely poor conditions, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.</seg>
<seg id="334">International governmental organizations are actively responding to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</seg>
<seg id="335">The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform aimed at providing timely and comprehensive information, views and suggestions on the policy responses of countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="336">From policies to strengthen the health system and the world economy to dealing with the impact of the embargo and travel restrictions, this digital center has a national policy tracking system, which aims to help countries learn from each other and promote global cooperation to meet the challenge of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="337">As the pandemic first broke out in Hubei Province, China, Michael Gove, Secretary of the Cabinet Office of the United States and the United Kingdom, and Eduardo Bosonaro, son of Brazilian President Yair Bosonaro, criticized the Chinese government's handling.</seg>
<seg id="338">Several provincial administrative officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for improper handling of epidemic prevention work in central China, reflecting the central government's dissatisfaction with the epidemic response measures of local political institutions.</seg>
<seg id="339">Some commentators believe that the move is aimed at avoiding public dissatisfaction with Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, as a result of the outbreak of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="340">Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, denied the previously admitted statement that the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan and supported the conspiracy theory that the new coronavirus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.</seg>
<seg id="341">US President Donald Trump once referred to the new coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China's "censorship system has exacerbated the spread of the virus and turned it into the current global pandemic", which in turn has been considered by some critics to be a form of racial discrimination and "diverted attention from the failure of its government to contain the virus".</seg>
<seg id="342">The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining a communications strategy apparently issued by the National Security Council, which stated that "all this has nothing to do with China.</seg>
<seg id="343">We were told to disseminate this information as much as possible by any means, including press conferences and television appearances. Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claimed that China's assistance to the affected countries was to promote its global influence.</seg>
<seg id="344">Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, warned that there was a "geopolitical factor that includes competing for influence through good offices and "generous politics."</seg>
<seg id="345">"China is vigorously promoting that it is a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States," Borrel said.</seg>
<seg id="346">China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and has allegedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.</seg>
<seg id="347">On April 3, the 100,000 masks donated by Ma Yun to Cuba were blocked by U.S. sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="348">The United States authorities have also been accused of transferring aid sent to other countries to their own countries.</seg>
<seg id="349">It is reported that there are also mask disputes between Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as other countries such as the Czech Republic and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="350">In addition, Turkey intercepted hundreds of breathing machines destined for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="351">In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union for insufficient support for Italy affected by the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="352">Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said: "Only China has made a bilateral response.</seg>
<seg id="353">Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."</seg>
<seg id="354">On March 22, after talking to Italian Prime Minister Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Italian newspaper Izvestia quoted an anonymous "high-ranking political official" as saying that 80% of Russia's aid "is of little use to Italy".</seg>
<seg id="356">The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm offensive.</seg>
<seg id="357">The mayor of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="358">Russia has also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="359">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "[Putin], in providing assistance to his American colleagues, believes that once American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials resume production capacity, they will pay back if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="360">The planned NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea is the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War. The scale of the exercise will be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="361">Kate Hudson, secretary-general of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the "Defender 2020" exercise: "At a time when the world is facing a public health crisis, the exercise not only endangers the lives of military personnel in the United States and many European participating countries, but also endangers the residents of the countries where the exercise is held." The Iranian government has been seriously affected by the epidemic, in which about 24 parliamentarians and 15 other current or former politicians have been infected.</seg>
<seg id="362">On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance. The letter pointed out that the sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran have prevented Iran from entering the international market, making it difficult for Iran to combat the epidemic. The outbreak of the epidemic has prompted all parties to call on the United States to adopt the social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child health care, paid family visit leave and raising the level of public health funds.</seg>
<seg id="363">Political analysts predict that the outbreak could have a negative impact on whether Donald Trump can be re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated as a result of the global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="364">Japan announced that all people entering from South Korea would be subject to a two-week quarantine at a government-designated location. South Korea later criticized Japan's "vague and passive quarantine measures".</seg>
<seg id="365">South Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude towards President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="366">Many South Koreans signed the petition, some calling for the impeachment of Moon Jae-in, accusing the government of mishandling the epidemic, while others praised his response strategy. The pandemic prompted many countries to pass emergency legislation in response.</seg>
<seg id="367">Some commentators worry that this could lead the government to tighten its grip on power.</seg>
<seg id="368">In Hungary, parliament voted for Prime Minister Orban Viktor to rule indefinitely by decree, suspending parliament and elections, and punishing anyone found to have disseminated false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="369">The multifaceted supply shortage can be attributed to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which stems from the increased use of equipment, panic shopping and the disruption of factory and logistics operations around the world to combat the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="370">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.</seg>
<seg id="371">Panic shopping has occurred in many places, leading to the emptying of necessities such as food, toilet paper and bottled water on the shelves, resulting in a shortage of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="372">In particular, the technology industry has been warning of delays in the delivery of electronic products.</seg>
<seg id="373">According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tan Desai, the public's demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.</seg>
<seg id="374">This demand has led to a 20-fold increase in the price of such products over the usual peak, and a delay of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.</seg>
<seg id="375">It has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which the World Health Organization has warned will pose a threat to medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="376">In Australia, the pandemic has provided buyers with new opportunities to sell Australian products to China.</seg>
<seg id="377">The campaign led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets, which was immediately banned by the Australian government. Although COVID-19 in northern Italy and Wuhan is very serious, there is no serious food shortage in these two places.</seg>
<seg id="378">The measures taken by China and Italy against the hoarding and illegal trade of key products have been very successful, avoiding serious food shortages, while such problems are expected in Europe and North America.</seg>
<seg id="379">Agricultural production in northern Italy has not fallen sharply, but industry representatives believe that prices may rise.</seg>
<seg id="380">The phenomenon of emptying food shelves is only temporary, even in Wuhan. Chinese government officials have also released pork reserves to ensure adequate nutrition for residents.</seg>
<seg id="381">Italy has similar legal provisions requiring food producers to reserve supplies for such emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="382">The damage to the global economy has had an impact on China: A media report on March 16 said that in the first two months of 2020, under the influence of the epidemic containment measures taken by the government, China's economy suffered a huge impact, with retail sales plummeting by 20.5%.</seg>
<seg id="383">As mainland China is the world's main economic and manufacturing center, the outbreak of the virus is seen as a major threat to the stability of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="384">According to Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit, the market will remain unstable until there is a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.</seg>
<seg id="385">In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth could exceed that of the SARS epidemic in 2002-2004.</seg>
<seg id="386">An expert from Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the impact of the epidemic on global supply chains will amount to more than $300 billion, which may last for up to two years.</seg>
<seg id="387">It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is "in a difficult position" after the sharp fall in oil prices due to the decline in Chinese demand.</seg>
<seg id="388">On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.</seg>
<seg id="389">On February 27, due to the growing concern of the public about the new coronavirus epidemic, all kinds of US stock indexes, including the Nasdaq 100 Index, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, all experienced the largest decline since 2008. The Dow fell 1,191 points, the largest one-day decline since the financial crisis of 2007-08.</seg>
<seg id="390">All three indexes fell more than 10% in the week.</seg>
<seg id="391">On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.</seg>
<seg id="392">Public concerns about the new coronavirus caused the stock market to plummet again, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many people believe that the recession is a high probability event.</seg>
<seg id="394">Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised central banks and states for taking timely emergency measures.</seg>
<seg id="395">Compared with the 2008 financial crisis, the central bank reacted more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="396">Affected by the travel ban, the closure of public places such as tourist attractions and the advice of governments to avoid travel, tourism has become one of the most affected industries.</seg>
<seg id="397">As a result, many airlines canceled flights due to declining demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Australia Airlines, while British branch airline Flybe collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="398">The cruise industry has been hit harder than ever.</seg>
<seg id="399">Several railway stations and ferry ports were also forced to close.</seg>
<seg id="400">The epidemic coincided with the Spring Festival, which was originally an important tourist season due to the Chinese Spring Festival holiday.</seg>
<seg id="401">National and local governments have canceled a series of activities involving crowd gatherings, including the annual Spring Festival, and private enterprises have closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.</seg>
<seg id="402">Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions, including the Beijing Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs, have been canceled and closed to prevent large-scale crowds from gathering.</seg>
<seg id="403">Of China's 31 provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government and autonomous regions, 24 regions have extended the New Year holiday to February 10, requiring most enterprises not to resume work before that date.</seg>
<seg id="404">These regions account for 80 percent of the country's GDP and 90 percent of exports.</seg>
<seg id="405">Hong Kong, China, raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency. Schools were closed until March and New Year celebrations were canceled. The retail industry was affected globally, and shops were shortened or temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Retail store patronage in Europe and Latin America fell by 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="407">Retail store patronage in North America and the Middle East fell by 50-60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="408">In addition, the epidemic also led to a 33-43% drop in passenger traffic in shopping centers in March compared with February.</seg>
<seg id="409">Shopping center operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as increasing sanitary facilities, installing heat scanners to measure shoppers' body temperature and canceling some activities. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the economic recession caused by the pandemic could lead to between 14 million and 22 million more people living in extreme poverty in Latin America than in the absence of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="410">In January and February 2020, at the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.</seg>
<seg id="411">China has nearly 300 million migrant workers, many of whom are stranded in their homes in inland provinces or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.</seg>
<seg id="412">According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the new coronavirus epidemic could cause 47 million people in the United States to lose their jobs and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The blockade in India has caused tens of millions of (daily-paid) Indian migrant workers to lose their jobs. A survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some form of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs since the blockade was imposed in Spain in mid-March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal benefits. Nearly half a million German companies adopted a government-subsidized reduced-time work system for their employees.</seg>
<seg id="414">Both France and the United Kingdom have also adopted the German compensation system for reduced-time work.</seg>
<seg id="415">The performing arts and cultural industries have also been hard hit by the epidemic, and organizations around the world, as well as employed employees and individuals, have not been spared.</seg>
<seg id="416">Arts and cultural industry organizations strive to uphold their mission (usually funded by the government), display cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and provide support to artists to the extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="417">By March 2020, museums, libraries, performing arts venues and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and scheduled exhibitions, events and performances have been canceled or postponed.</seg>
<seg id="418">To deal with this situation, all parties have begun to make great efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The epidemic will also lead to the cancellation of many religious services, major sports activities and other social activities (such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows) in the near future, and this negative impact will intensify rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="419">The film industry has also been hit. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week commemoration to be held in Rome in the last week of Lent.</seg>
<seg id="420">Many parishes advise older Christians to stay at home and not attend mass on Sundays; some churches hold services on radio, live online or television, while others allow worship in cars.</seg>
<seg id="421">As the Roman Catholic district closed its large and small churches, there were no Christian pilgrims in St. Peter's Square, and other religious groups canceled or restricted worship or limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and teachers' houses.</seg>
<seg id="422">Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic. Prayer shrines were later forced to close, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.</seg>
<seg id="423">The pandemic has caused the worst damage to the world sports agenda since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="424">Most major sporting events have been canceled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 National Hockey Federation season.</seg>
<seg id="425">The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to be held at the end of July. The International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gambling venues around the world have been closed, and live poker competitions have been forced to be postponed or canceled.</seg>
<seg id="426">This, in turn, has led many gamblers to turn to online gambling. Several online gambling websites have reported a significant increase in their new registration rate. The entertainment industry has also been affected, and various music groups have suspended or canceled their tours.</seg>
<seg id="427">Many large theaters, such as the Broadway Theatre, have also suspended all performances.</seg>
<seg id="428">Some artists have also managed to continue to create and share works through the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as live concerts, or to create online "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works.</seg>
<seg id="429">On the Internet, many Internet memes with the theme of the new coronavirus have spread. At a time when uncertainty is spreading, many people are turning to dealing with it in a humorous and distracting manner.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudice, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asians and people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries have intensified.</seg>
<seg id="431">Many countries and regions, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have experienced incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred.</seg>
<seg id="432">Many reports in February this year, when most cases were still limited to China, documented the racist feelings of different groups around the world towards the Chinese, believing that the Chinese should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate reprisals.</seg>
<seg id="433">Some African countries have also seen a rise in anti-China sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="434">It is reported that many residents in Wuhan and Hubei have been subjected to geographical discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="435">Both online and online, there are voices supporting the Chinese and residents of areas with severe epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="436">As the epidemic spread to other hotspot countries, Italy became the first country in Europe to have a serious outbreak of COVID-19, and people from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and other countries initially signed a petition requesting that Chinese people be banned from entering the country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="437">In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese Don't Come to Japan) topic launched on Twitter has been widely disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="438">Chinese and other Asians in Britain and the United States have reported increasing racial abuse and attacks.</seg>

<seg id="441">It is reported that students from northeastern India (bordering China) and studying in major Indian cities have also been harassed by the outbreak of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="442">Dilip Gosh, chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature, "so God will retaliate against them."</seg>
<seg id="443">These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as "wrong". In China, the xenophobia and racial discrimination suffered by non-Chinese residents have also been exacerbated by the pandemic. Foreigners have been described as "foreign garbage" and should be the target of "garbage disposal".</seg>
<seg id="444">Many newspapers with paywalls have removed paywall restrictions for some or all of their coverage of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="445">Many scientific publishers have publicly published some scientific papers related to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="446">Other scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.</seg>

<seg id="1">B Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-evaluation, redistribution or treatment conversion) refers to the conversion of an approved drug to other uses to treat a disease or medical condition different from its original research and development purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is currently a scientific research route for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment method.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and recovery plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be used in pharmaceuticals, each with multiple ligand binding sites.</seg>
<seg id="4">The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable scheme for the development of effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 protein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papain, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribose diphosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hussein A A et al. Studied several candidate compounds and then optimized and analyzed the skeleton similarity of these candidate compounds against the approved drugs with the highest degree of similarity in order to accelerate the development of effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in their preclinical trials and recommend them in clinical research design.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug and is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.</seg>
<seg id="8">On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that four drugs, including chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine, would be studied as part of the solidarity clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="9">New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine trials in New York will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA's clinical trial procedure, but only by EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use by patients who have been hospitalized but are unable to receive treatment in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "the use, dose or timing of hydroxychloroquine used to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been determined.</seg>
<seg id="12">Doctors say they use the drug when they have "no choice."</seg>
<seg id="13">A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.</seg>
<seg id="14">Duke University and Oxford University are conducting large-scale research.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Langney School of Medicine at New York University is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="16">China's clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen said that Fabiravir was "obviously effective".</seg>
<seg id="17">In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within an average of four days, while 45 patients who did not receive the drug had a course of 11 days.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half received Fabiravir and the other half received Abidol.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Italian Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authority reminded the public that the available evidence in support of the drug was insufficient and preliminary.</seg>
<seg id="20">On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan as a reserve and use the military to transport the drug to university hospitals to use the drug to treat COVID-19 patients in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made a proposal to the Trump administration to buy the drug. The efficacy of the drug may be reduced in seriously ill patients where the virus has been reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="22">It may be unsafe for pregnant women or people preparing for pregnancy to use the drug.</seg>
<seg id="23">A study of lopinavir/Kaletra (a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir) concluded that "no benefits have been observed".</seg>
<seg id="24">These drugs are designed to inhibit the replication of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) by binding to proteases.</seg>
<seg id="25">A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find compounds that bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteases. The scientific community has criticized the use of resources to reuse drugs developed specifically for HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="26">The World Health Organization has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity experiment.</seg>
<seg id="27">Redsive is a drug created and developed by Gilead Science to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Science subsequently found that Redsive has antiviral activity against a variety of filamentous viruses, pneumonia virus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="28">One problem with antiviral therapy is that drug resistance through mutations can lead to more serious diseases and transmission.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some early pre-trial studies have shown that Redsive may have a high genetic barrier to drug resistance. A number of clinical trials are under way, two of which are conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for patients with moderate symptoms and the other for patients with more severe symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="30">At present, three clinical trials of vitamin C intravenous injection for COVID-19 hospitalized seriously ill patients are under way; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one non-controlled trial (Italy).</seg>

<seg id="34">Researchers at the Institute of Cardiology in Montreal, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with COVID-19 mild disease.</seg>
<seg id="35">The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="36">Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding or who do not take effective contraceptive measures are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="37">Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Low molecular weight heparin is widely used in the treatment of patients, which prompted the Italian Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency to issue guidelines for its use.</seg>
<seg id="39">On April 14, Italy announced a multi-center study of 300 patients to study the application of preventive and therapeutic doses of heparin sodium.</seg>
<seg id="40">As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the re-use of approved antiviral drugs has attracted considerable scientific attention. These drugs have been developed for previous outbreaks of diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and West Nile virus.</seg>
<seg id="41">Libavirin: According to the seventh edition of China's guidelines, the use of Libavirin in the treatment of COVID-19 is recommended</seg>
<seg id="42">Abidol hydrochloride: According to the seventh edition of China's guidelines, the use of Abidol hydrochloride in the treatment of COVID-19 is recommended</seg>
<seg id="43">Some potential reusable antibiotics that have been identified for use in COVID-19 treatment:</seg>
<seg id="44">Toad monoclonal antibody (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.</seg>
<seg id="45">Relevant experiments have also been carried out in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab #COVID-19.</seg>

<seg id="1">COVID-19 workplace prevention and control</seg>
<seg id="2">COVID-19 workplace prevention and control refers to the use of occupational safety and health measures to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">The appropriateness of workplace hazard prevention and control depends on the specific work site and work task, and should be determined on the basis of the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of vulnerable individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues, so it is recommended to take basic infection prevention measures, including washing hands frequently, encouraging employees to be isolated at home after illness, observing respiratory etiquette and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Medium-exposure work includes work that requires regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, who may be infected as a result of continuous community transmission or international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This includes staff who come into contact with the general public, such as schools, high-density work environments and some large-scale retail environments.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should also use high-efficiency air filters and sneezing protective devices for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment and take other risk prevention and control measures when in contact with COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA believes that there is a high risk of exposure to medical personnel and mortuary staff who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. If staff perform aerosol-producing operations on known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process specimens from them, the risk of exposure becomes extremely high.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hazard prevention and control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The outbreak of COVID-19 could have a serious impact on the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Staff may be absent from work due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="12">Business models may also change, including changes in demand for goods or changes in access to these goods (such as shopping during off-peak hours or using distribution or drop-off delivery services).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, product logistics from areas with severe COVID-19 epidemics may be disrupted. Infectious disease prevention and response plans can be used to guide protection actions.</seg>
<seg id="14">These plans address the level of risk associated with various workplaces and work tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors from the family and community environment and risk factors for individual workers, such as the elderly or groups with chronic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="15">These plans also outline the prevention and control measures needed to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to be subject to national or local recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goals of responding to the outbreak include reducing inter-employee transmission, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the response will also be affected by the severity of the disease in the community in which the enterprise is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hazard prevention and control level is a widely used prevention and control framework in occupational safety and health. It is used to group hazard prevention and control measures according to their effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the hazards of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering control refers to isolating employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on employees' behavior for control, which is also the least costly solution to implement.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative control refers to changing work policies or procedures and requiring staff or employers to take action on their own.</seg>
<seg id="23">The prevention and control effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) is lower than that of engineering control and administrative control, but it helps to prevent some exposure.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of PPE should be selected according to the level of risk faced by the staff, equipped according to the applicable circumstances (such as respirators), and must always be worn correctly, regularly inspected and maintained, replaced if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid pollution.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is recommended that all workplaces should take basic infection prevention measures, including washing hands frequently, advising sick employees to be isolated at home, abide by breathing etiquette when coughing or sneezing, provide paper towels and garbage cans, be prepared to work remotely, commute to and from work at the wrong peak if necessary, dissuade employees from using the tools and equipment of others, and keep the workplace clean and disinfected on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="27">Identifying and isolating potentially infectious individuals in a timely manner is the key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.</seg>
<seg id="28">The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who show acute respiratory symptoms should be isolated at home for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there are no fever, fever signs and any other symptoms, that the sick leave policy should be implemented flexibly, that employees should be allowed to take care of sick family members at home, and that employees should be clearly informed of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk work includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within a range of 6 feet (1.8 m), but may cause an individual to contract SARS-CoV-2 as a result of continuous community transmission near the workplace or as a result of a possible recent visit to the COVID-19 epidemic area.</seg>
<seg id="30">Such staff include staff working in schools, high population density working environments and some mass retail environments who will come into contact with the general public. Engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of efficient air filters, improve ventilation, install physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing protection devices and install drop-free windows to provide customer service. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging sick employees to be isolated at home, replace face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establish a staggered shift system, cancel non-essential travel to the COVID-19 outbreak site, formulate an emergency communication plan, including a forum to answer staff questions, and provide staff with the latest education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behavior, provide training to staff who need to use protective clothing and protective equipment in the use of protective clothing and protective equipment, provide resources and working environment conducive to improving personal hygiene, require frequent hand washing, restrict customers and the public from entering the work site, and post signs on hand washing and other COVID-19 protective measures. According to specific work tasks, at a minimum, staff at risk of moderate exposure should be equipped with personal protective equipment, including gloves, robes, masks or goggles.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is advisable for such staff to be equipped with respirators.</seg>
<seg id="32">If someone falls ill on the plane, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including arranging the patient to a distance of 6 feet from other passengers, designating a crew member to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask, or requiring the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick travelers, touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces. If sick travelers have symptoms such as fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing, crew members should also wear additional personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="34">Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag and the contaminated surface should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk prevention and control measures also include postponing travel in the event of illness. If there is fever or other symptoms on board the ship, self-isolation should be carried out and the medical room on board should be notified immediately.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the compartment of the segregated person. For schools and childcare places, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if the infected person has been present in the school, the corresponding schools and childcare places should be closed for a short period of time for thorough cleaning or disinfection, regardless of the spread of the community.</seg>
<seg id="36">For medium-and low-level community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling other large gatherings such as field visits, rallies and physical education classes, chorus classes or cafeteria meals, increasing the distance between desks, arriving and leaving at the wrong peaks, limiting the visits of non-essential visitors, and arranging separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="37">If community transmission is serious, in addition to implementing a social distance strategy, consideration may also be given to extending the suspension time. For law enforcement personnel carrying out daily routine activities, the CDC considers that they face a lower direct health risk.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who must come into contact with COVID-19 confirmed patients or suspected individuals should act in accordance with the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the event of close contact during the arrest, staff members should first clean and disinfect their service belts and equipment before cleaning them with household cleaning spray or rags, and should comply with standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures and clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA believes that some health care and mortuary workers face a high or very high risk of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="41">Staff at high risk of exposure include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff who actually come into contact with people known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">If staff perform droplet generation procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or process specimens of infected or suspected infected persons, the risk of exposure becomes extremely high.</seg>
<seg id="43">Droplet generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or body cavity specimen collection.</seg>
<seg id="44">The staff of the high-exposure morgue includes staff involved in the collation of the bodies of the deceased, who were diagnosed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during their lifetime. If an autopsy is performed, they face a higher risk of exposure. Additional engineering measures to be taken for this risk group also include isolation rooms prepared for the diagnosis or suspected cases of COVID-19, including when performing droplet generation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Some health care facilities and morgues can also be equipped with special negative pressure ventilation systems.</seg>
<seg id="46">Biosafety level 3 precautions should be taken when handling specimens.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that different waiting areas be designated for patients according to whether the patient is a suspected case of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration also recommends that personnel working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as those performing droplet generation procedures, wear respirators.</seg>
<seg id="48">The United States requires that N95 filter masks or better masks approved by the NIOSH must be used in a comprehensive written respiratory protection program environment such as health testing, training and medical examination.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve the comfort of staff. The WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not transmitted through body fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">The WHO recommends that screening personnel at entry points simply wear a medical surgical mask.</seg>
<seg id="51">For staff who need to collect respiratory specimens from patients with COVID-19 and provide care or transfer services to patients without having to perform droplet generation procedures, the WHO recommends the use of medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">If the droplet generation procedure is to be performed, the medical surgical mask must be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 mask.</seg>
<seg id="53">In view of the inadequate global supply of personal protective equipment, the WHO recommends reducing the demand for personal protective equipment through measures such as telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only direct caregivers to enter the rooms of patients with COVID-19, using personal protective equipment only when it is really necessary for a particular task, continuing to use the same respirator when caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the personal protective equipment supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic personnel.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle pain, diarrhea, pharynx pain, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incubation period from contact with the patient to the onset of the disease ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although most cases have mild symptoms, some cases develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of April 17, 2020, a total of more than 2.24 million cases and more than 153,000 deaths had been reported in 210 countries and regions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, more than 568,000 people have recovered from treatment. The virus is mainly transmitted from person to person through close contact, often through droplets produced during coughing, sneezing or speaking.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although exhalation produces droplets, they usually fall to the ground or the surface of various objects and do not cause long-range transmission.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, if someone touches a surface contaminated with the virus and then touches their eyes, nose and mouth, they may also be infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virus can survive on the surface of an object for up to 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although it may also spread in the early stage of the disease and the late stage of recovery, it is the most infectious in the first three days of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is to detect the real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs.</seg>
<seg id="12">People suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="13">The recommendations for the public to wear masks vary from place to place. Some authorities oppose wearing masks, while others require wearing masks.</seg>
<seg id="14">At present, there is no COVID-19 vaccine or special antiviral treatment program.</seg>
<seg id="15">The vast majority of countries in all six WHO regions have reported the existence of local transmission of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or may have suspected flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="17">Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or chest tightness, blurred consciousness, difficulty waking up and blue face or lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.</seg>
<seg id="18">A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.</seg>
<seg id="19">Different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, were also monitored.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some Chinese cases initially showed only chest tightness and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure, or even death.</seg>
<seg id="22">We call this the incubation period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">97.5% Of infected people will develop symptoms within 11.5 days after infection. The report points out that not all infected people will develop symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of asymptomatic infected persons in the spread of the epidemic has not yet been fully clarified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that asymptomatic infected persons may contribute to the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="26">At present, the proportion of asymptomatic infections has not been determined and research is still being intensified. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases did not show any symptoms during hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since April 1, China's National Health and Health Commission has included asymptomatic cases in its daily circular; of the 166 infected persons on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when tested.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both sputum and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="29">Talking loudly sprays more droplets than talking normally.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore found that unstoppable coughing can cause droplets to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">Although such viruses are generally not transmitted through air, the National Academy of Sciences has determined that they may be transmitted through biological aerosols, and air collectors in the corridor outside the ward have detected positive samples of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may atomize respiratory secretions, leading to air transmission.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but this risk is considered low. When patients develop symptoms, the virus is the most infectious; although it may spread before symptoms occur, the risk is low.</seg>
<seg id="34">The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although the transmission power of the new crown virus is not completely clear, the average person can infect 2-3 people. The survival time of the virus on the surface of an object ranges from a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specifically, the new crown virus is known to survive for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% pure copper products.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">If used correctly, soap and detergent can also have the effect of killing the virus. Soap products can degrade the fat protective layer of the virus and make it inactive, while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China, showed that saliva samples were collected on average two days after admission.</seg>
<seg id="39">Five out of six patients had the highest viral load in the first sample, and one out of six patients detected the highest viral load the next day.</seg>
<seg id="40">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronary Virus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronary Virus. It was first isolated from three pneumonia patients in a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronavirus in nature.</seg>
<seg id="42">Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with household soap because soap can destroy the protective capsule of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has the highest concentration in the lung's type II alveolar cells.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus binds to ACE2 and enters the host cell through a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (cystic particle).</seg>
<seg id="45">Of the patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, 12% of those infected found acute myocardial injury, with a high proportion of seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="46">The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders caused by the worsening process of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptor of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">The ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in the heart and is involved in regulating heart function.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is reported that the incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) in patients with COVID-19 infection under the supervision of the ICU is high and may be related to poor prognosis. The autopsy of patients with COVID-19 death found diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) and inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although SARS-COV-2 is addictive to respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 can experience excessive systemic inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, the pathogenic GM-CSF secreted T cells in patients with COVID-19 are related to the collection of inflammatory IL-6 secretory monocytes and severe lung pathology.</seg>
<seg id="51">The autopsy report also showed lymphocyte infiltration.</seg>
<seg id="52">The WHO has published several disease detection programs.</seg>
<seg id="53">The standard detection method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="54">This test usually tests respiratory samples obtained through nasopharyngeal swabs; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">In general, results can be obtained in a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests can also be carried out, but it is required that two blood samples be collected at intervals of two weeks, and the results are of little immediate value.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish gene sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection reagents to detect whether they are infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of April 4, 2020, antibody detection (which can detect not only active infections, but also whether individuals have been infected with the virus in the past) is still under development, but has not yet been widely used.</seg>
<seg id="59">According to China's experience, the detection accuracy is only 60% to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">On March 21, 2020, the US FDA approved the first real-time diagnostic reagent and put it into use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University propose methods to detect infection according to clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.</seg>
<seg id="61">Early infection is often seen in double lung multi-leaf grinding glass shadow, with peripheral asymmetry and posterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="62">With the development of the virus, there may be subpleural dominance, gravel road signs (thickening of lobular spacing with varying degrees of alveolar filling) and real lung changes.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is little information on the micropathological damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main pathological findings of the autopsy were as follows:</seg>
<seg id="65">Examination of the naked eye: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary edema</seg>
<seg id="66">Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:</seg>
<seg id="67">Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of lung cells, large number of atypical lung cells, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar seepage fluid.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">Recovery pneumonia: alveolar cavity seepage fluid mechanization and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); young white-young red blood cell reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection include: staying at home; avoiding entering densely populated areas; washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends covering the mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing; if there is no paper towel, it is recommended to cover the inside of the elbow.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is recommended that hand hygiene be properly cleaned after coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="75">The CDC recommends wearing cloth masks in public places to prevent asymptomatic patients from transmitting the virus to some extent. The core of the social distance strategy is to close schools and workplaces, restrict travel and cancel large public gatherings, thereby reducing the chances of infected people coming into contact with large groups.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, the social distance criterion stipulates that a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) should be maintained in interpersonal communication.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are no effective drugs to prevent COVID-19. Given that a vaccine is not expected to be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are the key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, known as "leveling the epidemiological curve".</seg>
<seg id="78">At the same time, the CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when there is obvious dirt on their hands, before meals and after blowing their noses, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">In addition, it is recommended to use alcohol-containing hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content to wash hands, but only when there is no soap and running water around. For areas where water-free hand sanitizers cannot be purchased, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">These formulations stimulate antimicrobial activity through ethanol or isopropyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="81">Use hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a "hand disinfectant active substance".</seg>
<seg id="82">Add glycerin as a moisturizer.</seg>
<seg id="83">Provide people with supportive care, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other important organ support affected.</seg>
<seg id="84">The CDC recommends that suspected virus carriers wear simple masks.</seg>
<seg id="85">External membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to relieve the symptoms of respiratory failure, but its benefits have yet to be studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is recommended to maintain personal hygiene and promote healthy lifestyles and eating habits in order to improve immunity.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supportive therapy may be effective for mildly ill patients in the early stages of infection. The WHO and China's National Health and Health Commission have issued an initiative calling for proper care for COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="88">American critical disease experts and lung experts have compiled the treatment recommendations made by various institutions and provided them free of charge through the IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, no COVID-19 special effects therapy has been developed.</seg>
<seg id="90">For some symptoms, some medical experts recommend the use of paracetamol (paracetamol) instead of ibuprofen for first-line treatment.</seg>
<seg id="91">Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, and special attention should be paid to protection when completing operations that may produce aerosols in a medical environment, such as intubation or hand ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="92">For medical personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure prevention measures and air transmission prevention measures, patients should also be transferred to the Air Transmission Infectious Diseases Isolation Room (AIIR). The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If possible, it is best to use a respirator (rather than a mask).</seg>
<seg id="94">The N95 mask is allowed to be used in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of the mask under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">It is mainly used to prevent the inhalation of suspended particulates (such as dust), but it cannot be used for other purposes to ensure the effective isolation of specific biological agents.</seg>
<seg id="96">If there is no mask, the CDC recommends using a mask and, if necessary, wearing a homemade mask.</seg>
<seg id="97">Most COVID-19 cases have mild symptoms and do not require mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain proportion of cases require such measures.</seg>
<seg id="98">Medical personnel are actively conducting research in the hope of providing respiratory support to patients with COVID-19 with symptoms of respiratory failure. There is evidence that transnasal high-flow oxygen therapy or two-phase positive airway pressure ventilation can avoid intubation.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is unclear whether the above two treatment options can have the same effect on seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="100">If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use invasive mechanical ventilation because this technology can also limit the spread of aerosol particles compared to transnasal high-flow oxygen therapy. Serious cases are mainly among the elderly (over the age of 60, especially over the age of 80).</seg>
<seg id="101">The number of beds per capita in many developed countries is insufficient. In view of the limited medical conditions, the medical system is unable to cope with the severe situation that requires hospitalization due to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">A study in China found that 5% of patients need to be sent to intensive care units, 2.3% need mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% will die as a result.</seg>
<seg id="103">About 30% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in China are eventually sent to the ICU.</seg>
<seg id="104">With the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation has further increased and oxygenation is becoming more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="105">At that time, it is necessary to adopt a ventilator that supports pressure control mode and high PEEP in order to maximize the delivery of oxygen, while minimizing the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by the ventilator.</seg>
<seg id="106">Old-fashioned ventilators may not be able to achieve high PEEP.</seg>
<seg id="107">Since January 2020, potential therapies have been studied, and a number of antiviral drugs have entered the clinical trial stage.</seg>
<seg id="108">Redsive seems to be one of the most promising drugs at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="109">Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.</seg>
<seg id="110">Seriously ill patients can try to use antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="111">The WHO calls on volunteers to participate in the test of the effectiveness and safety of potential therapy. The FDA has temporarily authorized plasma transfusion during the recovery period as an experimental treatment to treat seriously ill patients whose lives are in danger.</seg>
<seg id="112">At present, the necessary clinical studies have not been carried out to prove whether the therapy can safely and effectively treat this disease.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China released a mobile app to curb the outbreak of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="114">Users are required to enter their name and ID number as required.</seg>
<seg id="115">This app can detect "close contact" through monitoring data and then judge the potential risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of the other three users.</seg>
<seg id="117">Once potential risks are detected, the app will not only recommend self-isolation, but also alert local health officials. A combination of mobile data big data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence will be used to track infected people and those they come into contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, China, and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government approved security agencies to track mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus carriers.</seg>
<seg id="119">The purpose of this measure is to enforce segregation and protect groups that may come into contact with infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the aggregated mobile phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="121">Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect people who violate quarantine rules.</seg>
<seg id="122">Giulio Gallera, Italy's regional health commissioner, noted that mobile phone operator data showed that "40 percent of citizens are still walking around."</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government held a 48-hour weekend hacking marathon, which was attended by more than 42,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="124">In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions on a global scale to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">Isolation, travel restrictions, treatment for side effects or fear of self-infection can all be troubling.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are perfect storms that harm people's mental health and well-being."</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease is mild, with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="128">Mild cases can usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.</seg>
<seg id="129">According to data from other similar viruses (such as SARS and MERS), pregnant women have a higher risk of developing into seriously ill patients with COVID-19, but lack the support of COVID-19 data. COVID-19 may affect the lungs of some people, leading to pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="130">In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">COVID-19-related complications include sepsis, abnormal coagulation, and heart, kidney and liver damage.</seg>
<seg id="132">6% Of patients admitted to COVID-19 had abnormal coagulation, especially the extension of thrombinogen time, while 4% of patients in this group had abnormal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="133">About 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminase).</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time from morbidity to death is 10 days, of which the average length of hospitalization is five days.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the average time between admission and death of patients transferred to the ICU is seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">Early case studies found that the average time from the onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with an overall time range of 6 to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">A study by China's National Health and Hygiene Commission (NHC) found that the male mortality rate was 2.8% and the female mortality rate was 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="138">The histopathological examination of autopsy lung samples showed that diffuse alveolar injury with cell fibrous mucus-like secretions occurred in both lungs.</seg>
<seg id="139">Viral cell lesions were observed in lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="140">The lung image is similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">Of the deaths reported by China's National Health and Hygiene Commission, 11.8% were due to heart damage caused by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients have a past medical history. The availability of medical resources and regional socio-economic conditions may also affect the mortality rate.</seg>
<seg id="143">Given regional differences and methodological difficulties, estimates of disease mortality vary.</seg>
<seg id="144">Underestimating mild cases can lead to an overestimation of mortality.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, if the death of a case is due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">Compared with non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop into COVID-19 seriously ill patients and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die. People are concerned about the long-term after-effects of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="147">The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, China, found that the lung capacity of some rehabilitated patients decreased by 20% to 30%, and lung scans showed organ damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">In addition, he may face post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it is uncertain whether past infections will enable rehabilitated people to receive effective long-term immunization.</seg>
<seg id="150">According to the behavioral characteristics of other coronaviruses, immunity may be produced, but it has been reported that some COVID-19 cases tested positive for coronavirus shortly after recovery.</seg>
<seg id="151">These cases are thought to be a continuous deterioration of infection rather than re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="152">The virus is thought to be a natural virus that originated in animals and is infected through spillage.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the scope of infection is almost entirely human-to-human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="154">The study of the first batch of 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases published in The Lancet in January 2020 shows that the earliest date of onset is December 1, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="155">The earliest date of onset reported in the official WHO publication is December 8, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="157">These figures vary from region to region and will change over time and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as inspection and measurement, the quality of the health system, treatment programs, the time of the first outbreak of the epidemic, as well as age, sex and overall health status.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, the WHO designated the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to the laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection death cases, and U07.2 to the clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 death cases infected with COVID-19 but not confirmed by the laboratory. The case fatality rate is equal to the total number of deaths within a given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).</seg>
<seg id="160">Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the number of disease deaths as a percentage of the number of confirmed cases, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the number of disease deaths as a percentage of the number of infections (both confirmed and undiagnosed).</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics have no time limit and track the whole process of a particular population from infection to case resolution.</seg>
<seg id="162">Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infected people.</seg>
<seg id="163">The Italian epidemic center Castiglione d'Ada is a small town with a population of only 4,600. At present, 80 people (1.7%) have died from the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="164">In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various carnival days, even affecting young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.</seg>
<seg id="165">Moreover, Germany's health-care system is already overburdened.</seg>
<seg id="166">According to the assessment of blood donors, about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="167">To date, 69 people (0.004% of the total population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary according to gender.</seg>
<seg id="169">Studies in China and Italy show that the mortality rate of men is higher than that of women.</seg>
<seg id="170">Men aged 50-60 have the highest risk of death, with only a similar gender gap in the 90-year-old age group.</seg>
<seg id="171">China has a male mortality rate of 2.8% and a female mortality rate of 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact reasons for this gender difference are unclear, but may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Based on gender-based immunological differences, the smoking rate of women is low, and the age at which men develop complications (such as hypertension) is lower than that of women, resulting in a higher mortality rate for men than for women.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, men account for 57% of those infected, and the proportion of men in the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 is as high as 72%.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked gender-related data on COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="176">Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola virus, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.</seg>
<seg id="177">The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher and the risk of exposure to the virus is higher.</seg>
<seg id="178">On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease would be officially named "COVID-19".</seg>
<seg id="179">Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, explained this: CO stands for "corona", VI stands for "virus", D stands for "disease", and 19 stands for the time of the first outbreak of the epidemic (December 31, 2019).</seg>
<seg id="180">The name was chosen to avoid referring to specific geographical locations (for example, China), animal species or populations in order to meet international naming recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that triggered COVID-19 is known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In addition, the WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus that causes COVID-19" in mass communication.</seg>
<seg id="182">Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".</seg>
<seg id="183">During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, people generally referred to viruses and diseases as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary virus and disease names, in accordance with the 2015 guidelines on the use of locations in disease and virus names.</seg>
<seg id="185">On February 11, 2020, the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released.</seg>
<seg id="186">Given the capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have begun printing health care materials, such as nose swabs and respirator components.</seg>
<seg id="187">For example, an Italian hospital was in urgent need of ventilation valves, the supplier was unable to deliver the components within the required time, and a local start-up carried out reverse engineering to print out the required 100 ventilation valves overnight.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were widespread and quickly spread through the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">The study found no evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">At present, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="192">Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively conducting international research to develop vaccines and drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Experiment" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that are most likely to produce curative effects.</seg>
<seg id="194">At present, there is no vaccine, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="195">Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through the ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to take advantage of the previous work of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three vaccine strategies are being studied.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, researchers plan to develop an all-virus vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">The purpose of using such viruses, whether inactive or dead, is to provoke a rapid immune response in the human body when newly infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy is to develop a subunit vaccine, which aims to develop a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focused on the S-thorn protein that assists the virus in invading the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is to develop a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).</seg>
<seg id="202">The safety and effectiveness of the experimental vaccine developed by the above-mentioned strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first clinical trial of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine contains harmless gene sequences copied from the virus that causes the disease. It has long been thought that antibody dependence enhancement may be a major challenge in the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this claim is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="204">As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.</seg>
<seg id="205">Seven trials were evaluated and approved for use in the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">The conversion of antiviral drugs accounts for the vast majority of research in China. Nine Phase III clinical trials on Redcivir will be conducted in many countries by the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently being evaluated, including Redcivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, Lopinave/Litonave and Lopinave/Litonave combination interferon beta.</seg>
<seg id="208">As of March 2020, the efficacy of Redcivir has been preliminarily confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="209">After observation, it was found that the clinical symptoms of patients treated with compassionate drug Redcivir were alleviated.</seg>
<seg id="210">At present, the United States, China and Italy are conducting Phase III clinical trials. In February 2020, China launched a study on chloroquine (previously used to treat malaria) and obtained preliminary results.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, there were calls for a peer review of the study.</seg>
<seg id="212">South Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1 g a day, while reminding that twice the dose is very dangerous and may even be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="214">On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to use the two drugs to treat patients with COVID-19. The seventh edition of China's guidelines also proposes the use of interferon, ribavirin or abidol hydrochloride to treat COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data show that high doses of ribavirin have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="216">After confirming the low concentration inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to use nitrozonit for further in vivo research. The research shows that the primitive spiny protein caused by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a necessary condition for the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors into the human body.</seg>
<seg id="217">Whether or not used in combination with azithromycin, there are serious limitations in the study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These treatments cannot be accepted by the medical community unless further research is carried out. Oseltamivir has no inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has not yet been found to have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="218">Cytokine storms may become a complication of later treatment in patients with severe COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. After completing a small study, China's National Health and Health Commission included tozhu monoclonal antibody in the treatment guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="220">Following the positive test results of seriously ill patients, Italy is conducting phase 2 non-randomized trials at the national level.</seg>
<seg id="221">Combined with serum ferritin blood tests, the identification of cytokine storms is aimed at curbing the development of the disease, and cytokine storms are thought to lead to the death of some infected people.</seg>
<seg id="222">In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, the FDA approved the use of interleukin 6 receptor antagonists to treat steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, or CAR T cell therapy, caused by other causes.</seg>
<seg id="223">So far, there is no randomized controlled evidence that Tozhu monoclonal antibody can effectively treat CRS.</seg>
<seg id="224">At present, studies are under way to extract purified concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of COVID-19 rehabilitated persons and inject them into people in need of antibodies as passive immune therapy until the vaccine is successfully developed.</seg>
<seg id="225">This strategy was tried during the SARS epidemic, but the efficacy is inconclusive.</seg>
<seg id="226">Virus neutralization is an expected mechanism for passive antibody therapy to mediate the immune defense of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="227">However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis can achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive antibody therapy are being developed, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="229">The amount of serum produced during rehabilitation may increase, which is conducive to rapid deployment. The serum consists of the liquid part of the blood of the rehabilitated patient, which contains specific antibodies against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="230">Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes</seg>
<seg id="231">Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, raised his awareness of the spread of the new crown virus, then unfortunately contracted COVID-19 and died.</seg>

<seg id="3">Theme: [Covid-19] Light up and get ready for the future</seg>
<seg id="4">Date/time of dispatch: 14 March 2020 00:24 (UTC)</seg>
<seg id="5">License: CC0: no rights reserved</seg>
<seg id="6">Since this month, we have encountered some difficult circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we clearly feel the solidarity of the fate of all mankind and at the same time realize our responsibilities to each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We face unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best response to such challenges requires people around the world to empathize, work together and promote community-building, which is the core concept of Wikimedia.</seg>
<seg id="9">All colleagues convey fraternity and care to each other through e-mail, telephone and chat, which fully proves the extraordinaryness of our colleagues and how fortunate we are to work with you.</seg>
<seg id="10">I am extremely grateful and proud to be colleagues with you.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">They made me realize how meaningful it is that the world can use Wikipedia at this moment. At the same time, they also made me realize the symbolic power that maintaining the normal operation of this key resource brings to people all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whether your work is responsible for website operation, salary payment or community security, the normal operation of Wikimedia is inseparable from your hard work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now more than ever, the world needs the information provided by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="15">At this stage, the content of our work and even the way we work will have an important impact on the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">In view of the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities shouldered by colleagues, we will make some important adjustments to the way we collaborate from next week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adjustments to working methods and schedules</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss the company's working methods and timetable for the next few days to months.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the meeting, we considered what we considered to be an appropriate response to the current challenges facing the company, as well as best practices to ensure that the company maintains sustainable development during the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">The executive team agreed to relieve the pressure on the company's employees so that everyone can support the company's mission for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="21">We support you in properly reducing the pressure of your work.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all employees, contractors and contract workers:</seg>
<seg id="23">Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours a day (or 20 hours a week). Any subsequent changes will be notified separately.</seg>
<seg id="24">This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer hours every day, we will arrange tasks for you according to your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as taking care of your family, going shopping or seeing a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will not track your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are ill, please put down your work.</seg>
<seg id="28">Although this is self-evident, we still want to remind you, please rest assured.</seg>
<seg id="29">You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team revise the work calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of the Talent and Culture Operations Department, which will support you and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from management.)</seg>
<seg id="31">For hourly employees, we will pay in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have expressed and recommitted ourselves to the commitments made to contractors and hourly workers.</seg>
<seg id="33">The salary we pay to everyone will continue to be calculated on the basis of the remuneration they receive for completing their normal working hours under normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if you are sick or unable to work, it is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are willing to work, we will provide you with support.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through their work and release their pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">Our work can bring incredible returns, especially at a time like this.</seg>
<seg id="38">But taking care of yourself is still the first priority.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can keep abreast of your latest situation and make adjustments accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Priority is given to safeguarding important work.</seg>
<seg id="41">We must maintain the normal functioning of some important work.</seg>
<seg id="42">The work carried out by the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operation team, the trust and security team and the fundraising team (and other teams) is critical and may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will begin to work with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting some matters that are critical to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important items.</seg>
<seg id="45">A temporary slowdown will not affect future development.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not intend to "work overtime to catch up" after the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="47">We won't ask you to work overtime to catch up with the schedule, because it seems impractical now.</seg>
<seg id="48">We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="49">How will the APP (annual plan) change?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to adapt to the new realities and daily working time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">We hope to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time for budgeting to enable employees to prioritize critical work and take care of themselves and their families, and to adjust work arrangements for employees who need or want to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="52">Extending the schedule can significantly reduce the current planned workload of the organization as a whole and reduce work pressure.</seg>
<seg id="53">We will submit the above proposal to the board of directors next week. If the proposal is adopted, we will update the follow-up working arrangements to delegates and teams as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thank the APP team for their leadership in this process.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office condition, exposure and cleaning</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that a colleague from the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">But, out of prudence, we hired some anti-virus cleaners to thoroughly disinfect the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They used hospital-level disinfection solutions to disinfect various surfaces and the halls and elevators leading to our floors.</seg>
<seg id="59">The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement and using the corresponding products to ensure the safety of tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We believe that when everyone decides to return to work, the office is fully prepared to welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our Washington, D.C. office uses the WeWork office, which shares the COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington, D.C. staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office had been converted to full-time telecommuting in accordance with the guidance measures we shared with the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="63">At the same time, as some colleagues in the New York office already know, we have also been discussing the issue of leasing office space in Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">These discussions continue, but may be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some colleagues came into contact with telecommuting for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="66">Other long-term telecommuting colleagues want to provide them with some advice on adjusting their working methods:</seg>
<seg id="67">It is advisable to limit the meeting time to one to two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If it takes longer, consider spreading the content of the meeting over multiple dates.</seg>
<seg id="69">Clearly define the objectives of the meeting, formulate the agenda of the meeting, and send reading materials in advance.</seg>
<seg id="70">Use videoconferencing as the default mode of meeting, while using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom for online collaboration and contact.</seg>
<seg id="71">In each meeting, arrange for a moderator to preside over the meeting, arrange for one person to monitor the questions in the chat window and track the changes in the list of speakers, and arrange for another person to be responsible (or use multiplayer collaboration) to help make the minutes of the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need comfortable headphones, please send an email to contact the technical support department.</seg>
<seg id="73">Use your health allowance to buy snacks.</seg>
<seg id="74">Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues</seg>
<seg id="75">The human resources operation team is studying ergonomics guidance in the form of webinars to help all Foundation colleagues improve their work efficiency during distributed office.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as Editing Song, before the WHO announced the end of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="77">These requests for cancellations and other restrictions may prevent these community recipients from completing their intended donation activities, and we have informed them that we understand this and promised that none of them will be punished for postponing or modifying these goals.</seg>
<seg id="78">Over the next week, we will continue to provide more guidance at community meetings and thematic community meetings in Wikimania and other regions.</seg>
<seg id="79">The global community now seems to be shrouded in grief over the devastation caused by the epidemic, but it also reflects relief from being able to keep a clear eye on their communities, Wikimedia and others.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the future, the CRT team will build a page on Meta-Wiki to provide the community with a space to monitor the impact and track the community's communication with us.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maintain contact and communicate issues related to COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="82">We plan to hold a special staff meeting at 14:00 (UTC)/07:00 (Pacific Time) next Thursday. We will send the relevant invitation to your calendar later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Laboratory detection methods for 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include: detecting the presence of the virus and detecting the production of antibodies after infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">RT-PCR can detect the RNA of the coronavirus and determine whether there is a virus in the sample.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is a specific test of the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be used to determine whether there has been a recent infection or whether there is an active infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody testing (serum testing) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody tests show how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with mild symptoms that are not reported or asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease, as well as the level of group immunity in the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country/region has been able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.</seg>
<seg id="9">As of March 23, no country/region had tested more than 3% of its population, and the number of tests completed by each country/region varied greatly.</seg>
<seg id="10">This difference may also seriously affect the reported case mortality rate, which may be seriously overestimated in some countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection using pharynx and throat swabs can obtain reliable results only if it is completed within the first week after infection with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RT-PCR test using pharynx swabs can obtain reliable results only if it is completed within the first week after infection with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, the virus disappeared in the throat, but continued to reproduce in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">For infected persons tested in the second week after infection, the sample can be replaced with a deep respiratory tract extract obtained through a sputum suction tube, or a cough extract (sputum) can be used.</seg>
<seg id="16">In January 2020, rRT-PCR was released at Charite Hospital in Berlin, one of the early PCR detection methods, and became the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">On January 23, 2020, the UK also developed a detection method. On January 28, 2020, Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, developed a clinical-level, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">It looks for the "E" gene common to all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene unique to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency use approval of the China National Drug Administration for the production of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through the international reagent resource department, distributed the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to the public health laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="19">Early versions of the test kit used three genetic testing methods, one of which was unable to determine the results due to reagent defects, while the Atlanta CDC had a detection bottleneck; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">The two-part test was not found to be reliable until February 28, 2020, when the state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the basis of an emergency use authorization. The U.S. commercial laboratory began testing in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">LabCorp announced that COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR could be carried out nationwide from March 5, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics also announced that a nationwide COVID-19 test would be available from March 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantitative restrictions have been announced; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, COVID-19 detection is developed and produced by the National Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).</seg>
<seg id="26">On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Health Supervision Bureau of the Russian Federation. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a kit that could detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, a test method for Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA. This method can complete a large number of tests in 3.5 hours, so that a device can carry out about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to use Abbott's m2000 system for testing; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020, Cepheid's test method, which takes about 45 minutes, was also granted emergency use authorization by the FDA.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA has approved a detection method that uses nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since this method does not require a series of temperature-changing cycles, positive results can be obtained in only 5 minutes and negative results can be determined in 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">There are currently about 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott is expected to increase production so that it can provide 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is developing a detection method using monoclonal antibodies (which specifically bind to the nuclear capsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus) in the hope that it will provide the test results in 15 to 20 minutes, as in the case of rapid influenza detection.</seg>
<seg id="32">A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of chest films is small, and the performance of CT [computed tomography] may be obvious, even before the symptoms appear"</seg>
<seg id="33">The typical features of CT include double lung multi-leaf grinding glass shadow, with peripheral asymmetry and posterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="34">As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, gravel road signs and lung changes will develop.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan (the site of the initial outbreak of the current pandemic) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but the accuracy of CT is low, and many of its imaging features overlap with other pneumonia and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="36">As of March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommended that "CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC has recommended the use of PCR for initial screening.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about seven days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immunity of the monitored population. The determination can be carried out in the central laboratory (CLT) or through instant detection (PoCT).</seg>
<seg id="39">Many high-throughput automatic systems in clinical laboratories can carry out the above determination, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by sequence samples, it is usually determined using a peripheral blood sample.</seg>
<seg id="41">For PoCT, skin puncture is generally used to obtain a blood sample.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is no need to perform extraction steps before determination, which is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the detection methods declared by 29 entities, which are now able to distribute their antibody detection kits.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one test under the emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the testing kits of Omon Medical Experimental Diagnostics AG and Epitope Diagnostics were approved in Europe. These kits can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="44">The detection ability can detect hundreds of samples in a few hours, so the determination of viral RNA is much faster than that of traditional PCR.</seg>
<seg id="45">In general, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody detection kits it purchased were good enough.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hong Kong has established a mechanism for suspected patients to live at home. "Emergency rooms provide patients with sample test tubes". The patient vomits saliva into the test tube and sends the test tube back. The results will be received later. The UK NHS announced that it is piloting a home-based test for suspected cases, which will eliminate the risk of patients infecting others when they go to the hospital. It can also eliminate the risk that patients must disinfect the ambulance after using the ambulance. When conducting a car-free test for suspected cases of COVID-19, medical professionals can take appropriate preventive measures to take samples.</seg>
<seg id="47">The drop-free testing center has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and most extensive tests than other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that non-hospitalized institutions have the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests a day, compared with 10,700 in the previous week.</seg>
<seg id="48">If the test is carried out at the request of the doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, the total detection capacity in Germany is 160,000 copies per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of March 19, car-free testing has been provided in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As of March 26, 2020, the total number of people tested in Germany is not known, as only the number of people who tested positive was reported.</seg>
<seg id="52">An initial laboratory survey showed that by the 12th week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested (including the 12th week of 2020) and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing samples of 64 patients at the same time, that is, summarizing the samples and further testing only when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, Huada Gene (BGI) temporarily established a 2,000-square-meter emergency testing laboratory called "Fire Eye", which was put into use on February 5, 2020, and can handle more than 10,000 samples per day.</seg>
<seg id="53">The laboratory was built in five days under the supervision of Wang Jian, founder of Huada Gene. Modeling shows that if the above-mentioned detection ability had not been achieved, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment and isolation costs would have doubled.</seg>
<seg id="54">Following the Wuhan laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately established the Fire Eye Laboratory. At present, a total of 12 cities in China have established the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="55">By March 4, 2020, the total daily flux of laboratory tests will be 50,000 copies per day. The open-source, multi-channel design released by Origami Assays allows up to 1,122 patient samples to be tested for COVID19 through only 93 measurements. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for automatic fluid transfer devices.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="57">This has led some sponsors to explore the sample preparation scheme, which involves heating the sample to 98°C (208°F) for up to five minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on March 31 that more of its population has now been tested for the new crown virus, more people have been tested than any other country, and is expanding the level of testing to allow a large number of people to be tested.</seg>
<seg id="58">The way to realize this detection capability is, on the one hand, to use drive-through testing, on the other hand, to fund Group 42 and Huada Gene (based on its "Fire Eye" emergency testing laboratory in China) to establish high-throughput laboratories to meet the testing needs of large-scale populations.</seg>
<seg id="59">The laboratory was built in 14 days and can carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day. It is the first laboratory of this size in the world to operate outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States have all developed different detection methods for various parts of the coronavirus gene map.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test kits to send kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German method was announced on January 17, 2020; the plan developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be available until January 28, thus limiting the detection ability of the United States. Both China and the United States encountered problems with the reliability of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak. These two countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient test kits to meet the demand and the testing recommendations made by health experts.</seg>
<seg id="63">On the contrary, experts believe that extensive testing in South Korea is very helpful in reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thanks to the detection capacity established by the Korean government in the past few years, it is mainly concentrated in private sector laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to a very high demand for testing, which has led to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents has begun to become tight.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its testing kit.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC had "defects"; subsequently, the government removed bureaucratic obstacles to private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Yirui Biotechnology Co. Ltd. and found that the test results were inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The company explained that the inaccurate test results may be due to the incorrect collection of samples or the erroneous use of test kits.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish cabinet said it would recover the kit that returned the wrong results and replace it with another kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% Of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China had incorrect test results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China and found them inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matovic suggested that the test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test boxes purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test boxes from China and announced in April 2020 that the test boxes could not be used.</seg>
<seg id="71">Positive results can be obtained by testing, isolating those who tested positive and tracking the contact history of those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the city of Va, Italy, where the first COVID-19 patient died, conducted two rounds of tests on a group of about 3,400 people, each about 10 days apart.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of them tested positive and asymptomatic, and all the cases found were isolated.</seg>
<seg id="74">By imposing travel restrictions on the community, new infections have been completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on inbound travel, testing and isolation, the transmission of the 2020 coronavirus in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not taken extreme restrictive measures, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail places.</seg>
<seg id="76">Singapore canceled many activities and began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but the school resumed classes on time on March 23 after the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries/regions, such as Ireland and South Korea, have also controlled the large-scale epidemic of the disease through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on inbound travel, testing and isolation, and less aggressive blockade measures.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that the more countries tested compared to the number of deaths, the lower the case mortality rate, which may be due to the fact that these countries are better able to detect groups with only mild or asymptomatic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to test and have limited experience in handling COVID-19 in national laboratories send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.</seg>
<seg id="80">Of the 16 reference laboratories, seven are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the following chart, the "test positive%" list is affected by the testing policy of the country in which it is located.</seg>
<seg id="82">Under the same other conditions, countries that only test hospitalized persons have a higher positive detection rate than countries that test all citizens, whether or not they show symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Between January 1 and March 15, 2020, the cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased rapidly</seg>
<seg id="2">In various countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) shows a similar trend, confirming that although different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the experience of Italy, the state, hospitals and intensive care wards need to be better prepared to meet the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients. The task of intensive care is particularly heavy.</seg>
<seg id="4">On December 31, 2019, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, reported a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause.</seg>
<seg id="5">On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported that the pathogen is a new type of coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence to date shows that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most recover.</seg>
<seg id="8">In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 will progress to severe disease and require hospitalization, while the remaining 6% will progress to critical disease and require intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mortality rate of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is about 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this study, we assessed the trend of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in various countries of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compared it with Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="13">After China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has further expanded. At present, the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to those in China.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the European Monitor magazine published on March 5, 2020, Spiteri et al. Reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.</seg>
<seg id="16">In EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020. The patient was a returnee from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom. From December 31 to March 15, 2019, including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths had been reported in Italy alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases obtained</seg>
<seg id="19">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported by each country in the world at 8:00 am every day. They are obtained only through official sources, such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data have been used to assess trends in EU/EEA and COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and to compare them with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">We calculated the 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom between January 1 and March 15, 2020, as an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, in order to take into account the natural course of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="22">We also provided the total number of cumulative cases reported by each country as of 8:00 am on March 15, 2020, and compared it with the data of Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="24">The trend of 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with that in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21, 2020, and then increased sharply around February 28 (supplementary material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom shows a similar growth trend (supplementary material).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom between January 31 and March 15, 2020, and compares them with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="28">It should be emphasized that as of 8:00 am on March 15, the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported the same total number of cases as Italy in less than three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported by the EU/EEA and the UK is increasing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="30">The observed trend of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 shows that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">Although countries are at different stages, national public health responses vary, the definition of cases may vary from country to country, and there are differences in the options used to select patients who must undergo COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including additional tests, but the situation is the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, about 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care, and media reports indicate that hospitals and intensive care wards in these areas have reached their maximum capacity.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the EU/EEA level, the data currently available is that only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases are hospitalized/or admitted to intensive care wards, respectively (the data are not shown).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to supplement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there are great differences in the number of intensive care and medium-term care beds available in European countries. The number of beds per 100,000 people ranges from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and medium-term care beds per 100,000 people in 2010-2011).</seg>
<seg id="37">The sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 modeled the scenario related to the saturation of health care capacity and estimated the relationship between the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom and the risk of exceeding the number of intensive care beds by &gt;90%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since cases have so far been concentrated in EU/EEA countries and certain regions of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care wards usually provide services to the population covered in the identified areas, it is advisable to provide information on cases and intensive care beds at the level of "Standard Statistical Geographical Module 2" (NUTS-2).</seg>
<seg id="39">The experience of Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEA and the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom are developing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, the state, hospitals and intensive care wards should be prepared to deal with the continuous community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment pointed out, a rapid, active and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2. There needs to be a transition from containment to mitigation, because if not implemented ahead of schedule, the rapid increase in the number of expected cases may leave policymakers and hospitals with insufficient time to understand, accept and adjust the response.</seg>
<seg id="42">The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">At present, there is a short window of opportunity through which countries may further strengthen their control efforts in order to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health care system.</seg>
<seg id="44">Otherwise, the health-care systems of other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge in the number of patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">The origin of human-animal co-morbidity of human coronavirus</seg>
<seg id="2">For thousands of years, mutation and adaptability have been driving the coevolution of Coronaviruses (CoV) and their hosts, including humans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prior to 2003, two types of human coronavirus (HCoV) were known to cause minor diseases, such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have turned the situation around, revealing the destructive and lethal nature of HCoV infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has once again made CoV the focus of attention. Surprisingly, compared with its sister virus, SARS-CoV, it has strong transmission but low pathogenicity.</seg>
<seg id="6">HCoV infection is a kind of human-animal co-morbidity. Therefore, understanding the origin of human-animal co-morbidity of HCoV will be very helpful to us.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most HCoVs are derived from bats and are non-pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some intermediate storage hosts of HCoV are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">The identification of animal hosts is of direct significance to the prevention of human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studying the interaction of CoV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of human CoV.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we summarize the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, highlighting their discovery history, the origin of human-animal co-morbidity and interspecific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Importantly, we compared and compared different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.</seg>
<seg id="13">Against this background, we discussed the current epidemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, this paper also focuses on the requirements for successfully completing host conversion and the impact of virus evolution on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">CoV belongs to the coronavirus family and consists of a group of just single-stranded RNA viruses with envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, containing between 26,000 and 32,000 bases, and are known as "coronavirus" (CoV) because of their coronal form under electron microscopy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, CoV has a non-segmented genome that shares similar tissues.</seg>
<seg id="18">About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication enzyme polyproteins.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins, called nsp1-16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains the ORF of structural proteins, including prickles (S), envelopes (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">Many lineage-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by CoVs of different lineages.</seg>
<seg id="22">Depending on the protein sequence, CoV is divided into four genera (α-CoV, β-CoV, γ-CoV and δ-CoV), of which β-CoV contains most HCoV and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most α-CoV and β-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of γ-CoV and δ-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed the species barrier, some of which have become important human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, seven types of coronavirus (HCoV) are known to infect humans.</seg>
<seg id="26">Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are α-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other five types of β-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively large number of patients, and are more likely to develop into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the mid-1960s, the first strain of the HCoV-229E virus, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, through extensive research on two HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, both of which can cause self-limiting symptoms, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, before the outbreak of SARS, the concept that infection with HCoV was usually harmless was widely accepted.</seg>
<seg id="33">The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude death rate of about 10%.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, after the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The 2019 new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen of the ongoing epidemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As of March 3, 2020, it has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm has been sounded, and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven species of HCoV have the origin of human-animal co-morbidity from bats, mice or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">A variety of evidence shows that the evolution of all HCoVs originated in bats. The viruses in bats are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.</seg>
<seg id="40">Tracking the origin of human-animal co-morbidity in HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and constraints of viral species jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, this will guide or promote the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts and expanded animal hosts, which is of great significance to prevent future virus spills.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this review, we outline the origin, interspecific transmission and pathogenesis of human-animal co-morbidity in HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we highlighted and explored a common topic, namely that the parent virus of HCoV is usually not pathogenic in its natural storage host, but is pathogenic after transmission across species to a new host.</seg>
<seg id="44">In addition, we also review the trend of HCoV evolution, in which the increase of communicability is often accompanied by the decrease of pathogenicity.</seg>
<seg id="45">Against this background, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="46">Since the late 1930s, the animal CoV has been widely known.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretions of people with the common cold, medical scientists had isolated different CoVs in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the past few decades, seven species of HCoV have been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="49">A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will provide us with rich information and guiding significance.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 1966, the first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection and subsequently adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung cell strain.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat, and 10-20% of patients have fever, cough and other symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and subsequent continuous transmission of the mouse brain.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to that of HCoV-229E infection, and there is no significant difference in symptoms compared with other respiratory pathogens (such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus) infection.</seg>
<seg id="54">HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in winter in temperate climates.</seg>
<seg id="55">Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, after which they will develop for about two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="56">A study of human volunteers showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E develop a mild common cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few patients with low immune function showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.</seg>
<seg id="58">SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history. Its pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first case of SARS can be traced back to Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">In addition to super-communicators, it is estimated that each case may bring about 2 secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load on the 10th day of onset.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and chills, followed by advanced symptoms such as difficulty breathing, cough and respiratory distress.</seg>
<seg id="63">Reduced lymphocytes, abnormal liver function and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.</seg>
<seg id="64">In addition, diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages increase were observed in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">Subsequently, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In these severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, may also be infected, often accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal in patients with low immune function.</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the source patient who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, people have been working on HCoV research.</seg>
<seg id="69">HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="70">The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immune-impaired patients with respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis are common.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study showed that the same virus was isolated from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis (also known as Grubb's laryngitis).</seg>
<seg id="76">In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be associated with acute asthma attacks.</seg>
<seg id="78">Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are usually unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases. However, there have also been accidents for unknown reasons, such as a rare and more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause serious lower respiratory infections in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Typically, when these HCoVs gain the ability to spread effectively and survive in the human body, their toxicity or pathogenicity also decreases.</seg>
<seg id="81">MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although most laboratory confirmed cases come from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary transmission to close contacts.</seg>
<seg id="83">In 2015, secondary transmission broke out again in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="84">The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to that of SARS and is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also have acute renal failure, which is a unique feature of MERS in diseases caused by HCoV so far.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases had been reported, with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">In mid-to-late December 2019, patients with aggregation pneumonia were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. After retrospective analysis, they were confirmed to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern, and named the disease COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed worldwide, with a crude death rate of 3.4%.</seg>
<seg id="91">It is worth noting that the case fatality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the case fatality rate outside Hubei is 1.2%.</seg>
<seg id="92">Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections, manifested in fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some patients also develop diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the homology of 82% of high nucleotide sequences, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.</seg>
<seg id="96">Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic, but more infectious.</seg>
<seg id="97">An asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported, which may have accelerated the rapid spread of the virus around the world.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="101">Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in community-acquired HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or even asymptomatic manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, a small number of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infection cases, although the proportion is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Thirdly, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows the interesting pattern characteristics of community-acquired HCoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, the spreadability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, whether the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 will decline after human transmission, like that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, remains to be verified.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">At least in some cases, whether the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in SARS-CoV remains to be clarified in future studies.</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, it is important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community-acquired HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenicity and continuous transmission after human transmission will have an important impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">From another perspective, humans have also adapted well to these four HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both sides may be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="114">Both HCoV, which causes serious human diseases, and people suffering from serious HCoV diseases have died out.</seg>
<seg id="115">To this end, HCoV must be replicated enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations to counter host limiting factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it can adapt well, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">Over the years, these four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread among the population, causing people with normal immune function to develop the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require an animal host.</seg>
<seg id="120">In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans, nor can they continue to spread in humans.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to survive and reproduce in human-animal co-pathogenic hosts and may seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate and expanded hosts.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is as highly contagious as community-acquired HCoV, at least for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="124">However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether it can fully adapt to humans and circulate within humans without a host or intermediate animal host.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, it is of some guiding significance to discuss the definition and characteristics of HCoV's evolutionary host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host and expanded host.</seg>
<seg id="127">If an animal has a closely related ancestor that is highly homologous at the level of the nucleotide sequence, the animal will become the evolutionary host of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ancestral viruses are usually highly adaptable and non-pathogenic in this host.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, the storage host will continue to carry HCoV for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parent virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">By contrast, if HCoV is parasitic in the human body shortly after or immediately after being parasitic in the intermediate host, it will not be well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate host can act as a source of human-animal co-morbidity for human infection and play a role in amplifying the host by allowing the virus to replicate briefly and then spread it to humans to expand the scale of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">If HCoV cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate host, a terminal infection may occur.</seg>
<seg id="134">On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even establish long-term locality.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural storage host.</seg>
<seg id="136">A retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that the indexed cases of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.</seg>
<seg id="137">Subsequent seropositivity surveys showed that animal vendors had higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) than the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the live animal market, the fruit beaver (flower beaver) and a beaver cat were found to carry the SARS-CoV-like virus almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="139">The fact that there were no further SARS reports after removing all the beavers from the market indirectly supports this view.</seg>
<seg id="140">However, according to the report, the detection of SARS-CoV by farm beavers in the wild or not in contact with the live animal market is basically negative, indicating that the beaver may be an intermediate amplified host rather than a natural host of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is worth noting that since 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that a variety of small mammals may also act as an intermediate expanded host of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="142">All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="143">Subsequently, the study of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV found a closely related bat coronavirus, known as the SARS-related chrysanthemum bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survives in the Chinese chrysanthemum bat.</seg>
<seg id="144">These bats were positive for the SARS-CoV antibody and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.</seg>
<seg id="145">The virus and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">In addition, the researchers identified a variety of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but with the exception of a designated WIV1, no virus can be isolated as a living virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known receptor of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="149">Experiments have shown that WIV1 extracted from bat dung samples uses bats, beavers and human ACE2 as receptors for its entry into cells.</seg>
<seg id="150">Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS can neutralize WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to the bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.</seg>
<seg id="152">Although the two viruses are highly homologous, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct storage host of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">Phylogenetic analysis placed MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.</seg>
<seg id="154">Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor dipeptide peptidease 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is closer to the corresponding RNA in bat β-CoV from Europe and Africa in phylogenetics.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.</seg>
<seg id="157">MERS-CoV and its close relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, have only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.</seg>
<seg id="158">Therefore, bats may not be the direct storage host of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the seropositivity of single-hump camels to MERS-CoV specific neutralization antibodies is the same as that of camels originating in the Middle East in many African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">The live MERS-CoV isolated from the nose swabs of single-hump camels is the same as the virus found in humans, further indicating that camels are the true storage hosts of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It should also be noted that in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, the symptoms are generally mild, but a large number of viruses have been observed to fall off.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is worth noting that infected camels not only transmit the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the dung-mouth route, which is also the main way for bats to transmit the virus.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, problems remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms appear, which may be attributed to human-to-human or unknown transmission routes, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from the chrysanthemum bat.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent-generation relationship.</seg>
<seg id="166">In other words, unless almost the same bat coronavirus is found in the future, bats may not be the direct storage host of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="167">It is speculated that among the wildlife species that the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be sold and slaughtered at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, many of the initial COVID-19 cases are related to it, indicating that animal-to-human transmission may have occurred.</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies based on macro genome sequencing have shown that an endangered small mammal known as pangolin (Malay pangolin) may also carry the ancestor β-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">These new pangolin coronavirus genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with about 90% homology at the nucleotide sequence level.</seg>
<seg id="171">In the phylogenetic tree, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2-like virus subfamilies, one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and has 97.4% amino acid sequence homology.</seg>
<seg id="172">In sharp contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more different, although their genome-wide sequence homology is higher.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study on diseased pangolin also reported the detection of virus overlap groups from lung samples, which also had a similar relationship with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">The study used different assembly methods and manual processing to obtain part of the genome sequence that accounts for about 86.3% of the virus's total genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to the differences in the β-CoV sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly from pangolin.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the β-CoV associated with pangolin SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="178">The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolin and other mammals has yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="179">Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the β-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 associated with SARS-CoV-2 have the highest genome-wide sequence homology.</seg>
<seg id="180">It can be highly speculated that the high similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV and SARS-CoV-2's RBD is caused by selectively mediated convergent evolution.</seg>
<seg id="181">Another contrary view is that the beta-CoV and RaTG13 associated with pangolin SARS-CoV-2 are recombined in a third species of wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="183">At present, there is no conclusion on the origin of direct human-animal co-morbidity of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the researchers also studied the origin of human-animal co-morbidity in HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.</seg>
<seg id="185">Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the bat coronavirus, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">According to the report, the bat coronavirus known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in three-color bats in North America shows a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008), of which camelids are also suspected to be intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="188">For the sake of clarity, Figure 1 and Table 2 summarize the existing knowledge of the known animal origin of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="189">Phylogenetic analysis provides evidence for the interspecific transmission events of HCoV in history.</seg>
<seg id="190">Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from livestock across species, there was a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="191">The interspecific transmission history of HCoV-229E is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="192">The bat α-CoV, closely related to HCoV-229E, has been found.</seg>
<seg id="193">A type of alpaca α-CoV appears between the two.</seg>
<seg id="194">There are several pieces of evidence to support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, humans, not llamas, may come into contact with bats in a common ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="196">On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="197">Secondly, the bat α-CoV associated with HCoV-229E is diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpaca α-CoV causes an outbreak of respiratory diseases in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, no alpaca α-CoV has been found in wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Therefore, the possibility of alpaca acquiring HCoV-229E-related α-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipa and Hendra.</seg>
<seg id="201">Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">Alternatively, although bat α-CoV acts as a gene bank for HCoV-229E, alpaca and llama may be intermediate hosts for transmitting the virus to humans, exactly the same as in the case of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV is a good illustration of interspecific transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The evolutionary origin of the bat's MERS-CoV has been known since its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries have reinforced this argument.</seg>
<seg id="205">Obviously, bats provide a rich library of virus species for the interspecific exchange and interspecific transmission of gene fragments.</seg>
<seg id="206">Long-lived and dense groups, close social interaction and strong flight ability are all favorable conditions for bats to become ideal "virus carriers".</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the body of a single camel for decades.</seg>
<seg id="208">It has adapted well to these camels, and the camel has changed from an intermediate host to a stable natural storage host.</seg>
<seg id="209">MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and because it cannot continue to spread, humans are still the terminal hosts of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="211">Compared with the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolin in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if any, is different.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, pangolin β-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolin.</seg>
<seg id="213">They may be the terminal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV, similar to the fruit beaver in SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">In future studies, several possibilities for the interspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be identified or ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, bats may be the storage hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans may share ecological niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="217">Secondly, pangolin may be one of the intermediate expanded hosts of the new invasion of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.</seg>
<seg id="218">Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating game.</seg>
<seg id="219">Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">It is necessary to conduct antibody surveys on livestock and wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="221">Thirdly, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may be recombined and adapted in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolin.</seg>
<seg id="222">Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus also play an important role in promoting the coronavirus to cross the interspecific barrier.</seg>
<seg id="224">First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared with other single-stranded RNA viruses, the mutation rate of coronavirus is estimated to be "medium" to "high". According to the adaptation stage of coronavirus to new hosts, the average replacement rate of each site 2 is about 10-4 times a year.</seg>
<seg id="226">Coronaviruses have proofreading-active ribonucleic acid exonuclease, and removing them can lead to very high variability and attenuation, or even inability to survive.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting this ribonucleic acid exonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="228">Redsive is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the mutation rate of coronavirus is about 1 million times higher than that of its host.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, if the coronavirus does not adapt well to the host, its mutation rate is usually high.</seg>
<seg id="231">Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower, indicating that it is more adaptable to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">It can be speculated that it has adapted to another host close to humans.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-hump camels.</seg>
<seg id="234">In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause the rapid failure of vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="235">Secondly, the larger RNA genome in coronaviruses has additional plasticity in the modification of gene mutation and recombination, thus increasing the possibility of interspecies collaborative evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are right.</seg>
<seg id="236">A large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions that encode towards the 3' end of the genome provide evidence for this.</seg>
<seg id="237">Thirdly, coronaviruses switch templates randomly and frequently through a unique "replication selection" mechanism in the process of RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="238">In the host as a mixed container, chain exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.</seg>
<seg id="239">Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs can be recombined to produce new coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="240">Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.</seg>
<seg id="241">Virus-host interactions associated with transmission</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction between the virus and the host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="243">Taking the reorganization of SARS-CoV as a typical example, this paper shows the evidence of positive selection in interspecific transmission events.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on a comparative analysis of the isolated strains of SARS-CoV between humans and fruit beavers, the researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through mutations in the S protein RBD.</seg>
<seg id="245">Usually, the RBD in the coronavirus S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is closely screened by the host antibody response.</seg>
<seg id="246">In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318th to 510th amino acids of the S1 fragment. It binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors to allow the virus to enter.</seg>
<seg id="247">The RBD of SARS-CoV can recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, fruit beavers, mice and beaver cats, thus allowing the virus to spread between species.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, only six amino acid residues different from the isolated strains of human and fruit beaver virus were observed in the RBD, of which four residues were located in the receptor binding sequence interacting with the ACE2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="249">There are K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of the fruit beaver SARS-CoV, which may increase the affinity of fibrous protein interacting with the human ACE2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S protein S1 unit is 30%, which means that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a frozen electron microscopy study showed that the affinity of this binding is 10 to 20 times higher than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.</seg>
<seg id="254">It will also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="255">Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but to different parts of S.</seg>
<seg id="256">In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptidase N of HCoV-229E and the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid of HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also explain why the above-mentioned coronavirus has successfully adapted to humans after cross-species transmission from animal hosts.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cell receptors, the results of HCoV interspecific transmission are also influenced by other host-dependent and restrictive factors.</seg>
<seg id="259">The differences in these host proteins between humans and HCoV natural hosts such as bats, llamas and rodents may constitute an obstacle to interspecific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">In order to successfully achieve interspecific transmission, HCoV must deprive the host dependence factor and break the host restriction factor.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this regard, the molecular determinants in the important field of virus-host interaction have yet to be determined and characterized.</seg>
<seg id="262">Using the latest CRISPR technology, an impartial genome-wide screening of the host dependence and restrictive factors of SARS-CoV-2 may yield results.</seg>
<seg id="263">The emergence of new HCoV: back to where it was</seg>
<seg id="264">The diversity of bat coronavirus provides ample opportunity for the emergence of a new type of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, the bat coronavirus acts as a gene bank for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and gene recombination are also drivers of HCoV evolution and two important steps in this process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes may radically change the phenotype of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">In the SARS-CoV auxiliary protein, due to the isolation of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, it was found that they could encode different ORF8 proteins, so ORF8 was considered important for adapting to humans.</seg>
<seg id="269">At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide deletion features of SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="270">This deficiency divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes host conversion.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV may have recombined with the α-and gamma-CoV lines, with a large number of smaller recombinant regions found in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="272">Recombinant sites have also been found in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, studies have shown that the popularity of MERS-CoV has experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in the single-hump camel in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoV and other animal coronaviruses recombine in their unstructured genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be noted that artificial selection may lead to unexpected changes in the viral genome, which is likely due to reducing the selection pressure exerted by the host immune system faced by the virus.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of these effects is that in the HCoV-229E prototype virus strain, the absence of dinucleotides leads to the absence of full-length ORF4.</seg>
<seg id="277">Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca α-CoV shows a single nucleotide insertion, causing a code-shifting mutation.</seg>
<seg id="278">Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the pressure of storage host selection.</seg>
<seg id="279">After bats were infected with the coronavirus, asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected, indicating that the coronavirus and bats adapted to each other.</seg>
<seg id="280">From an anatomical and physiological point of view, bats seem to have adapted well to the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, the defects in the activation of bat inflammatory response effectively reduce the pathological changes caused by coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules in the main histocompatibility complex, the natural killer cell activity of bats is inhibited.</seg>
<seg id="283">Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen (ROS) produced by the high metabolic activity of bats can not only inhibit coronavirus replication, but also affect proofreading through ribonucleic acid excision enzymes, thus providing selection pressure for the virus strain to produce high pathogenicity when it enters a new host.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt to the host.</seg>
<seg id="285">Therefore, it is no accident that three new types of HCoV have emerged in the past two decades.</seg>
<seg id="286">The coronavirus does not cause disease or mild symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They replicate in large numbers and do not cause a strong host immune response.</seg>
<seg id="288">This is why there are asymptomatic carriers and cases of serious human infection.</seg>
<seg id="289">Serious symptoms are mainly due to the over-activation of the immune response and cytokine storms, so the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung injury will be.</seg>
<seg id="290">In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from coronavirus replication.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy of delinking the immune response may play a positive role in anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="292">The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="293">Therefore, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, there are defects in the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory body in bats.</seg>
<seg id="295">Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammatory body may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is based.</seg>
<seg id="297">Although bat β-CoV has been found to be 95% nucleotide homologous with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that is up to 96% nucleotide homologous with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although beavers and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified.</seg>
<seg id="299">At present, pangolin β-CoV, which is clearly homologous with SARS-CoV-2, has been found, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts, or that pangolin β-CoV may have contributed genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally man-made.</seg>
<seg id="301">Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus has once again become the focus of attention.</seg>
<seg id="302">The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the origin of HCoV human-animal co-morbidity and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">There is ample evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="304">Given that the SARS-CoV infection originated from the contact between humans and fruit beavers on the market, closing the wet goods market and killing fruit beavers can effectively end the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">Similarly, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin β-CoV closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolin should be removed from the wet goods market in order to prevent the spread of human-animal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolin and other mammals remains to be further studied.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in single-hump camels for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for local people.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">Therefore, it is impossible to follow the example of the Chinese wildlife market in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and sacrifice all camels to control MERS.</seg>
<seg id="311">In order to stop the re-outbreak of MERS, comprehensive measures should be taken in conjunction with other infection control measures to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camels.</seg>
<seg id="312">As we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge, leading to an outbreak of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="313">Various human and animal co-morbid coronaviruses circulate in the wild.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, there is a high diversity of bat coronaviruses with the potential for human-animal co-morbidity.</seg>
<seg id="315">These human-animal co-morbid coronaviruses have many opportunities for evolution and recombination, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more likely to spread and/or be fatal in humans in the future.</seg>
<seg id="316">In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="317">After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should formulate better prevention and response plans.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They stay in their natural hosts until there is a chance of spillover.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although bats have many characteristics conducive to the spread of the virus, if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wild species, human exposure to bats and other wild species will be greatly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="321">In order to better understand the ecological status of coronavirus and its natural hosts, it is necessary to continuously monitor mammals, which will prove to be very useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="322">In short, the most effective way to prevent viral human-animal co-morbidity is that humans should stay away from the ecological niche of the natural host of human-animal co-morbidity virus.</seg>
<seg id="323">There are still several shortcomings in the mystery of the origin of human-animal co-morbidity in SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolin, it makes sense to examine the circumstances under which bats and pangolin can share the same ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="325">Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans come into contact with bats remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="326">Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolin.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the case of bats, pangolin or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent virus will be found in natural hosts in the future.</seg>
<seg id="329">Continued research in this field will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.</seg>
