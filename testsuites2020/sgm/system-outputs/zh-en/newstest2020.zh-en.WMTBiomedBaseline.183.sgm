<seg id="1">B'COVID-19 is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, to help track close contact and to identify individuals ("exposed") who may be exposed to the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">A number of applications have been developed or introduced in some regions and jurisdictions with the support of official governments.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many of the frameworks for the development of close contact tracking applications have been put in place.</seg>
<seg id="4">Privacy issues also raised a number of concerns, in particular the need for some systems to track the geographical location of application users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less intrusive alternatives include the use of blue doses to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that this function in support of blue teeth applications would be directly integrated into an amateur and / or operational system.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the Government has jointly developed an application to support citizens to check for themselves whether they have been in contact with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">The procedure is currently in use in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has introduced an application called TraceTous.</seg>
<seg id="9">This application, developed locally by the IT community, will be released as an open source software and handed over to the Government. North Macedonia introduced a "StopKorona!" Application based on blue teeth to track potential patients' exposure</seg>
<seg id="10">The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Health of Northern Macedonia.</seg>
<seg id="11">By 14 April 2020, the application was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 12 April, the Government announced that the close contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and would be operational in the coming weeks. Ireland and France also planned to launch similar applications ("StopCovid").</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on Singapore's TraceToace application and BlueTrace agreement. Russia plans to introduce a geo-fence application for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering, University of Cambridge, cited possible practical problems in the application system, including false misrepresentation, and possible lack of effectiveness if only a small proportion of the population used the application.</seg>
<seg id="15">To put an end to the spread of misleading or harmful "coronary virus" applications, apples limit the type of organization that can publish coronary virus-related applications in apple application shops, that is, "good."</seg>
<seg id="16">Similar restrictions have been applied in Google and Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy defenders stated that they were concerned about the use of coronary virus applications for mass surveillance and, in particular, whether the surveillance infrastructure set up to respond to the coronary virus epidemic should be dismantled after the threat of disease.</seg>
<seg id="18">AI and more than 100 other organizations have called for such surveillance to be restricted.</seg>
<seg id="19">These organizations have announced eight conditions to be met for government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";</seg>
<seg id="21">Monitoring and surveillance expansion must have a sunset clause;</seg>
<seg id="22">The data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes only;</seg>
<seg id="23">Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there must be evidence of effective protection;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in accordance with the law;</seg>
<seg id="26">Safeguards must be provided to prevent data abuse and citizens must be provided with the right to respond to data abuse;</seg>
<seg id="27">All "relevant stakeholders" are required to "participate effectively," including public health specialists and marginalized groups. The German Mixed Computer Club (ICC) and Reporter ohne Jourzen (RSF) also published a verification list.</seg>
<seg id="28">The proposed Google / Apple plan is intended to address ongoing surveillance issues and to remove them from the equipment operating system once tracking is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some countries used web-based rather than application-based location tracking, which users did not need to download, while avoiding being tracked.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Web-based solutions with access to raw location data may have serious privacy problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with a central server have access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that communicate with one another using a central server alone have been created (see below for further details).</seg>
<seg id="33">Korea has introduced a system that is not based on applications to carry out the contact tracking mission.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using specialized applications, the system selects to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile equipment tracking data and credit card transaction data, which can then be combined to send notifications to potential infected persons through short messaging.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government has been granted access to location information, as the information privacy law has been significantly modified following the outbreak of the MERS epidemic in the country.</seg>
<seg id="36">This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, are considering using centralized systems and privacy protection systems simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="37">As at 6 April 2020, no specific details had been published.</seg>
<seg id="38">Privacy protection close contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a large number of relevant research literature dating back to 2013 at least. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups are studying privacy protection solutions, such as blue low (Ble)</seg>
<seg id="39">PEPP-PT is a coordinated programme with a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single agreement. Decentralized agreements include decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-ppt / DP-3T), interim contact number (TCN).</seg>
<seg id="40">Under these agreements, identifiable personal data will never leave the equipment and all matches will be made on the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Privacy Group of the Media Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or road cross-data to track COVID.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Platform is based on the development of a white paper entitled "Application robustness: Protecting the privacy of individuals in an outbreak," published in March 2020. In addition to this, a similar technology development company was created and committed.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to support users in sharing sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.</seg>
<seg id="44">By 5 April 2020, groups had jointly formed the Global TCN Alliance around essentially identical methods and fundamentally overlapping agreements, with the objective of reducing debris information and supporting the global interoperability of tracking and alarm applications, which was a key.</seg>
<seg id="45">On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that its official government application was based on the source BlueTrace agreement.</seg>
<seg id="46">On 10 April 2020, Google and Apes, respectively, which control the Artistic and Mobile Platform, announced a close contact tracking plan, claiming that it combines blue and low-power technologies with privacy protection plus. Privacy</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, they have published core technical norms used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">Apple and Google stated that the system was planned to be rolled out in three phases:</seg>
<seg id="49">Introduction of tools to support the Government in creating official coronary virus tracking applications that protect privacy</seg>
<seg id="50">In this system, Google and Apple are first rolled out through operational system upgrades, and the system will be removed in the same way after the outbreak threat, thus addressing follow-up surveillance issues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is an act of cleaning the hand for the removal of dust, oil resin, microbial or other useless substances on hand.</seg>
<seg id="2">Insisting on washing with soap at some of the "critical moments" daily can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, all of which can be transmitted through dung.</seg>
<seg id="3">People may also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or general influenza, if they do not wash hands before they come into contact with their eyes, nose or noise (i.e. membrane).</seg>
<seg id="4">Five key moments in a day that must be washed with soap: Pre- and post-defecation, baby-cleaning, baby-feeding, pre- and pre- or post-poultry handling.</seg>
<seg id="5">If soap and water are not available, the wooden ash can be used to clean the hand. The World Health Organization recommends washing the hand in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after food preparation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Care for patients before and after.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the replacement of urine or cleaning of children such as toilets.</seg>
<seg id="9">After nasal T, cough or spraying.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching animals, animal foods or animal faeces.</seg>
<seg id="11">Manual hygiene of medical personnel refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand-washing before prescription or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the medical field, the main purpose of hand-washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms that may cause disease) and chemical substances on hand that may harm the human body.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hand-washing is particularly important for those engaged in food processing or in the medical field, but it is also a very important practice for the public.</seg>
<seg id="15">The health benefits of hand washing include minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;</seg>
<seg id="16">And reduce infant mortality at home.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices contributed slightly to an increase in the height of children under five years of age.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory systems and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by promoting simple behavioural change (e.g. washing hands with soap).</seg>
<seg id="19">This simple act can reduce the death rate of the above-mentioned diseases by almost 50 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">The promotion of hand-washing interventions can reduce the incidence of approximately one third of diarrhoeal incidents, with the effect of providing clean water in low-income areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hand washing with soap can reduce diarrhoea by 48 per cent. As a spontaneous practice in households, schools and communities around the world, hand washing with soap is the most effective and acute respiratory.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, as a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, killing approximately 1.8 million children every year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">UNICEF indicated that making pre- and post-toilet washing with soap ingrained habits save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention could reduce diarrhoea deaths by almost one half and acute respiratory deaths.</seg>
<seg id="25">As part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) project, other sanitation interventions are usually undertaken while promoting hand-washing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing can also prevent septipes transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hand washing has a minor adverse effect that frequent washing leads to dry skin, causing skin damage.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand washing led to skin tampering, fracture, known as hand-wet measles or pneumonia, which was particularly common among health-care workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Excessive and frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of forced disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">To reduce animal-oral transmission of the disease, it is necessary to wash the baby with soap at five key moments of the day: After toilet (urine, defecation), after cleaning the child's butt.</seg>
<seg id="31">In order to prevent the spread of disease, hand washing should also be done in the right way: Before or after the cut or wound; after spraying, cough or nose aldicarb; after touching.</seg>
<seg id="32">The rate of hand washing with soap is low in many countries / regions.</seg>
<seg id="33">A study in 2015 on hand-washing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7 per cent of households had the lowest hand washing daily. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Basic Health Care Plan introduced by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the core of this national plan is the annual deworming, supported by daily hand washing with soap and tabletting with fluorine.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Indonesia, the programme has also been successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="37">The incorporation of soap or cleaning agents into water would allow for better removal of micro-organisms in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main role of soap and cleaning agents is to reduce dissolved barriers and increase solubility.</seg>
<seg id="39">The use of water alone cannot effectively clean skin, as fat and protein (integral parts of organic soils) are not easily soluble in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, clean washing requires reasonable water...</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soap may remain in bacteria from previous use because it can be reused.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies have investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap and have concluded that bacteria cannot be removed because bacteria can be washed off by foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, CDC continued to claim that "it would be preferable to use non-contact liquid soap."</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial soap has been strongly promoted in a healthy mass.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that antibiotic resistant micro-organisms in the natural environment have been selected using the recommended antibacterial or disinfection agent.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as trichlorfon, which has a large number of resistant microbial strains.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, antibacterial soap may not be as effective as propaganda, even if it is not chosen for antibiotic resistant strains.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to surface active and protective agents, complex formulations may also contain acid (acetic acid, antiblood acid, emulsium acid) as a pH regulator, toxicological acid, and more skin effects.</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water washers are comfortable, but their calories are not sufficient to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria breeds rapidly at body temperature (37 Â° C).</seg>
<seg id="51">However, soap water is more efficient than cold soap water in the removal of natural oils containing soil and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Scientific studies have confirmed that the use of temperate water has no effect on the reduction of micro-organisms on hand, contrary to the prevailing view.</seg>
<seg id="53">Hand-free or decontaminated hand-washing is a non-hydraulic hand cleaning agent.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-hydraulic hand cleaning agents (also known as alcoholic gloves, decontaminated gloves or hand-washing) were popular.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most of the formulations of these washing fluids contain isopropropanol or ethanol and are added to dense agents, such as Kapam polymers, for use in hydraulic fluids.</seg>
<seg id="56">The addition of diluted hydroxide can further increase antibacterial activity. Free hand-washing fluids containing at least 60 to 95 per cent of alcohol can be effective in microbicides.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol and cellular fluids can kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (methylene pelagic wine bacteria (MRSA), hepatitis (VRE), tuberculosis</seg>
<seg id="58">Bacterial content 70% of alcohol and cell use 30 seconds can kill 99.97% of bacteria (reduced by 3.5 quintiles similar to 35 minutes). Hand 1</seg>
<seg id="59">Viruses (the most common cause of gastrointestinal infections) such as viruses (noroid, or Norwalk) are almost completely non-effective from alcohol or hand-hand fluids. Adequate bacterial use</seg>
<seg id="60">Washing of hand and hand back and hand fingers and all fingers at the end of the finger will be about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or concrete changes.</seg>
<seg id="61">The finger must also be fully cleaned and the tip washed on the two height. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the best hand washing rather than using hand-free gloves.</seg>
<seg id="62">Due to their ease of use and the rapid loss of vitality of micro-organisms, they are increasingly being used; however, they should not be a substitute for correct hand washing unless soap and water are available.</seg>
<seg id="63">The frequent use of alcohol free of hand-washing can lead to dry skin unless wear and / or moisture are added to the formulation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Glycerine and / or other dry agents may be added to the formulation in order to reduce or eliminate the dermal drying caused by alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, free hand-washing of alcohol containing wet agents can significantly reduce skin irritation and dermal drying compared to soap or bacterial cleaning agents.</seg>
<seg id="66">Cases of allergic contact with skin, exposure and measles syndrome, or additive sensitization in alcohol or alcohol are rare.</seg>
<seg id="67">Alcohol is less likely to induce irritating contact pneumonia than hand washing with soap and water, which is one reason for its attractiveness.</seg>
<seg id="68">Water-free cleaning agents, while effective, do not remove organic substances from their hands, but only decontaminate them.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thus, free hand-washing is less effective in preventing the transmission of many pathogens than soap and water, as these pathogens are still on hand.</seg>
<seg id="70">The efficacy of alcohol-free hand-washing depends to a large extent on the composition and formulation, which has historically been much less effective than alcohol and alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="71">More recently, the formulation of the use of benzhlordecone has been proven to be persistent and cumulative antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be less effective after reuse, possibly due to skin</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use wooden ash or soil substitutes.</seg>
<seg id="73">Wooden ash or soil is more effective than hand washing with separate water, but not as soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One problem is that if soil or woody ash is contaminated with micro-organisms, the spread of disease may be accelerated rather than slowed.</seg>
<seg id="75">As with soap, grass ash is also a sterilizer, as it generates alkaline solutions when it comes to water.</seg>
<seg id="76">Who suggested that soap could be replaced with wooden ash or sand if soap was not available.</seg>
<seg id="77">The correct hand washing steps recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="78">Moisture with dried temperate or cooled water.</seg>
<seg id="79">The flow of water is recommended because of the potential for contamination of staging basins, while water temperatures do not seem to be relevant.</seg>
<seg id="80">A sufficient amount of soap is used repeatedly to wash up to produce foams while cleaning hands, fingers and fingerprints.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap can remove bacteria from the skin, and research has shown that people often wash hands more thoroughly when washing with soap rather than with separate water.</seg>
<seg id="82">Rinse at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Washing can create friction, which helps remove bacteria from the skin, the longer the washing time, the more bacteria are removed.</seg>
<seg id="84">Fully cleaned with fluid water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Water basin washing can lead to re-contamination.</seg>
<seg id="86">Strip or natural drying with a clean turban.</seg>
<seg id="87">Hand moisture is more likely to be re-contaminated. Thumb, hand wire, hand-finger area and hair-seam are the most frequently neglected places.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial fingerprints and fractured finger oils may hide micro-organisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">It is generally recommended that wet milk be used to avoid manual drying; skin drying leads to damage to the skin, thus increasing the risk of transmission.</seg>
<seg id="90">Where access to piped water and / or soap is not available in developing countries, low-cost measures are available to facilitate hand washing, for example, through a barrel or spawning water, and where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="91">The technique of simple hydraulics is simple, with a pipe mounting a water tank and then turning a small amount of water into the hands through a fetch plate and reusing soap.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effective handcuffing is an important step in the manual health process, but there is some debate about the most effective way of doing it in public health.</seg>
<seg id="93">An increasing number of studies have shown that paper scarves are healthier than electric dry mobile phones provided in many toilets.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, carried out a study sponsored by the European Step Research Institute (European tissue) in the headscarf industry, comparing the headscarf, warm dry and more modern.</seg>
<seg id="95">After hand-washing, a heating dry hand drying hand was found to have increased the total number of fingerprints by 194 per cent and the number of hand-held bacteria by an average of 254 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="96">On the other hand, the total number of hand-held bacteria increased on average by 42 per cent and the total number of hand-held bacteria increased by 15 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="97">Hand washing leads to an average 76 per cent reduction in the total number of fingerprints and 77 per cent reduction in the total number of cervical bacteria. Scientists have also conducted tests to determine whether dry methods may.</seg>
<seg id="98">Spray handphones are said to spray air at 180 m / s (650 km / hour; 400 miles per hour) to blow off microorganisms on hand and on the machine, which may contaminate health workers and other facilities. 2 m</seg>
<seg id="99">The use of warm dry phones can spread micro-organisms to areas other than dry phones of 0.25 metres.</seg>
<seg id="100">The results of the use of paper turban drives indicate that there will be no serious microbial transmission. In 2005, TÃV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess different dry methods.</seg>
<seg id="101">The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after dry hands:</seg>
<seg id="102">The study involved a large number of different handphone producers who compared them with those with paper scarves.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the absence of soap and water during travel, hand washing using hand-sterile wet turban is the option.</seg>
<seg id="104">Alcohol should be free of hand-washing at least 60 per cent of the alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="105">In 1846, the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis found that hand washing was effective in preventing the spread of disease in the hospital, but only after a very long period of time the medical staff was required.</seg>
<seg id="106">The hospital uses electronic equipment that provides feedback in order to alert hospital staff when washing their hands.</seg>
<seg id="107">One study found a decrease in infection rates as a result of the use of these devices.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical staff wash up at least 15 seconds and hand-washing uses sufficient soap and water or concrete to produce foam and wash all parts of the hand.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hand-held fingers are intertwined.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there are residues between seams, they can be removed with rigid scrap.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since there may still be bacteria remaining on hand, they must be adequately cleaned and stripped with a clean turban.</seg>
<seg id="112">After abrasions, the headscarves should be used to close the taps (if necessary, to open the export doors).</seg>
<seg id="113">This prevents re-contamination of the hand as a result of exposure to these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">In health institutions, the purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic micro-organisms ("bacteria") and to avoid transmission.</seg>
<seg id="115">Reports in the New England Medical Journal indicate that, in most medical settings, hand washing does not reach acceptable levels and that large numbers of medical personnel often forget hand washing before reaching patients, leading to microbial transmission.</seg>
<seg id="116">One study showed that proper hand washing, together with other simple procedures, could reduce the prevalence of vascular-related infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a questionnaire that demonstrated standard hand washing and hand methods.</seg>
<seg id="117">The organization also publishes a draft manual on manual hygiene on its website for public comment.</seg>
<seg id="118">A related overview was made by Whitby et al.</seg>
<seg id="119">If there is a need to verify compliance, commercial equipment can measure and validate hand hygiene.</seg>
<seg id="120">Who recommends "five moments" of hand-washing:</seg>
<seg id="121">After exposure to blood / body</seg>
<seg id="122">Before and after detoxification</seg>
<seg id="123">After taking care of the patient. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap ("soap" or "bacterial soap") can cause microbicides by hand-washing agents.</seg>
<seg id="124">Such microbial operations may be required in an environment prior to operation or in which there is a high number of antibiotics-resistant microbial organisms. "Friction" hands for surgical purposes must be used without exposure.</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewellery is taken.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing the hand, the front arm and up to the elbow, usually for two to six minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">Prolonged washing is not required (10 minutes).</seg>
<seg id="128">When washed up, water from the front arm must be prevented from flowing back to the hands.</seg>
<seg id="129">After washing, use of sterile friction drives and wear surgical clothes.</seg>
<seg id="130">In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, it is advisable to wash hand or use hand-free microbicides before and after exposure to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="131">In order to control vinelosis infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from cleaning the cell comes from the 20 per cent washing frequency, with very limited further benefits when the frequency increases to more than 35 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="132">Compared to the use of bacterial soap, the use of common soap washing leads to a threefold increase in the proportion of bacterial infections transmitted to food. The use of alcohol or hand fluids is compared</seg>
<seg id="133">However, there are more effective interventions to reduce pistol-type H1N1 influenza (HIN1enza A) and hard-to-light bricks (Clostrip difficile).</seg>
<seg id="134">Further research is needed on what interventions are most effective in various medical settings.</seg>
<seg id="135">Hand washing with soap is considered to be an important cost-effective tool for achieving physical health and even good nutrition in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes universal hand-washing a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even where hand-washing stations are built at low cost, hand-washing is rare in the vicinity of every private or public health clinic.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be due to deep-rooted customs, rather than to a lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and advocating the use of soap washing can influence policy development, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term behavioural change among the population.</seg>
<seg id="140">To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are essential.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based methods were effective in increasing hand-washing rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMIs), while social marketing activities were less effective. An example of clean schools</seg>
<seg id="142">When minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star to the top three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">Hand-washing campaigns may include the construction of hand-washing stations to reduce disease and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">Another example of hand-washing activities is World Lwashing Day, which seeks to bring about behavioural change. The United Nations Children's Fund has promoted the use of a hand-washing slogans due to.</seg>
<seg id="145">Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing and the avoidance of disability adjustment years (DALY) in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="146">However, reports indicate that the promotion of hand washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.</seg>
<seg id="147">The earliest recognition of the importance of hand-washing to human health - in particular for those with weak health (for example, mothers who have just given birth in hospital or wounded soldiers) is the pioneer in the field of health in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="148">At that time, most people still thought that the infection was caused by the malicious odour known as poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The outbreak of dietary diseases and medical infections in the 1980s prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to become more active in promoting cell hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">The 2009 pig influenza outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand-washing with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, German washing ponds in public health rooms, office buildings and airport toilets are sighted with "correct hand washing methods" posters.</seg>
<seg id="152">The classical term "washing does not work" means that a person declares that he or she is unwilling to be responsible for or not willing to participate in a particular matter.</seg>
<seg id="153">It derives from the Evangelical Evangelical of the Bible, and Pontius Pilate washed hands after deciding on the death of Jesus and later evolved into a wide range of English-speaking.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Sababiya's McNee, McWhite started forced washing hands in an attempt to cleanse the premeditated spots, demonstrating her guilt in the crimes she committed and encouraging her husband to commit.</seg>
<seg id="155">Research has shown that those who want or envisage immoral behaviour tend to wash hands more frequently than others and often value hand-washing facilities more often.</seg>
<seg id="156">In addition, those who can wash hands when immoral behaviour is envisaged are unlikely to engage in other "purification" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">Religion requires hand washing for sanitary and symbolic purposes. Toilet washing, but not symbolic washing with soap, is part of many religious symbols, including Baha'i faith, Hinduism (</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing after toilets.</seg>
<seg id="159">Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikh, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronary virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) has so far caused many deaths in China and other regions 80</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to the virus SARS-CoV - which in 2003 led to the infection of thousands of people with SARS - SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19 are lower than those of SARS, they are more widespread and affect more older persons than young people, with more men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In view of the rapid increase in new pneumonia-related publications, this paper is intended to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving research topic.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will present basic knowledge on epidemiology, pathology, viruses, diagnosis, treatment, pre-treatment and prevention of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this overview will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The spring of January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and ingrained memory of Chinese, and the outbreak of a new virus disease forced all to leave the entire holiday and several weeks thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="8">The virus is highly homogenous to the coronary virus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named 2020 V2, 11. SARS</seg>
<seg id="9">The epidemic began in Vukhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country, then spread to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="10">By 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in over 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases, of which more than 40,000 had been hospitalized and more than 3,000 had died.</seg>
<seg id="11">Who Warning COVID-19 has become the "front-line enemy," a threat that may outweigh terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to data published in the PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), the first report of the virus has been released from multiple patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">The purpose of this paper is to summarize the progress of research in this emerging subject area.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV - Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss the knowledge gained so far with regard to the prevention and anticipation of the disease, as well as some urgent issues that remain to be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">CoV has been considered a non-lethal pathogen to humans in the past, causing about 15 per cent of the general feeling.</seg>
<seg id="17">But this century has seen two highly pathogenic categories of CoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, outbreaks in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012 respectively, rapidly spreading to many other countries with terrible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thus, this COVID-19 outbreak is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in Figure 1, Vukhan first reported a number of cases of unexplained pneumonia to the National Health Board of China on 31 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the sequence of CoV was published.</seg>
<seg id="21">The first case of death was reported in Wuhan on 15 January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the epidemic rapidly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On 20 January, an infection was reported among health-care personnel, suggesting that there might be an artificial phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="24">On 23 January, the city of Wukhan was closed and all public transport was closed.</seg>
<seg id="25">On 24 January, according to the first clinical study on new coronary pneumonia, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Vuhanhuan Seoul market, which was considered the starting point.</seg>
<seg id="26">On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency."</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of publication of the present report, the disease had spread throughout China and close to 50 countries around the globe (figure 2 (Fig.2)).</seg>
<seg id="28">Owing to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and magnitude of the outbreak has yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">In February 2020, a multi-centre study for 8,866 patients (including 4,021 diagnosed COVID-19 patients) provided an update of the epidemic, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="30">SARS-CoV-2 is available to all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7 per cent) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age and only 14 were under the age of 10.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 are more infected men (0.31 / 10,000) than women (0.27 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 Concentrated dissemination mainly in the northern lake and surrounding areas.</seg>
<seg id="34">COVID-19 Average time from morbidity to diagnosis 5 (2-9) days.</seg>
<seg id="35">The average lateness period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">The average time between morbidity and mortality is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.</seg>
<seg id="37">Basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of infected persons increased exponentially by 23 January 2020, in line with the time of mass population movements prior to the spring of China.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality rate for confirmed cases is 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and for all patients 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (60 years) and severe pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">CoV is a large meningitis family with a single justice chain RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They may be divided into four groups, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and Tex, of which al- CoV and beta-CoV are known to be infected with humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV encapsulated sugar protein (S) with its cell isotopic stress conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2) and diphetaminated 4 (P4)</seg>
<seg id="44">Viruses RNA genome is released into cell form; after its replication, the genome RNA, together with sugar proteins and nuclear cartridge proteins, formed the virus and then merged with the organism.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV, with gene consistency exceeding 99.98 per cent of 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China Seas market in Vukhan.</seg>
<seg id="47">In contrast to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genologically similar to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the molecular shopping of the human gas through the diameter.</seg>
<seg id="49">The study found that the person ACE2 was the subject of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, in comparison to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S protein and human ACE2 is weaker, which corresponds to SARS-CoV-2, which causes infection less serious than SARS</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also form new types of short protein coded by orf3b and endocrine protein coded by Orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role and inhibit the expression of IFNBa; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional structure area or sequence.</seg>
<seg id="53">By 18 February 2020, Zhou et al. Reported on the cryo 2.9-EM structure of the refrigerated electronic magnetometer (cryo-EM) of ACE2, the full length of the complex with ammonate.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that the compound had open and closed configurations and was assembled into two poles, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins to provide evidence of co-identification and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may be the target point for screening drugs to contain SARS-CoV-2 infections.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and intermediate hostels</seg>
<seg id="57">As is well known, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate in bats and are transmitted to humanity through fruit and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">Through SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV system development, bats are considered to be the natural hostel of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is consistent with the two BAT-VAT BV -</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it is not clear what middlemen help the virus become infected with human beings across the species barrier and the pathways of transmission are yet to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="60">JI et al. Raised the issue of smuggling from bats to people living with the virus, which involved the reorganization of congeners within S protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China considered that one of the most commonly found CoV and SARS-CoRS, 99 per cent, given that it was used in mountainous - a long diet.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the difference of 1 per cent between the two genome remains significant; as a result, decisive results are yet to be provided with concrete evidence (Fig.33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The rational nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.</seg>
<seg id="64">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 Â° C and 40-50% moisture.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="66">SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be thermally sensitive to ultraviolet and - 56 Â° C 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine sterilants, peroxyacetic acid</seg>
<seg id="67">The general lack of human immunization against SARS-CoV-2 makes this new virus susceptible.</seg>
<seg id="68">At present, there are no detailed studies on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoV, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure (Fig.4) 4).</seg>
<seg id="70">Generally, the virus is first identified by the host's intrinsic immune system (PRR) following the invasion of the host, including C type concrete sample receptor, Toll sample receptor (TLR).</seg>
<seg id="71">The virus is induced by inflammatory factors through different routes, tree cell maturity and the combination of type I disturbance (IFN), which can limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the penetration of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help to lift the virus out of the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="73">Adaptive immunization promises to join the fight against the virus in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="74">T lymphone cells, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, play an important role in anti-virus defence.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4 + T cell irritation B cells produce viral isomers, while CD8 + T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="76">Auxiliary T cells produce hepatitis cell factors to help these defensive cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, CoV can stifle T-cell function by inducing T-cell abatement.</seg>
<seg id="78">Liquid immunizations, including supplementation, such as C3a and C5a - and antibody resistance, are also critical in the fight against HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibody separation from rehabilitated patients can be mediated and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of liberal foundations, which can cause serious damage to lung and other organs and, in the worst case, to multi-organ failure or death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2, characterized by concentrated morbidity, is more likely to affect older persons with multiple syndrome, as well as pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">Typically, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impairments of the immune function are more likely to be infected than others.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to a study of the earliest 425 cases in the city of Vukhan, the average latent period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average latent period of 3 days and a range of 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that, based on demographics of 8,866 cases, the probability period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="86">For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective length of isolation to the most accurate latent periods so as to prevent the transmission of the virus to others by persons suffering from symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, people exposed to or infected with the virus usually need to be segregated for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the length of isolation be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">Heat is usually the main and first symptoms of COVID-19 and can be accompanied by no other symptoms, including dry cough, air, muscle pain, dizziness, hair, hair.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients experience respiratory difficulties and / or low oxygen anaemia one week after the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="91">Severe people are rapidly progressing into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic fumes, metabolic acid poisoning and concrete function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="92">Even in the absence of lung imaging anomalies, patients with hot and / or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should undergo viruses screening for early diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98 per cent fever, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent respiratory difficulties, 3 per cent diarrhoea and 8 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar results have been reported in two recent studies on the incidence of family agglomeration and the incidence of molestation caused by symptoms of individual transmission.</seg>
<seg id="95">In contrast, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients were also mainly affected by heat (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and respiratory difficulties (55 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80 per cent of these patients require ventilation support, far more than COVID-19, in line with MERS's higher mortality rate than COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Diarrhoea (26 per cent) and swallowed pain (21 per cent) were also observed among MeRS patients.</seg>
<seg id="98">Among SARS patients, hot fever (99% - 100%), dry cough (29% - 75%), respiratory difficulties (40% - 42%), diarrhoea (20 - 25%) and swallowed pain</seg>
<seg id="99">By 14 February, the global number of COVID-19 cases had reached 66,576 and the mortality rate was 2 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="100">By comparison, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10 per cent in 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate for 2,494 confirmed cases was 37 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="102">In an early study, SARS-CoV-2 R0 high 6.47, 95 per cent confidence zone (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2.</seg>
<seg id="103">Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a proliferation capacity higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter.</seg>
<seg id="105">Control of SARS-CoV-2 is therefore more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">Concentrated morbidity usually occurs in the same household or from the same gathering or means of transport, such as cruise ships.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients usually have travel or residence history in Vukhan or other epidemiological areas, or close contact with infected persons or patients, within the last two weeks prior to their illness.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, it was reported that people could carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and that cured patients who were out of hospital could again bear the virus, thereby alerting them to prolonged periods of isolation.</seg>
<seg id="109">The number of blood cells (especially lymphoid cells) is normal or decreasing in the early days of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, white cell count &amp; LT was found among 1,099 COVID-19 patients; 4 x109 / L - including lymphocylene cell count &amp; LT; 1 x109 / L reduction.</seg>
<seg id="111">Increases in liver and muscles in blood and muscle protein levels are observed in some patients, most of them with higher blood C reactive protein and blood deposition.</seg>
<seg id="112">High blood fibre protein degradation products are observed in heavy patients with higher D-II polymers and a decrease in lymphic cell count.</seg>
<seg id="113">The majority of COVID-19 patients are exposed to anomaly in the chest, characterized by two-sided films or lung glass.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients usually experience atypical pneumonia, acute pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="115">In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammatory conditions, liquid accumulation and sexual fibration can seriously impair the exchange of gases.</seg>
<seg id="116">Skin cell function disorders in type I and type II lung bubbles reduce surface activity levels and increase surface weight, thus reducing lung expansion capacity and increasing the risk of lung landslides.</seg>
<seg id="117">As a result, the worst chest imagery usually coincides with the greatest severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">By 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 found pneumatic cell decontamination in the lung of a patient who died of the disease, transparent membrane formation, mesosal</seg>
<seg id="119">Test SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the RCC Reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, since a higher probation rate is likely to accelerate the epidemic, China began diagnosing clinical performance on 13 February 2020 (instead of relying solely on RT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="121">A similar situation occurred during the diagnosis of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="122">Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical performance, laboratory examinations and photographic results is essential for effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">By 14 February 2020, the top team had reported a programme using Sherlock technology based on CRISPR, 10 SARS-CoV-2, which did not require complex instruments and used a test paper for less than one hour.</seg>
<seg id="124">If validated in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience in treating the new type of CoV, doctors mainly support COVID-19 patients while attempting to use or propose other CoV - e.g. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV - and others</seg>
<seg id="126">These treatments include current and potential treatment methods such as antiretrovirals, immunosuppressors, opioids, plasma, poisoning and psychological support for rehabilitated patients.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is even recommended that the plasma of the rehabilitated patient be used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibiotics and vaccines against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">SARS-CoV-2 initially attacked primarily the lung and, to a lesser extent, other organs of ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidney.</seg>
<seg id="130">Nevertheless, respiratory disorders and failure are the main threats to patients and the leading cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="131">Respiratory support is therefore essential for mitigating symptoms and saving lives, including conventional oxygen adsorption, high flow oxygen, non-ventilation and creative ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive support from the ECMO, an improved cardiovascular bypass technique to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and sepsis and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.</seg>
<seg id="134">It is well known that the disproportionate response of the immune systems of SARS and MERS patients leads to cell-induced storms.</seg>
<seg id="135">IFS-cell storms are a form of pneumatic reactions characterized by a range of cell factors, including TNFpha, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNpha, IFNCP.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cell factors can induce immune cells to release large amounts of free base, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunosuppressing is crucial in the treatment of cell storms, especially among severely ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="138">Leather-cool and pearl monograph - a resistant IL6 monograph - have been used to treat cell storms.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immunosuppressive treatments for cell storms include: Regulation T cell targeted immune response; interruptions IFN-gamma, IL-1 and TNF; depression Jak; Bombasal resistance;</seg>
<seg id="140">Ethanol is widely used as an immunosuppressor to treat SARS in order to mitigate the severity of the damage caused by inflammatory conditions.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, large doses of solid anol do not contribute to severe lung damage among SARS and COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="142">On the contrary, they can have serious side effects, particularly haemorrhagic fractures, which seriously affect the anticipation.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nevertheless, short-range treatment of high-risk diseases COVID-19 patients with low and medium doses of dermal solid anol is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, the existence of effective ART had not been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, it has been found that Ridseau - a nucleotide analogy - intravenous drugs are effective against a CVID-19 patient in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="146">Redsey, a new antivirus drug developed in Gilide, was initially used to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.</seg>
<seg id="147">It was later proved that Ridsewe could contain other single chains of RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">For these reasons, Gilide has made the drug available to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, the results of which are expected.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms have been recommended in Bareksnie, alpha-disturbance, Losenabe / Litonavibe and Libevin.</seg>
<seg id="150">Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur as a result of co-treatment in Lopenawe / LitonowÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interaction between these treatment methods and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma and antibiotics of rehabilitated patients</seg>
<seg id="153">It is a long history for patients recovering from infectious diseases to collect blood for the treatment of other patients with the same diseases or to protect healthy individuals from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="154">In practice, rehabilitated patients usually contain relatively high levels of resistance to pathogens in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antiquities are an immune protein (IG) generated by B lymphic cells to counter pathogens and other isomers, which identify and directly confront unique molecules in pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this rationale, blood plasma was collected from a group of rehabilitated COVID-19 patients and then injected into 10 high-risk patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours, while pneumonia and viruses were found to have decreased and oxygen saturation had increased.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, before special heterosexual therapy is developed, there is a need for validation and clarification to suggest methods that can be used on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, given the effects of treatment, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, resistance can excessively stimulate immune reactions and cause cell factors to release syndrome, a toxic response that can endanger life.</seg>
<seg id="161">Antibody concentrations in blood are generally low, while plasma demand for treatment of high-risk patients is high.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is difficult to develop and produce heterogeneity resistance sufficiently quickly to confront a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Thus, it is more critical and practical to remove B cells from the body of the rehabilitated patient and to identify genetic passwords for effective antibody coding, or to screen effective antitics against the protein necessary for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="165">In China, TCM has been used to treat multiple diseases for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, the effectiveness of their treatment depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple components in the prescription, which differs in the diagnosis of diseases based on the TCM theory.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and validate such components or their optimal combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, due to the lack of effective and heterogeneous treatments for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from severe.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, it has been found that optical detoxification caps and incineration pest caps are effective for COVID-19 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="170">In several provinces of China, 87 per cent of patients use TCM treatment, with the highest treatment rates observed for COVID-19 patients, including sugar (63.7 per cent), ningia (50 per cent) and Lakes</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other influences, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="172">On 18 February 2020, Zhang Due and his colleagues published a study on the comparison of Western drugs (WM) for individual treatments with WM and TCM.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the time required for WM + TCM group temperature restoration, symptoms disappearance and hospitalization was significantly shorter than the pure WM group.</seg>
<seg id="174">The most impressive is that the symptoms of the WM + TCM group (from light to heavy) are significantly lower than pure WM (7.4 per cent versus 46.2 per cent) and WM is equally lower.</seg>
<seg id="175">Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of TCM still need to be confirmed by better quality exposure tests, greater scope and more centres.</seg>
<seg id="176">Recognition of the role mechanisms of TCM treatment or its combinations and, where possible, articulation of their effective components will also be of concern.</seg>
<seg id="177">Most of those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 are extremely frightened by this highly contagious and even lethal disease, as well as isolation, isolation and anger.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, oxygen deficiency and cough, as well as poor responses to treatment, such as sleep caused by pyrozol, can increase anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="179">A range of psychological responses were reported in the early stages of the outbreak of SARS, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic behaviour, mental activism, psychiatric symptoms, adventurism and even suicide.</seg>
<seg id="180">As part of the public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19, mandatory close contact tracking and segregation increases anxiety and guilt with regard to the effects of transmission, isolation and stigmatization on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams to avoid close contact through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, using specialized electronic equipment and applications.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines are critical to interrupting the transmission chain from animal hostels and infected persons to vulnerable ones and are often used as a complement to anti-virus treatment in controlling emerging virus-induced epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="184">Industry has made efforts to develop a S-protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and effective intermediate and antibody and / or protective immunization against SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">The detoxification vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, prior to the initiation of clinical research, the internal effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in old age and lethal assault models, as well as their role in protecting human and animal co-infection with the virus, had not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.</seg>
<seg id="188">By contrast, sporadic cases and concentrated infections persist in the Middle East region and spread to other regions due to the persistence of a common source of human and animal disease in the affected areas.</seg>
<seg id="189">Vaccination strategies against MERS, some of which have been evaluated in animal models, have been developed through the use of living viruses, DNA particles, virus carriers, nanopes, virgin particles and the restructuring of protein.</seg>
<seg id="190">The development of safe and effective vaccines for non-immunized individuals, targeting SARS-CoV-2, is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging owing to the long time required for vaccine development (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in CoV.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a new type of disease, COVID-19 has just begun to demonstrate its complete clinical process among thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, the patient can be gradually rehabilitated with no sequelae.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has high morbidity and mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="195">Therefore, the establishment of pre-treatment models for the disease is essential for health-care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="196">According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be prematurely related to COVID-19 patients (Table33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age is the most important factor affecting the advance of SARS, as is COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">As noted earlier, COVID-19 was mainly found in the 30-65 age group in a study that included 8,866 cases, of which 47.7 per cent were over 50 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have basic syndrome and complications and are significantly older than those who do not need it (median age 66 to 51), indicating a predicted age of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="200">Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men than women are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31 / 10,000 to 0.27 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="201">Syndrome and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart damage and heart disorders.</seg>
<seg id="202">Heart incidents are also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="203">It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be combined with ACE2 positive fibre cell, which could lead to liver malfunctions among COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is noteworthy that age is closely related to, and may affect, underlying diseases.</seg>
<seg id="205">Laboratory results are abnormal: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammatory or organizational impairment and is considered a potential predictor of disease, treatment response and eventual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">It was also suggested that CRP levels were relevant to the severity of COVID-19 and the predetermined existence.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, elevated mammoxate (LDH), winter ammonia transfer enzymes (AST), AST (ALT) and muscle acid laser (ck) may also help predict.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.</seg>
<seg id="209">As a result, they are traditional signs of heart or liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="210">Main clinical symptoms: The timing of chest imaging examinations and clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict the occurrence and complications of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="211">Use of stomethanol: As previously mentioned, it is an immune inhibitor and is usually used as a supplementary treatment for infectious diseases in order to mitigate the severity of the damage caused by inflammatory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="212">As large doses of dermatol are widely used in heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from ischaemic bones, leading to lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Therefore, if needed, pyrocline should be used in the case of COVID-19 patients with small doses and short periods of time.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As noted earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under great stress because they were often subjected to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of relatives and friends.</seg>
<seg id="215">Psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients escape stress and return to normal life.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from those of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to reproduction in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated effectively in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or symptoms at an early stage of infection, similar to V Co.</seg>
<seg id="218">As a result, the infection generates a large number of viruses in the course of day-to-day activities at an early or latent stage of the disease, which makes it very difficult to control the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, the spread of SARS-CoV is considered to occur at a time when the patient is seriously ill and most of it does not occur at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="220">Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more serious and difficult to control than in SARS.</seg>
<seg id="221">China is currently making great efforts, including the blockade of Wukhan and surrounding cities, as well as the continued isolation of almost all the population, with a view to interrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="222">While these measures have caused serious damage to China's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the pace of the epidemic is slowing down.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and that the decline phase will last 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, other experts were less optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Paul Hunter et al. Estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more infectious than SARS and will not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">IRA Longini et al. Have developed models to predict the consequences of the epidemic, arguing that SARS-CoV-2 may be infected with two thirds of the global population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A Canadian team reported that patients who had been rehabilitated and discharged two weeks ago had been detected in their nose and swallowed, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, with the decrease in the number of new cases, China has shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.</seg>
<seg id="229">Ebola was predicted to cause 100,000 cases and 50,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="230">However, through strict segregation, the disease is eventually controlled.</seg>
<seg id="231">Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases may weaken and eventually disappear or become less pathogenic viruses living with humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig.55).</seg>
<seg id="233">SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and can be transmitted by cough or spraying, even through direct exposure to articles contaminated with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus is also found in the faeces, increasing the likelihood of its spread.</seg>
<seg id="235">A recent study, which included 138 cases, indicated that 41 per cent of cases could have been caused by indoor infections, including 17 patients previously suffering from other diseases and 40 medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="236">Therefore, more intensive preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health-care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have been in contact with the patient or the infected.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of protection that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks; the use of surgical and N95 dust masks (1860s series) contributes to controlling transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks prevent liquid drip from potential infected persons from spreading in air or being clouded to the surface of articles that may be transmitted to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only N95 (1860s series) masks prevent inhalation of viruses ranging from 10 to 80 NM, with only 5% of the viruses fully penetrating; SARS-SAV-2.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since the virus particles can even penetrate five overlapping surgical masks, health-care personnel in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks rather than surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear separate clothing in order to further reduce exposure to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="242">The virus can also be transmitted from the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">By 22 January 2020, a doctor had contracted SARS-CoV-2 while wearing N95 masks; the virus could have entered its body through a hepatitis eye.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or glasses when facing patients.</seg>
<seg id="245">For the general public in areas affected by or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people use sterilized soap washers more frequently than at normal times, keep themselves as isolated as possible and limit contact with potential.</seg>
<seg id="246">Three feet is considered to be the right distance from the patient.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, on the basis of deep memories of the 2003 outbreak of SARS, it was reported on 7 January 2020 that it was a high alert to SARS.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, as of 19 January 2020, the Director of the Vukhan Disease Prevention and Control Centre continued to reassure the population that the new virus was less infectious, had limited human potential and that the epidemic was preventable.</seg>
<seg id="250">The news clearly lowered public vigilance and, at the dawn of the spring, missed key nodes of containment of the epidemic in Vukhan.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's disease control agencies are likely to learn from this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, these institutions should (1) be more cautious when issuing pronouncements, since each word is critical to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) seek to be more sensitive and responsive to outbreaks from hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="253">COVID-19, caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, began at the end of December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">At the time of writing, in less than two months, it had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="255">Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 appears like SARS.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">More older persons than young people are affected by COVID-19, more men than women, and the severity and mortality of older persons is higher than that of young people.</seg>
<seg id="258">SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="259">Even in the absence of symptoms, COVID-19 transmits the virus, while SARS usually transmits the virus when the condition is serious, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">Among some COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 regular RNA results may be negative.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, cured patients may return to the sun again.</seg>
<seg id="263">These findings significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">Considering that the study on COVID-19 is so fast, the following key issues remain to be addressed:</seg>
<seg id="265">What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?</seg>
<seg id="266">Although 96 per cent of genotoxicity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the bats SARS sample CoV, we are unable to reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.</seg>
<seg id="267">What animal is the transmission of the virus from the original hostel - assumed bats - to the middleman of humanity?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off the means of transmission and there is a risk that outbreaks may recur at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Although molecular models and bio-chemical analyses have proved that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how can the virus accurately enter turbine cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Is the virus also associated with the cell of ACE2 in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the epidemic last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus genetically advance in the course of human transmissions?</seg>
<seg id="274">Would it become a global pandemic? Would it disappear like SARS? Would it revert to it on a regular basis, as in the case of influenza?</seg>
<seg id="275">It is important to find answers to many of these and other questions, but it may take longer.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore normalcy to our lives.</seg>

<seg id="3">The human source version of the enzyme is commonly referred to as hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cardiovascular stress conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc metal enzyme in the inner cell and other cell surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="5">ACE2 protein consists of a N-end pentachlorophenol M2 structural area and a C-bottom collection trin kidney ammonium acid transporting protein structure.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single-molecular protein whose enzyme structure is exposed to the cell surfaces of lung and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another enzyme known as sheddase separates the outer cell structure of ACE2 from the terra-musical structure, releasing soluble protein into blood and eventually excreting into urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes, mainly lung II lung bubble cells, intestinal dermal cells, most organ pulses and intravenous cells.</seg>
<seg id="9">ACE2 mRNA expression has also been found in brain skin, fingerprint, undercover and brain.</seg>

<seg id="15">As a cross-membrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for some coronary viruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (leading to SARS virus); and SARS-Co2</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2011-2020 coronary virus epidemic is a continuing epidemic of 2019 new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19), triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The current outbreak in Vukhan, China, in December 2019 confirmed that 1 January 2020 was recognized as a public health emergency of international concern and 11 March 2020 as an epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">By 10 April 2020, an estimated 161,000 COVID-19 cases and 97,000 deaths had been reported in 210 countries and territories globally,</seg>
<seg id="4">Treatment amounted to 364,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mortality rate in China is about 4 per cent, while in all regions of the globe it is between 0.08 per cent (New Zealand) and 13.04 per cent (Algeria).</seg>
<seg id="6">Common symptoms include fever, cough and haste.</seg>
<seg id="7">It may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="8">The probability period from exposure to morbidity ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no vaccine or specific anti-virus treatment programme.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinical treatment focuses on symptomatic support treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, cough shopping, safe distance from others, surveillance of suspected infections and self-segregation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Official State agencies have responded with regard to travel restrictions, isolation, curfews, hazardous workplace controls and facility closures.</seg>
<seg id="12">The epidemic has had a severe impact on the global socio-economic situation, with the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, exacerbated by panic shopping.</seg>
<seg id="13">Global 193 countries and territories have national or local discontinuation measures, affecting some 99.4 per cent of primary and secondary school students.</seg>
<seg id="14">There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian descent and appearance groups and groups in regions with severe epidemics as a result of the spread of false virus information online.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, reduced travel and heavy industrial closures have reduced air pollution indices and reduced carbon emissions.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 31 December 2019, the health sector in Vukhan, Province of Hubei, China, reported an unexplained case of pneumonia and launched a survey in early January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most of these cases are related to the wholesale market in the South China Sea and, as a result, new coronary viruses are considered to be common to humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to bats' coronary virus, mountainous coronary virus and SARS-CoV. 2012</seg>
<seg id="19">Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were confirmed to be linked to the South China Seat market.</seg>
<seg id="20">An unconfirmed increase in the number of cases reported outside of the Republic of Korea on 13 March 2020 was reported by the Republic of Korea. The first case may be traced back to November 2019, with 55-year-old males.</seg>
<seg id="21">There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially minor cases.</seg>
<seg id="22">By 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among adolescents, with only 2.4 per cent globally aged 19 and under. The British Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Wallens, estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the population needed effective immunization.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number of cases refers to the number of persons tested by COVID-19 and confirmed positive under official programmes.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of 23 March, no more than 3 per cent of the total population had been tested worldwide, and many countries had issued official policies for people not to be tested for minor diseases, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="25">A study published on 16 March indicated that, as of 23 January, 86 per cent of the estimated COVID-19 infections in China had not been tested and that 79 per cent of recorded cases were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="26">A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the actual number of infections in Italy was far higher than the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">The basic transmission (R0) of COVID-19 was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is likely to be 5.7 R0.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most COVID-19 patients can be rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The period between morbidity and death of insolvent patients is 6-41 days, with 14 days being the most common.</seg>
<seg id="31">As at 10 April 2020, some 970,000 people had died from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">As of 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths in China were among those over 60 years of age and 75 per cent were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official statistics refer to new cases.</seg>
<seg id="33">Actual COVID-19 deaths may well exceed statistics, as they may not include undetected patients, such as those who die at home, in nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times higher than the number of deaths from neoponous pneumonia in official statistics.</seg>
<seg id="35">A female spokesman for the CDC in China spoke: "We know that [the number of deaths published] is below the actual figure," and anecdotal stories about the underestimation of United States data attest.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first case of death outside China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February and the first case outside Asia in France on 14 February.</seg>
<seg id="37">As at 28 February, there were more than a dozen deaths outside China, in Iran, the Republic of Korea and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">As at 13 March, more than 40 deaths had been reported in all continents except Antarctica. Several methods were often used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="39">These figures vary from region to region and vary over time and are influenced by detection levels, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the first outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status. Incidence of death</seg>
<seg id="40">According to statistics from John Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as at 10 April 2020 was 6.0 per cent (97,039 / 1,617,204).</seg>
<seg id="41">Morbidity and mortality rates vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the estimates of the disease mortality rate decreased from 17.3 per cent (the number of confirmed deaths between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (the number of deaths diagnosed) (the number of deaths after 2 months). Measures</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics are time-bound and track the entire process from infection to case resolution for specific populations.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many scholars have tried to calculate these data for specific populations.</seg>
<seg id="45">The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-based Medicine estimates the overall rate of infection mortality in the epidemic to be between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="46">The range estimate ceiling is consistent with the first random test conducted by Germany for COVID-19 and a statistical analysis study of the impact of testing on CFR estimates.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization claims that the epidemic is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="48">Peak outbreaks and final duration are uncertain and vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni from the State University of Bong states: "If not controlled, outbreaks of infectious diseases tend to stagnate after the depletion of existing dormitories and then begin to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it is almost impossible at this time to reasonably predict when the abduction will occur. "</seg>
<seg id="51">The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Chonanama, believes that an end to the epidemic in June can be expected if all countries mobilize and adopt the recommendations of the World Health Organization to take measures to halt the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On 17 March, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "could be repeated for a period of one to two years."</seg>
<seg id="53">Neil Ferguson, a study led by the Empire Institute of Technology, states that "physical distance and other measures are essential before vaccines can be used (possibly 18 months or longer)."</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner from the University of Vanderburg stated: "The coronary virus is very widespread and I do not think it is likely to disappear completely" and "may evolve into a seasonal disease that breaks."</seg>
<seg id="55">The severity of the re-outbreak depends on the immune power of the group and the level of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-heterogeneous and some of the infected may have no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory fluids (blood), sniper loss, stick, muscle and shock pains, head pain, cold, vomiting, diarrhoea</seg>
<seg id="59">The CDC classifies respiratory distress, continuous chest pain or stress, sudden perception blurred, hard awakening and face or mouth lips as acute symptoms; if they occur, they are recommended for immediate medical.</seg>
<seg id="60">Some infected persons may have no symptoms and no clinical symptoms, but the results are positive, and researchers therefore recommend close observation and examination of close contact with diagnosed patients to exclude the possibility of infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">China estimates that the rate of invalids varies from very low to 44 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="62">Latent periods (time interval from infection to morbidity) are generally between 1 and 14 days; 5 days are the most common. Uncertainty can be illustrated by an example: COVID-19 patients were estimated to have lost 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details of the pathway have not yet been determined.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is considered that the disease is transmitted mainly through close contact and foam from cough, spraying or talking; close exposure refers to intermittent 1-2 metres (3-6 feet).</seg>
<seg id="65">The study found that cough failure could result in the most distant transmission of foam 4.5 m (15 feet) -8.2 m (15-27 feet).</seg>
<seg id="66">It was also suggested that the long time spent in air by the foam generated at the time of the statement could also lead to the transmission of the virus. Although the virus is usually not transmitted by air, people may also produce bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="67">This foam may fall into the environs' nose and may even be inhaled into the lung.</seg>
<seg id="68">Medical procedures such as injection and cardiovascular recovery (CPR) may aerosol respiratory endocrine, leading to air transmission.</seg>
<seg id="69">In addition, if a person touches the surface of the virus, including skin, before touching his or her eyes and nose, it may also lead to the transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through excreta, but this risk is considered to be low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese Government denies the possibility of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 excreta. The virus is the most contagious in the first three days of the disease, but also contagious before and after it.</seg>
<seg id="72">Positive results can be detected at the earliest three days before the onset of the disease, indicating that the new coronary virus is already contagious prior to a clear symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="73">Despite the low number of reported cases of symptoms diagnosed by laboratories, a number of countries have found symptomatic infections in the course of contact-tracking surveys.</seg>
<seg id="74">The European Centre for Surveillance and Control (ECDC) indicated that although the transmission power of the neo-coronary virus is not yet fully clear, general 1 people will be infected between 2 and 3 people. The virus</seg>
<seg id="75">Specifically, new coronies are known to survive for up to three days on plastics (polypropene) and 304 less steel, one day on paper and four hours on copper.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, their lifetime is also affected by humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals COVID-19 have been tested positive.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is currently no evidence that animals will re-transmit the virus to humans, but official British agencies have advised people to wash their hands after exposure to animals, just as they are exposed to the surfaces of other potentially infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="78">SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, first separated from three pneumonia patients from a group of acute respiratory diseases in Vukhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the relevant coronary virus in the natural world. The virus can be eliminated with domestic soap, since RS is able to dissipate the virus.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is now considered to be a co-disease in humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis shows that this coronary virus is genetically associated with the beta-coronary virus in Sarbeco and submarine (B-B) and two bat-source groups of virus strains.</seg>
<seg id="82">New coronies are consistent with other bats' coronary virus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at a level of 96 per cent of the whole genome.</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that in some parts of the genome sequence there was a difference between the virus in mountains and the virus in human body, only one ammonium acid.</seg>
<seg id="84">A comparison of the entire genome to date found that a maximum of 92 per cent of the genetic material between the mountain coronary virus and SARS-CoV-2 was not sufficient to prove that the dress was an intermediate.</seg>
<seg id="85">The virus can be initially diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but ultimately only through the RRT-PCR (RRT-PCR) or CT imagery of the infected endocrine.</seg>
<seg id="86">A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan shows that CT is clearly more sensitive than PCR, but is less heterogeneous and that many imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and disease development processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of March 2020, the American Radiation Society recommended that "CT is not suitable for screening COVID-19 or as a first test for diagnosing the disease."</seg>
<seg id="88">The World Health Organization has now published several programmes for the detection of nuclear acidification in SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was launched on 17 January.</seg>
<seg id="89">Nuclear acid testing uses real-time reverse polymers chain reaction (RRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="90">Respiratory or blood samples can be used for testing.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results are generally available within a few hours and days.</seg>
<seg id="92">In general, this testing is done either by nose or by swallowed. Many laboratories and companies are developing seropositive tests for the detection of antibody resistance.</seg>
<seg id="93">As at 6 April 2020, none of these tests had proved sufficiently accurate to allow widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the United States, seropositive experiments developed by Cellex have been approved for use in emergency situations only in a validation laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="95">Typical imaging features of X and computer stratifier scanning (CT) for the sick include the asymmetry of grinding glass and the absence of chest stomach.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiology Institute is compiling an international online database on the image performance of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">There is limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19 for images that are not confirmed by PCR due to their re-association with other viruses, such as breast virus.</seg>
<seg id="98">A large Chinese study comparing chest CT results with PCR results found that although images were less specific to the detection of infection, detection was faster and more sensitive and could therefore be considered as a means of screening for endemic areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">A molecular neurological network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to jointly use X and CT to test the images of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="100">Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good hygiene practices, hand washing, avoidance of unwashing to touch directly the nose of the eye, cough or jet with paper scarves, and direct loss of paper scarves</seg>
<seg id="101">Persons suspected of being infected should wear medical surgical masks when they enter public places.</seg>
<seg id="102">Measures to maintain physical distance are also recommended to prevent transmission of the virus. Many Governments have restricted or recommended that travel to and from countries and regions affected by the epidemic be avoided when unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has now reached a community transmission stage in most parts of the globe.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus is spreading within the community and that some community residents are not aware of where or how they are infected. Health care providers who come into contact with suspected infections should take standard precautions, exposure prophylaxis and exposure</seg>
<seg id="105">The use of mobile phone positioning data by the Government for tracking purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations, such as Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for such monitoring to be restricted.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile applications have been put into use or entered into proposals for voluntary use, and by 7 April 2020, over 10 expert groups were working on solutions with privacy protection functions, such as the distance between users of blue dental records and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="107">Once in close contact with COVID-19 patients tested positive, the user receives a reminder of the information. Misinformation about prevention of infection continues to spread; such as washing nose and washing is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">There are currently no COVID-19 vaccines, but many organizations are actively developing them.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is recommended that the spread of disease be prevented by hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="110">CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and running water up to 20 seconds, especially after toilets or visible sludge on hand, before meals, and after inhaling nose, cough.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is because, before entering the human body, the virus can destroy its protective blast by using household soap only, thereby contributing to its extinction.</seg>
<seg id="112">The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-containing hand-washing fluids with at least 60 per cent alcohol if there is no soap or running water.</seg>
<seg id="113">The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="114">The object surface can be sterilized with multiple solvents (sterile fluids can become effective within one minute of the less steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1</seg>
<seg id="115">Other solutions (such as benzaline and chlor-alkali) are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC recommends that if new coronary virus suspected cases or confirmed cases occur in facilities such as offices or day-care facilities, all areas should be decontaminated, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, common equipment</seg>
<seg id="117">Who recommended that people wear their slogans or paper towels in cough or spraying and immediately dispose of all contaminated towels.</seg>
<seg id="118">Persons suspected to be infected are advised to wear medical surgical masks, as wearing masks reduces the amount of foam called when speaking, spraying and cough and reduces the distance of transmission.</seg>
<seg id="119">The World Health Organization has issued a note on the conditions and methods of use of masks.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Virturer Stephen Griffin of the University of Lyz believes that "masks can reduce the tendency of people to find themselves, which is also a major source of infection in the absence of toilet."</seg>
<seg id="121">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that healthy populations should wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for COVID-19 patients, although the organization also recognized that mask wearing helped to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="122">Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="123">The CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical masks made with plastics. China explicitly recommends that healthy citizens also wear one-time medical masks, especially in the range of 1 m (3 feet).</seg>
<seg id="124">Hong Kong, China, proposes to wear masks when using public transport or entering crowd densely populated areas.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials advised people to mask themselves and cleanse them every day.</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech Republic and Slovakia are forbidden from wearing masks or from hitting nose into public places.</seg>
<seg id="127">On 16 March, Viet Nam asked all people to wear masks in order to enter public places in order to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the Government of Austria, all persons are required to wear masks when entering miscellaneous stores.</seg>
<seg id="129">Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.</seg>
<seg id="130">Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million hooden days since mid-March, and 1 April has begun to require masks to be mounted in train and inter-city buses.</seg>
<seg id="131">Panama made it mandatory to wear masks and advised that the masks could not be purchased from the residents themselves.</seg>
<seg id="132">The cover has also been widely used in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Infection prevention and control measures relating to social distance (also known as physical distance) are aimed at minimizing close human contact and thus reducing the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="134">Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension from school, shutdown of work and closure of stadium, theatres or shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="135">Measures that individuals can take to maintain social distance include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas, switching to non-contact interrogation methods and maintaining physical distance to others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Many Governments have now made it mandatory or recommended that social distances be maintained in areas affected by the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="137">With regard to the size of the largest crowd, United States Government agencies and WHO initially recommended 250 people (in areas not covered by COVID-19), which was quickly reduced to 50 and later to 10.</seg>
<seg id="138">In March 2020, Germany banned more than two people from public gatherings. "It was recommended that the elderly and those with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and impairment of the immune system should replace."</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the term "social distance" has the implication of requiring people to be completely isolated from society and does not encourage other ways of maintaining human connections. Some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines applicable during the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendations included sexual intercourse only with partners living with and without viruses or symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="141">Recommendation COVID-19 Identify people living with and suspected to be infected in their homes for self-segregation.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on correct self-segregation. Many Governments have imposed or recommended self-segregation on the entire population of the affected areas.</seg>
<seg id="143">The most severe self-segregation instructions were also issued to high-risk populations.</seg>
<seg id="144">If it is possible to have access to COVID-19 patients, or to countries or areas where widespread transmission has occurred in the near future, it is recommended that they be separated from the last possible exposure of the virus for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="145">Epidemic prevention strategies include containment / containment and mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="146">Containment applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolating infected persons, along with other measures of infection control and vaccination, to stop the spread of the disease to other populations.</seg>
<seg id="147">If the spread of the disease is not contained, efforts should be made to move to a mitigation phase: Measures to slow the spread of the disease and to reduce its impact on health systems and society.</seg>
<seg id="148">Containment and mitigation measures can go hand in hand.</seg>
<seg id="149">Containment requires even more extreme preventive measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic regeneration to less than 1 per cent. Part of the effort to control outbreaks of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which we know.</seg>
<seg id="150">This would reduce the risk of the collapse of the health service system and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programmes.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-drug interventions to control the epidemic include individual preventive measures, such as handcuffing, masks and self-isolation; community-based measures aimed at maintaining physical distances, such as suspension and elimination of mass gatherings; and</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">The Republic of Korea has introduced large-scale screening and localized isolation measures and has issued alerts on the activity trajectory of infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provides financial support for self-segregated infections and imposes a significant fine on those who refuse to separate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="155">Taiwan, China, increased mask production and imposed penalties on suppliers of medical goods that were sold at best. Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States showed significant challenges in mitigating (but not halting the spread of the epidemic).</seg>
<seg id="156">Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak health needs by two thirds, halving deaths, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the breakdown of health systems.</seg>
<seg id="157">Containment may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus ceases to spread among the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever is the case), or if the measure is relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term interventions aimed at curbing the pandemic have social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">No specific antiretrovirals have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">The use of non-prescription impressions, rehydration and rest may help to alleviate symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required depending on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="162">The use of opioid is likely to worsen the situation.</seg>

<seg id="336">From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the impact of embargoes and travel restrictions, this figure includes a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and promote global collaboration in addressing the new coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="337">As the pandemic first erupted in Hubei Province of China, United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Goff and Brazilian President Yayil Bosonaro's son Eduardo Bosonaro addressed the Chinese Government in a manner.</seg>
<seg id="338">Several central (CPC) provincial administrators were dismissed for improper handling of the epidemic in the Central China region, reflecting a central dissatisfaction with the response of the local political institutions to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="339">According to some commentators, this is intended to avoid public dissatisfaction with the recent outbreak of the new coronary virus, which has brought the Central Registrar of China closer together.</seg>
<seg id="340">A number of Chinese officials (such as Zhao Liang) denied the previously acknowledged COVID-19 outbreak of speech in Wuhan and supported the conspiracy that new coronary virus pneumonia originated in.</seg>
<seg id="341">President Donald Tranp of the United States once referred to the new coronary virus as the "Chinese virus" or "Vukhan virus," saying that China's "censorship system" exacerbated the transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="342">The Daiicon received a United States Government telex outlining a communications strategy that was clearly issued by the National Security Council, which states that "all of this is not relevant in China."</seg>
<seg id="343">We were told in any way, including press conferences and television overviews, to disseminate this message as much as possible. "The media such as the Pope, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claim that China provides assistance to endemic countries.</seg>
<seg id="344">The head of European Union foreign policy, Josep Borrell, warned that there was a "geopolitical factor to compete for influence," including through good offices and "generosity politics."</seg>
<seg id="345">Borrel also stated that "China is vigorously advocating that it is a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States."</seg>
<seg id="346">China also called on the United States to lift the sanctions imposed on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and allegedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.</seg>
<seg id="347">On 3 April, the 10,000 masks donated to Cuba by Mayoune were blocked by United States sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="348">The United States authorities are also accused of transferring aid sent to other countries to their own countries.</seg>
<seg id="349">Disputes were also reported between Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as other countries such as the Czech Republic and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="350">In addition, Turkey intercepted hundreds of breathing machines destined for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="351">Early in March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union for its insufficient support for Italy affected by the new coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Italian Ambassador to the European Union, Maurizio Massari, stated: "Only China has responded bilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="353">Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity. "</seg>
<seg id="354">On 22 March, Russian President Putin, in a conversation with Italian Prime Minister Conte, arranged for Russian troops to send military medicine, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Italian newspaper, citing an anonymous "senior political official," stated that 80 per cent of Russia's assistance was "of little use to Italy."</seg>
<seg id="356">The source accuses Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charismatic offensive.</seg>
<seg id="357">The regional governor of Lenba, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media report and expressed their appreciation.</seg>
<seg id="358">Russia has also dispatched a cargo aircraft with medical aid to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="359">The Speaker of the Kerim Palace, Dmitry Peskov, stated: "When providing assistance to United States colleagues, [Beijing] considers that once the United States medical equipment and material manufacturers have resumed their production capacity,"</seg>
<seg id="360">The NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise planned for Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the cold war, will be scaled down.</seg>
<seg id="361">Former Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the defender 2020 exercise: "In the face of a global public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of United States and many European militants."</seg>
<seg id="362">On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Ruhani, wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance. The letter stated that United States sanctions against Iran had prevented Iran from gaining access to the international market and allowed Iran to fight.</seg>
<seg id="363">Political analysts expect that the epidemic may have a negative impact on the possibility of Donald Tranp's re-election to office in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea have also deteriorated as a result of the global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="364">Japan declared that all persons entering the Republic of Korea were subject to a two-week quarantine at a government-designated location, and it subsequently criticized Japan for the vague and passive quarantine measure.</seg>
<seg id="365">Korean society initially showed a polarization of the President's response to the crisis in the Republic of Korea.</seg>
<seg id="366">Many Koreans signed the petition, some called for impeachment c, accusing the Government of improper handling of the epidemic, and others commended his response strategy. The pandemic prompted many countries to adopt emergency legislation to respond to it.</seg>
<seg id="367">Some commentators are concerned that this may lead the Government to tighten control over power.</seg>
<seg id="368">In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of the indefinite inauguration of Prime Minister UrbÃ¡n Viktor and the suspension of Parliament and elections, as well as the punishment of persons found to have spread false information about the virus and government crisis management.</seg>
<seg id="369">Multiple supply shortfalls can be attributed to the outbreak of new coronary viruses, resulting from increased global use of equipment, panic purchases and disruption of plant and logistics operations in response to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="370">The United States Food and Drug Supervisory Authority issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment owing to increased consumer demand and disruption of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="371">High levels of panic shopping have resulted in the empty supply of essential goods, such as food, sanitary paper and bottled water, on the shell.</seg>
<seg id="372">In particular, the science and technology industry has been warning of delays in the delivery of electronic products.</seg>
<seg id="373">According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tsien Tsise, public demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="374">This demand led to a 20-fold increase in the price of such products over average and a delay of 4 to 6 months in the supply of medical supplies.</seg>
<seg id="375">There is also a global shortage of personal protective equipment. The World Health Organization warns that this will pose a threat to health personnel.</seg>
<seg id="376">In Australia, wholesale procurers offer new opportunities to sell Australian products to China.</seg>
<seg id="377">This activity led to a shortage of supermarket infant formula formula, which was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Although COVID-19 was very serious in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, there were no serious food shortages.</seg>
<seg id="378">The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation and illegal trade of key products have been very successful and have averted serious food shortages, which are expected to occur in Europe and North America.</seg>
<seg id="379">Agricultural production did not decline significantly in northern Italy, but industry representatives felt that prices could rise.</seg>
<seg id="380">The empty food shell was only temporary, even in Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.</seg>
<seg id="381">Italy has similar legal provisions requiring food producers to reserve supplies for such emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="382">The damage to the global economy had had an impact on China: A media report of 16 March stated that, in the first two months of 2020, China's economy had suffered enormous shocks and retail sales had fallen by 20.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="383">As mainland China is the world's leading economic and manufacturing centre, the virus outbreak is seen as a major threat to global economic stability.</seg>
<seg id="384">According to Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit, the market will remain unstable until there is a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.</seg>
<seg id="385">In January 2020, a number of analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth could exceed the Athens epidemic of 2002-2004.</seg>
<seg id="386">An expert from the University of St. Louis, Washington, estimated that the impact of the epidemic on global supply chains would be over $3,000 billion, which could last for up to two years.</seg>
<seg id="387">It was reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was "in a difficult position" following a significant drop in oil prices as a result of falling demand in China.</seg>
<seg id="388">On 24 February, global equity markets fell as a result of a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.</seg>
<seg id="389">2-27 February The largest annual decline since the 2007 financial crisis was an increasing public concern about the new coronary virus epidemic, including the NDAQ 100, Standard Per 500 and Due Jones industrial averages, with 191</seg>
<seg id="390">The three indices fell by more than 10 per cent during the week.</seg>
<seg id="391">On 28 February, NRO GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.</seg>
<seg id="392">Public concerns about the new coronary virus led to a further collapse in stock markets, with the largest drop taking place on 16 March.</seg>
<seg id="393">The economic downturn was seen by many as an event of probability.</seg>
<seg id="394">Economists Mohamed El-Erian commended the central banks and states for taking timely and urgent measures.</seg>
<seg id="395">The central bank responded faster than the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="396">Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public places such as tourist destinations and the recommendation of Governments to avoid the impact of travel.</seg>
<seg id="397">As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights as a result of declining demand, including British Airlines, China Oriental Airlines and Australian Airlines, while British Airlines Flybe has unfortunately collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="398">The cruise ship industry has been hit more heavily than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="399">Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been forced to close.</seg>
<seg id="400">The epidemic coincided with the spring season, which was an important tourism season because of China's Spring holiday.</seg>
<seg id="401">The national and local governments have eliminated a range of activities involving crowd mobilization, including the annual spring, and private enterprises have closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong Didiennius and Shanghai Dini.</seg>
<seg id="402">Many New Year of Agriculture events and tourist sites, including the Beijing Palace and the Temple of Temple, have been abolished and closed to prevent large-scale population mobilization.</seg>
<seg id="403">In China, 24 out of 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions extended the new annual leave to 2 months and 10 days, requiring most enterprises not to resume work before that date.</seg>
<seg id="404">These regions account for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.</seg>
<seg id="405">Hong Kong, China, raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, suspended schools for three months and cancelled New Year celebrations. The retail industry was affected globally by reduced business hours or temporary closures.</seg>
<seg id="406">Retail outlets in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="407">Retail outlets in North America and the Middle East declined by 50-60 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="408">In addition, the epidemic has led to a 33-43 per cent decline in passenger traffic from shopping centres in the month of February.</seg>
<seg id="409">Shopping centre operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as increasing health facilities, installing heat scanners to measure the physical temperature of buyers, and eliminating some activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic</seg>
<seg id="410">In January and February 2020, about 5 million people were unemployed in China during the peak of the Wukhan epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="411">There were close to 300 million farmers in China, many of whom were left behind in the interior provinces or in Hubei Province. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans had been unemployed and had applied for government assistance.</seg>
<seg id="412">According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis, the new coronary virus could lead to unemployment of 47 million people in the United States and 32 per cent in the United States. The Indian blockade has resulted in thousands of.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the second half of March, 400,000 French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 100,000 British workers applied for general benefits. Close to 500,000 companies in Germany introduced a government-subsidized reduced working hours for their employees.</seg>
<seg id="414">Both France and the United Kingdom have introduced German compensation for part-time work.</seg>
<seg id="415">The performing and cultural industries have also been hard hit by the epidemic, and the functioning of organizations and employees and individuals around the globe have not been spared.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Arts and Cultural Industries Organization strives to uphold its mission (usually funded by the Government) by demonstrating cultural heritage to the community, preserving the safety of its employees and the public, and supporting artists to the extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="417">By March 2020, museums, libraries, performing places and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and original exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or postponed.</seg>
<seg id="418">In response to this situation, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The epidemic has also recently resulted in many religious services, major sporting events and other social events (such as concerts, concerts, technical seminars)</seg>
<seg id="419">The film industry was also hit. The Vatican announced that it would cancel the holy week to be observed in Rome in the last week of Ramadan, south of Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="420">Many parishes suggest that older Christians stay at home and that places of worship are not used for places of worship; some churches practise worship through radio, online live broadcasts or television, while others allow in-car worship.</seg>
<seg id="421">Other religious groups have also cancelled or restricted gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and places of worship, owing to the closure of churches and churches in the Roman Catholic District and the absence of Christian pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="422">The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the subsequent closure of holy sites, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the Mecca and Metina.</seg>
<seg id="423">The pandemic has caused the worst damage to the world sports agenda since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="424">Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 European championship contests, 2019-20 supercontests, 2020 European championship contests, 2019-20 Nba</seg>
<seg id="425">The outbreak disrupted the 2020 summer Olympic Games planned for the end of July; on 24 March, IOC announced that the games would be "rescheduled to 2020," but not later than 2021.</seg>
<seg id="426">This in turn led to a shift towards online gambling, with several web-based gambling websites reporting a significant increase in their new registrations. The entertainment industry was also affected, and various music groups suspended or cancelled circuits.</seg>
<seg id="427">Many large theatres, such as cyclones, have also suspended all performances.</seg>
<seg id="428">Some artists have also sought to continue producing and sharing works through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live concerts or the creation of a network of "festivals" for performances, distribution and publicity.</seg>
<seg id="429">On the Internet, many networks on the subject of new coronary viruses spread out and, in the midst of uncertainty, many people began to turn to a ghost and attention-shifting approach.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asian and people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="431">Many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have experienced incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred.</seg>
<seg id="432">The numerous reports of February this year (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) document the racist sentiments against Chinese by different groups around the world that Chinese should be infected with the virus or subjected to so-called legitimate reprisals.</seg>
<seg id="433">Anti-Chinese sentiment has also increased in some African countries.</seg>
<seg id="434">It is reported that a large number of residents in the Wuhan and Hubei regions are subject to geographical discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="435">There is a voice, both online and online, to support the Chinese and the inhabitants of the severely affected areas.</seg>
<seg id="436">As the epidemic spread to other hot spots, Italy became the first European COVID-19 country in which populations from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Korea initially signed petitions</seg>
<seg id="437">In Japan, the topic # ChineseDontComeToJapan, launched on Twitter, was widely disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="438">Chinese and other Asian nationals in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing racial abuse and attacks.</seg>
<seg id="439">The President of the United States, Donald Tranp, has been criticized for referring to the new coronary virus as the "Chinese virus," which is perceived by critics as racial discrimination and anti-Chinese tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="440">Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari, carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.</seg>
<seg id="441">Students from north-eastern India (bordering China) and attending major cities in India were also reportedly harassed by the outbreak of new coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Chairman of the Indian People's Party Western Bengal State, Dilip Gosch, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and that "the above empires had to retaliate against them."</seg>
<seg id="443">These statements were later denounced by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as "mistakes." In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents were also exacerbated by the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage,"</seg>
<seg id="444">Many newspapers with pay walls have removed payment wall restrictions for partial or full coverage of new coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="445">A number of epidemiological-related scientific papers have been made public by many scientific publishers.</seg>

<seg id="1">COVID-19 Workplace prevention</seg>
<seg id="2">COVID-19 Workplace prevention refers to the use of dangerous occupational safety and health measures to prevent coronary virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">The appropriateness of risk prevention in the workplace depends on the specific workplace and tasks and should be determined on the basis of risk assessments of exposure sources, the severity of community diseases and risk factors for individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure is the least exposed to the public and other colleagues, and basic infection precautions are recommended, including hand-washing, occupational segregation</seg>
<seg id="5">Moderate exposure risks include the need for regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This includes staff who reach out to the general public, such as schools, high population density work environments and some large retail environments.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should use efficient air filters and spraying protective devices for ventilation, personal protective equipment and other hazardous precautions during exposure to COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA considers that there is a high risk of exposure to health and home staff who are known or suspected to be COVID-19 patients, if the staff member has performed aerosol-generating operations from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hazard control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering control, such as pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The outbreak of COVID-19 could have serious effects in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Staff may be absent because of illness, need to care for others or fear of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="12">There may also be changes in business patterns, including changes in demand for or access to commodities (e.g. purchases during non-peak periods, or the use of delivery or removal services).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, there may be disruptions in the logistics of products from high-risk areas of the COVID-19 epidemic. Plans for the prevention and response of infectious diseases can be used to guide protection actions.</seg>
<seg id="14">These plans address the level of risk associated with various workplace and work tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from family and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plans also outline the precautions needed to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="16">Plans to prevent and respond to infectious diseases may need to be subject to national or local advice.</seg>
<seg id="17">Targets for responding to the outbreak included reducing inter-worker transmission, protecting populations at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the community in which the enterprise operates.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hazard control level is the regulatory framework widely used in occupational safety and health and is used to classify hazard control measures according to effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the hazards of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control and, ultimately, personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering control, which involves separating staff from work-related hazards rather than relying on staff behaviour for control, is also the least cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative control refers to changes in work policies or procedures that require action by staff members or employers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="23">PPE has a less defensive effect than engineering and administrative controls, but helps to prevent some exposure.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of PPE are to be selected according to the hazard level faced by the staff member and must be properly worn (e.g. breathing), regularly inspected and maintained, if necessary to avoid replacement, storage and decontamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">Under the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure is the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is recommended that all workplaces adopt basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, home isolation of sick employees, cough or spraying to follow respiratory procedures, provide paper turban and garbage drums, prepare</seg>
<seg id="27">Timely identification and segregation of potential infectious individuals are key to the protection of workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.</seg>
<seg id="28">The United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that employees with acute respiratory symptoms should be kept in isolation for at least 24 hours until the absence of hot, heat and any other symptoms is determined. Sick leave policy should be flexible</seg>

<seg id="30">Such staff include protective clothing in schools, high-density working environments and high-volume buffers Efforts Intensifying staff members in the general public. Protective equipment for this group and high-risk groups includes ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such staff would ideally need to be equipped with respirators.</seg>

<seg id="34">Gloves and other one-off items should be treated in bio-hazard bags, followed by cleaning and disinfection of contaminated surfaces. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard precautions also include travel</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the segregated room. For schools and child-care settings, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommend that schools be completely closed for short periods of time, regardless of community spread.</seg>
<seg id="36">For medium and low-level community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as elimination of other large gatherings such as field visits, rallies and sports classes, joinder or cafeteria meals, increased office distance</seg>
<seg id="37">In cases of high levels of community transmission, in addition to social distance strategies, extended school breaks may be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform routine routine activities, the CDC considers that they face a lower direct health risk.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who must have access to COVID-19 identify patients or suspected individuals act at the same level of protection as medical first aid technicians, including with appropriate personal protective equipment.</seg>

<seg id="41">Staff at high risk of exposure include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff who are physically exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="42">The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff carry out foam generation procedures for known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process samples of infected or suspected infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="43">Foam generation procedures include plumbing, cough induction procedures, bronchial screenings, some dental procedures and examinations, or pyrology collection.</seg>

<seg id="1">201. Coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">Common symptoms include fever, cough and haste.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle acid pain, diarrhoea, swallowed pain, sniffing loss and diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="4">The probability period from exposure to morbidity ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although most cases have minor symptoms, some of them develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="6">By 17 April 2020, 210 countries and territories worldwide had reported more than 224,000 cases and more than 153,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people are currently treated and rehabilitated. The virus is transmitted mainly between people through close contact, often via cough, spraying or foam generated when speaking.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the call gas can produce foams, the foam usually falls on the ground or on the surface of various objects and does not result in long-range transmission.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, if people touch the surface of the virus and then touch their eyes and nose, they may also be infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virus can survive on the object's surface for up to 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although it is also possible to spread in the pre- and post-recovery stages, the first three days of the disease are the most contagious. The standard diagnostic method is a real-time reversal of the RRT (RRT).</seg>
<seg id="12">People suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="13">The suggestion that the public should wear a mask varies from one place to another, with some authorities opposing the wearing of a mask and others demanding that it be worn.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine or ultra-antivirus treatment programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">The vast majority of countries in all six WHO regions have reported partial transmission of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">People living with the virus may have no symptoms or suspicious influenza symptoms, such as fever, cough, lack of power and haste.</seg>
<seg id="17">Acute symptoms include breathing difficulties, continuing chest pain or chest slurry, vague consciousness, difficult to awakening and face or mouth; in the event of these symptoms, immediate medical attention.</seg>
<seg id="18">A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms, such as spraying, nose aldicarb or throat.</seg>
<seg id="19">A different proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, were also monitored.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some Chinese cases were initially characterized by chest and cardiac symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure and even cause death.</seg>
<seg id="22">We call it a latent period.</seg>
<seg id="23">COVID-19 usually has a latent period of 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">97.5 per cent of infected persons will suffer symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report states that not all infected persons will suffer from symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of persons with symptoms in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully defined; however, there is preliminary evidence that people with symptoms may contribute to the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="26">The proportion of people infected with symptoms has not yet been determined and research is continuing. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Centre (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of confirmed cases showed no symptoms during hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="27">The National Health Council of China has included cases of symptoms in its daily newsletter since 1 April; of the 166 infections at that date, 130 (78 per cent) were tested without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both hydraulic and saline fluids can carry a large number of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="29">Big speech spills more bubbles than normal speech.</seg>
<seg id="30">A Singapore study found that cough-free cough could lead to the most distant transmission of foam 4.5 metres (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">Although such viruses are generally not transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States has determined that they may be transmitted via biosols, and air collectors on off-site corridors have tested viruses RNA positive samples.</seg>
<seg id="32">Medical procedures such as injection and cardiovascular recovery (CPR) may aerosol respiratory endocrine, leading to air transmission.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through faeces, but this risk is considered to be low. The virus is most contagious when the patient suffers symptoms; although it may be transmitted before the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="34">The European Centre for Surveillance and Control (ECDC) indicated that although the transmission power of the neo-coronary virus is not yet fully clear, general 1 people will be infected between 2 and 3 people. The virus</seg>
<seg id="35">Specifically, new coronary viruses are known to survive one day on paper boards, up to three hours in plastics (polypropene) and ruble steel (AISI 304) and 99 per cent in pure products</seg>
<seg id="36">However, their survival times are also affected by humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">If properly used, soap and cleaning agents can also have the effect of extinguishing the virus. Soap products degrade the fats of the virus and render it inactive while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions, such as phenzalmonium and chlor-alkali (an surgical disinfection solution), have been less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China, shows that, on average, saline samples.</seg>
<seg id="39">5 / 6 patients had the highest number of viruses in their first sample and 1 / 6 had the highest number of viruses detected the following day.</seg>
<seg id="40">SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), beginning with three pneumonia patients from a group of acute respiratory diseases in Vukhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronary virus associated with nature.</seg>
<seg id="42">Before the virus enters the human body, it can be eliminated by domestic soap, which can destroy the virus's protective film. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cell via vascular stress conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2), which has the highest concentration of lung type II lung.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus is integrated with ACE2 through a special surface sugar protein called "Tunisia" (particles) into the hostel cell.</seg>
<seg id="45">Of the patients admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, 12 per cent found acute heart damage and a higher proportion of seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="46">Cardiovascular symptoms are more frequent as a result of general inflammatory and immune system disorders as a result of disease deterioration, but acute cardiovascular damage may also be associated with heart ACE2.</seg>
<seg id="47">ACE2 Receptors express and participate in the regulation of heart functions in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="48">ICU is known to have a high incidence of blood boses (31%) and intravenous blood bolts (25%) in care of COVID-19, which may be associated with progneumatic examination</seg>
<seg id="49">Although SARS-COV-2 is inflammatory to the respiratory cells of the adulthood ACE2, COVID-19 severely ill patients are subject to a pneumonia response.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, COVID-19 pathogenic in patients GM-CSF endocrT cells are associated with the collection of hepatitis IL-6 endocrine monomer cells and severe lung pathology.</seg>
<seg id="51">The autopsy report also saw the leaching of lymphone cells.</seg>
<seg id="52">Who has published several disease detection programmes.</seg>
<seg id="53">The standard method of detection is the use of a real-time reverse polymeric enzyme chain reaction (RRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="54">This test is usually tested for respiratory samples obtained through nose swallowed; however, nose gauges or hydraulic samples may also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">In general, results can be obtained within a few hours and two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests can also be performed, but two blood sampling times of two weeks are required, with the result that there is little immediate value.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to separate coronary viruses strains and publish gene sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymeric chain responses (PCR) testing agents to detect infection with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (not only operational infections can be detected, but also individuals who have been infected with the virus in the past) is still under development but has not yet been rolled out.</seg>
<seg id="59">Based on China's experience, the accuracy of testing is only 60 to 70 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="60">On 21 March 2020, the United States FDA approved the first instant diagnostic reagent and became operational at the end of the month. The diagnostic guide issued by the Minan Hospital of Wuhan University sets out a clinical and epidemiological.</seg>
<seg id="61">Early infections are more frequent than lung grinding glass, with asymmetry and backscattering.</seg>
<seg id="62">With the development of the virus, pneumonia can become visible in the chest, gravel signs (lung bubble surpluses to varying degrees with small leaf spacing) and lungs.</seg>
<seg id="63">Very little information is available on COVID-19 micropathological injuries and pathological physiology.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main findings of the autopsy were as follows:</seg>
<seg id="65">Eye screening: Chest meningitis, pneumonia, pneumonia mutation and lungs</seg>
<seg id="66">Four levels of viral pneumonia were observed:</seg>
<seg id="67">Mild pneumonia: Pneumonia, lung cell growth, large numbers of non-typical pulmonary cells, meshepatitis accompanied by lymphoba cell infestation and multi-nuclear cells</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe pneumonia: Contagious pneumonia damage (DAD) is accompanied by contagious pneumonia infiltration.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">Resuscitation pneumonia: Hydraulic seepage of pneumonia and pneumatic fibres</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: Dispersive vascular concrete (DIC); infant-child red cell reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures that can be taken to reduce infection rates include staying at home; avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas; often washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; avoiding</seg>
<seg id="73">The CDC proposes to cover the slogans with paper towels when cough or spraying; if they do not, it is suggested that they be covered from within the mangrove.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is recommended that hand hygiene be properly cleaned after cough or spraying.</seg>
<seg id="75">DC proposes to wear face masks in public places to some extent prevent the transmission of viruses by invalids. The core of social distance strategies is to close schools and workplaces, limit travel and cancel large public gatherings.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, social distance guidelines provide for a minimum of 6 feet (1.8 m) distance in interpersonal interaction.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are no effective drugs to prevent COVID-19. Given that vaccine development is expected to take at least 2021, efforts to reduce the epidemic peak are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, which is known. "</seg>
<seg id="78">At the same time, the DC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and running water up to 20 seconds, especially after toilets or visible sludge on hand, before cooking, and after nose.</seg>
<seg id="79">In addition, it is recommended to use alcohol-containing hand-washing fluids of at least 60 per cent, but only in the absence of soap and running water. For areas where water-free water cannot be purchased, WHO</seg>
<seg id="80">These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydroxide is not a "cell sterilizer."</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerine is added as a moisture preserver.</seg>
<seg id="83">People are provided with support care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and other vital organ support that is affected.</seg>
<seg id="84">CDC recommends that persons suspected of having a virus wear improvised masks.</seg>
<seg id="85">An in vitro film oxygen compound (ECMO) has been used to mitigate the effects of respiratory failure, but its benefits have yet to be studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is recommended to improve immunization by maintaining hygiene and promoting healthy lifestyles and dietary habits.</seg>
<seg id="87">For those with early symptoms, support therapy may be effective. Who and the National Health and Health Council of China launched an initiative calling for proper care of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="88">American experts in critical diseases and lung specialists have compiled and made available free of charge through IBCC the treatment proposals made by various agencies.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, COVID-19 was not developed.</seg>
<seg id="90">In response to certain symptoms, some medical experts have recommended the use of pyrolysis (ethylamidophyl PCP) to replace Blofin for first-line treatment.</seg>
<seg id="91">Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, with particular attention to protection when performing operations that may result in aerosols, such as plumbing or ventilation, in a medical environment.</seg>
<seg id="92">For health-care providers caring for COVID-19 patients, CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure prevention measures and air-borne prevention measures, patients should be transferred to air-borne infectious disease isolation room (AIIR). CDC Summary guidelines</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, it is preferable to use respirators (rather than masks).</seg>
<seg id="94">While N95 masks are authorized for industrial use, FDA has authorized the use of such masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">It is used primarily to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust) but cannot be used for other purposes to ensure effective insulation of specific biological formulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the absence of masks, the DC proposes to use masks and, if necessary, wear self-prepared masks.</seg>
<seg id="97">Most COVID-19 cases have minor symptoms and do not require mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.</seg>
<seg id="98">Health personnel are actively undertaking research aimed at providing respiratory support to COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms. There is evidence that gas injection can be avoided through high nasal-flow oxygen therapy.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is not clear whether the two treatment options are equally effective for seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="100">If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use innovative mechanical ventilation because this technique can also limit the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high flow through nose. Older persons (over 60 years of age)</seg>
<seg id="101">In many developed countries, the number of beds per capita is insufficient and, given medical conditions, the health system is unable to cope with the critical situation resulting from the surge in COVID-19 cases, which necessitates hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="102">A study in China found that 5 per cent of patients were to be taken to a custody room for serious illness, 2.3 per cent to have mechanical ventilation and 1.4 per cent to die as a result.</seg>
<seg id="103">About 30 per cent of COVID-19 admissions in China were eventually sent to ICU.</seg>
<seg id="104">With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) triggered by COVID-19, mechanical ventilation is becoming more complex and oxygen is becoming more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="105">The stress control model and high PEEP breathing apparatus will then be used to maximize the delivery of oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung damage and chest from respirators.</seg>
<seg id="106">Old breathing apparatus may not achieve high PEEP.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research on potential therapies began in January 2020 and a number of antiretrovirals have now entered the clinical trial phase.</seg>
<seg id="108">Ridsewe appears to be the most potent drug at present.</seg>
<seg id="109">Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or have reached the advanced testing stage.</seg>
<seg id="110">Serious patients can experiment with anti-retroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="111">Who Call on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential therapy effectiveness and safety tests. FDA has provisionally authorized the restoration of blood blood transfusions as experimental treatment for life-threatening serious cases.</seg>
<seg id="112">The necessary clinical studies have not been carried out to demonstrate the safe and effective treatment of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="114">Users are required to enter names and identification numbers as required.</seg>
<seg id="115">This application can gauge the potential risk of infection by testing "close contact" with monitoring data.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user may also check the status of three other users.</seg>
<seg id="117">Once a potential risk has been detected, the application will not only recommend self-segregation, but also alert local health officials. Combined use of mobile data big data analysis, face-to-face identification techniques, cellular tracking and human intelligence. Tracking</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security agencies to track mobile phone data on suspected coronary virus carriers.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of this measure is to enforce segregation and protect groups who may be exposed to infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, the German telecommunications and the German federal government agency, Robert Koh Institute, shared the aggregated cell phone location data in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="121">Russia has deployed face-to-face identification techniques to detect persons who violate the rules of separation.</seg>
<seg id="122">According to the Italian Regional Commissioner for Health, Giulio Gallera, data from mobile phone operators "40 per cent of citizens are still moving around."</seg>
<seg id="123">The German Government organized a 48-hour weekend, black Marathon, with more than 42,000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions on a global scale to prevent the spread of the coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="125">Isolation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of self-infection can all be troubling.</seg>
<seg id="126">BBC cites Rory O'Connor's view that "social isolation, isolation, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are perfect storms that harm the mental health and well-being of people."</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease is more moderate, with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as general influenza.</seg>
<seg id="128">Cases of mild illness can normally be recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.</seg>
<seg id="129">According to other similar viruses (e.g. SARS and MERS), pregnant women are at a higher risk of becoming COVID-19 severely ill, but lack data support. COVID-19 may cause pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="130">In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, haemorrhaging or multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">COVID-19 Relevant complications include haemorrhagia, concrete anomalies, and heart, kidney and liver damage.</seg>
<seg id="132">Six per cent of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital had concrete anomalies, in particular the extension of the original gasoline time, while 4 per cent of the group had kidney disorders.</seg>
<seg id="133">About 20-30% of the COVID-19 patients' liver enzymes (transmonia) were elevated.</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time between morbidity and mortality was 10 days, with the average hospitalization time being 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the average time of hospitalization to death for patients transferred to ICU was seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">Early case studies found that the average time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with an overall time range of 6 to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">A study by the National Health Council of China (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for males and 1.7 per cent for females.</seg>
<seg id="138">Autopsy pulmonary samples and the organization's pathological examination indicate that both lungs are subjected to corrosive pulmonary bubble damage accompanied by cell fibre anomalies.</seg>
<seg id="139">Viral cell changes were observed in lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="140">Lung images are similar to those of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">Of the deaths reported by the National Board of Health and Health of China, 11.8 per cent resulted from heart damage due to increased muscle calcium protein levels or heart disruption.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data released in the United States in March, 89 per cent of admitted patients had prior medical history. The availability of medical resources and regional socio-economic conditions could also affect mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="143">Estimates of disease mortality vary according to regional differences and methodological difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="144">Underestimation of cases of petty disease may lead to overestimation of mortality.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, if the death is due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">Compared to non-smokers, smokers have developed a 1.4-fold high rate of COVID-19 seriously ill patients, requiring intensive custody or death rates some 2.4 times higher. Concern was expressed about the long-term legacy of the.</seg>
<seg id="147">The Hospital Authority in Hong Kong, China, found a 20-30 per cent reduction in the lung activity of some of the rehabilitators, with lung scanning showing damage to organs.</seg>
<seg id="148">In addition, rehabilitation may lead to post-partum syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it is uncertain whether past infections will lead to effective long-lasting immunization of the rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="150">Other coronary viruses were identified as potentially immunized, but some COVID-19 cases were reported to be tested positive shortly after rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="151">These cases are considered to be continuing to deteriorate rather than re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="152">The virus is considered to be a natural virus that originates from animals and is infected through spillover.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin has not yet been determined, but by December 2019 the infection was almost entirely interpersonal.</seg>
<seg id="154">The first case study of COVID-19, published by Lancet in January 2020, showed the earliest date of morbidity as 1 January 2019.</seg>
<seg id="155">Who The earliest date of morbidity reported in official publications was 12 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="157">These figures vary from region to region and vary over time and are influenced by testing levels, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the first outbreak of the epidemic and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status.</seg>
<seg id="158">By the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths, and U07.2 to Clinical or Epidemiological Infection COID</seg>
<seg id="159">According to statistics from John Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as at 17 April 2020 was 6.9 per cent (153,822 / 2,240,191).</seg>
<seg id="160">Mortality rates vary from region to region. Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflect the percentage of confirmed cases of disease and the percentage of undiagnosed cases (including confirmed cases).</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are time-bound and track the entire process from infection to case resolution for specific populations.</seg>
<seg id="162">Although not all infected persons are resistant, the presence of resistance provides information on the number of infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="163">The Italian Epidemiological Centre Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with a population of 4600, with 80 people (1.7 per cent) now dying of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="164">In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various fanatical days, even among young people, but mortality is relatively low and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially categorized.</seg>
<seg id="165">In addition, the German medical system is already overburdened.</seg>
<seg id="166">An assessment by blood donors shows that about 3 per cent of Dutch citizens may be resistant.</seg>
<seg id="167">To date, 69 people (0.004 per cent of the total population) have been identified as having died from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the epidemic and mortality rates vary by gender.</seg>
<seg id="169">Studies in China and Italy show that male mortality is higher than female mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="170">Men are at the highest risk of death between the ages of 50 and 60, with only a close gender gap in the age group of 90 years.</seg>
<seg id="171">China has a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent for males and 1.7 per cent for females.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact reasons for this gender difference are unclear, but may be caused by genetic and behavioural factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender-based differences in immunization, the lower prevalence of smoking among women and the lower age at which men experience syndrome, such as hypertension, lead to higher mortality rates among men than among women.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, men account for 57 per cent of infections, and men account for 72 per cent of all deaths due to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the United States Government had yet to track gender-related data on COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="176">Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.</seg>
<seg id="177">The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher, as is the rate of exposure to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="178">On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease "COVID-19."</seg>
<seg id="179">Who leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained: CO represented the "champion," VI on the "virus," D on disease, "19 on the first outbreak of the disease (20112).</seg>
<seg id="180">The name was chosen to avoid the invocation of specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or populations in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigmatization. Introduction of COVID-19 as the virus acute respiratory syndrome</seg>
<seg id="181">In addition, WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "Introduction of COVID-19 virus" in mass communication.</seg>
<seg id="182">Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronary viruses."</seg>
<seg id="183">During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronary virus" and "uterine coronary virus."</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary viruses and disease names, based on the 2015 guidance on the use of location in disease and virus names.</seg>
<seg id="185">Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="186">Given the capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have started printing health-care materials, such as nose watches and respiratory components.</seg>
<seg id="187">For example, an Italian hospital was in desperate need of ventilation valves, with suppliers unable to deliver parts within the required time, a local start-up company performing reverse works and printing the 100 ventilation valves required.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy, misinformation and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were spread rapidly through the network.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">No evidence of the replication of the virus was found in pigs, ducks and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="192">Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research and the development of vaccines and medicines for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity experiment" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing anti-virus compounds that are most likely to produce therapeutic effects.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is no vaccine yet, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="195">As both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through ACE2 receptors, the results of previous work by SARS-CoV need to be used.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three vaccine strategies are being studied.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, researchers plan to develop a full-virus vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">The use of such viruses, both inactive and neonatal, is aimed at triggering rapid human immune response at the time of new infections COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy is to develop subunit vaccines aimed at developing a vaccine that motivates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such research focused on the S-irritation protein that supported the infiltration of the virus into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is the development of a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).</seg>
<seg id="202">The safety and effectiveness of the experimental vaccines developed under the above-mentioned strategies must be tested. In 2020, on 16 March, four Seattle volunteers launched their first clinical vaccine trials.</seg>
<seg id="203">Vaccines contain a non-gene sequence that is replicable from the virus that generates the disease. It has been argued that resistance dependency enhancement can be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="204">By April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.</seg>
<seg id="205">Seven tests have been assessed and approved for malaria treatment, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chlorine quaquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Conversions of antiretrovirals account for the vast majority of Chinese research, with nine third clinical trials on Ridsewee to be conducted in a number of countries by the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing anti-virus drugs are currently being assessed for COVID-19 treatment, including Sedway</seg>
<seg id="208">As of March 2020, the efficacy of the treatment in Ridsewee has been prima facie confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="209">The clinical symptoms of patients treated with compassionate medications were observed to have slowed down.</seg>
<seg id="210">At this stage, the United States, China and Italy are conducting a third clinical trial. In February 2020, China initiated a chlor-alkali (previously used to treat malaria) study and produced preliminary results.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, a call was made for a peer review of the study.</seg>
<seg id="212">The health authorities of the Republic of Korea and China have recommended the use of chlorine.</seg>
<seg id="213">However, the Wuhan Institute of Epidemiology recommended a daily dose of 1 g, reminding that the doses were very dangerous and could even be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="214">By 28 March 2020, FDA had issued emergency use authorizations for chlorine and hydrochlorine, but doctors had the right to decide whether to treat COVID-19 patients. The seventh edition of the Chinese guide also proposed the use.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data indicate that high doses of Libavelin have inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="216">After validating SARS-CoV-2 low concentration inhibitors, further in-vitro studies are recommended using nitazolite. Studies indicate that cross-meningine dioxic acid Co2 (TMRS SS2)</seg>
<seg id="217">There are serious limitations in the studies of chlorine quine and hydrochloroquine, whether combined with Achicoxin or not, which cannot be accepted by the medical community unless further research is carried out. OD-2 Not</seg>
<seg id="218">Cell storms may become a complication of later treatment by COVID-19 seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydrochloroquine may have anti-cell storm properties. Upon completion of a small study, the National Health Council of China included the tapet resistance in the treatment guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="220">Following the positive results of the tests for seriously ill patients, Italy is conducting a national level 2 non-random test.</seg>
<seg id="221">In conjunction with blood and iron protein tests, cell storms are identified with the aim of deterring the development of the disease, which is believed to lead to the death of some of the infected.</seg>
<seg id="222">In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, FDA approved the use of white cell doses to treat other causes of incurable cell factors such as CAR T cell therapy.</seg>
<seg id="223">To date, there has been no random cross-checking evidence that the tapee is effective in treating CRS.</seg>
<seg id="224">The extraction of pure enrichment resistance from COVID-19 rehabilitated immune systems is being studied and injected to people in need as passive immunotherapy prior to successful vaccine development.</seg>
<seg id="225">SARS tried this strategy during the epidemic, but the efficacy of the therapy has yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="226">The virus is and is an expected role mechanism for passive antiretrovirals to guide SARS-CoV-2 immunization.</seg>
<seg id="227">However, other mechanisms such as antibody dependence cell toxicity and / or infestation can achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive antimalarial therapy are being developed, such as the use of man-made mono-cloning resistance.</seg>
<seg id="229">Haemorrhage during rehabilitation is likely to increase to facilitate rapid deployment. The serum consists of the liquid part of the blood of the rehabilitated patient, which includes specific heterosexual resistance to the virus.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australian shops have lowered the maximum number of sanitary paper per transaction</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday, Australia's chains, Woolworth and Coles, reduced the maximum purchase of each traded sanitary paper for all their shops nationwide to two and one package, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">ALDI also introduced a one-size-fits-all restriction on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">These restrictions are posted in the form of news on the bank desk or on the Facebook page of the chain.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was reported that buyers had accumulated goods for fear of COVID-19 in order to prevent them from being isolated.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Woolworth also limited the purchase of sanitary paper for door-to-door delivery to a single package.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prior to these changes, Woolworth and Coles introduced restrictions on four packages per transaction on 4 and 5 March, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="8">In its press release of 8 March, Coles reported that "many shops were still unavailable within one hour of arrival" after the restrictions on the purchase of four bags and that the demand was "unprecedented on Tuesday," ALD</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a Woolworth spokesperson, sales had increased "sharply" last week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last week, the Costco store in Canberra was also limited to two parcels.</seg>
<seg id="11">To further mitigate the shortfall, Coles ordered more packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworth ordered additional stocks, and ALDI prepared inventories in advance for the planned Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said that retailers tried to increase stocks, but the local council restrictions on truck delivery time made this difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expected that production costs would increase as suppliers tried to meet their needs, while preferential activities would be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, ALDI announced that a number of shops would not be able to hold Wednesday preferential events after early release of stocks.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert from the University of Science and Technology of Queensland, stated that stores replenish stocks every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said that sanitary paper was a large item, so that stocks were smaller and that, once sold, huge shell space would be left, exacerbating the perception of a shortage of materials.</seg>
<seg id="17">The view of Coles and Woolworth is that if there is much on the shell, goods like cartridges and hand-washing fluids can be [bought] and in sufficient quantities, you may say Rus. "</seg>
<seg id="18">The manufacturer of recycled sanitary paper, Who Giva Crapb, indicated last Wednesday that they were no longer in stock.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News.com.au, Kimberley-Clark, who produced comfortable and hygienic paper, and Solaris, who made Sorbent sanitary paper, all stressed that they were working round-the-clock.</seg>
<seg id="20">The real estate website Domain.com reported that some real estate vendors offered free sanitary paper to the first bidder at an auction held in Melbourne owing to the small number of auctions that the buyer had to break on weekends.</seg>
<seg id="21">The NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, contains eight pages in its Thursday version to be used as a sanitary paper for scrapping.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to ABC Australia's report of 3 March, shops were initially unwilling to impose restraints, and they stated that they did not plan to impose purchase restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other commodities, including masks, hand-washing, dry, hand-washing and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, outside Australia, Ocado, Online Online UK, limited the purchase of Andrres sanitary paper to two packages on Sunday evening for 12 volumes per package.</seg>

<seg id="3">Theme: [Covid-19] Lightforward to prepare for the future</seg>
<seg id="4">Date / time of transmission: 14 March 2020 at 00: 24 (UTC)</seg>
<seg id="5">Licence: CC0: No rights retained</seg>
<seg id="6">We have experienced some difficult circumstances since this month.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we have a clear sense of solidarity in the destiny of all humanity and of our responsibility to each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We face unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best measures to address them require people all over the world to feel, work together and promote community-building, which is the core philosophy of Wikimedia.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exchange of fraternity and care among all our colleagues by e-mail, telephone and chat is a testament to the distinctive points of our colleagues, who have the privilege of working with you.</seg>
<seg id="10">I am very grateful and proud to be with you.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">Let me be aware of how meaningful it is for the world to use Wikipedia at this time, and of the symbolic power that this vital resource brings to people around the world to maintain its proper functioning.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whether your work is responsible for the operation of the website, the payment of salaries or community safety, the proper functioning of Wikimedia depends on your hard work.</seg>
<seg id="14">More than ever before, the world needs information from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="15">At this stage, the content and even the way in which we work will have an important impact on the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities of our colleagues, we will make some important adjustments to our collaborative approach from next week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Working methods and schedule adjustments</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robyn mentioned earlier, the senior management team met yesterday evening to discuss the company's modus operandi and timetable for the next few days to months.</seg>
<seg id="19">At that meeting, we considered what we believe is an appropriate response to the current challenges facing companies, as well as best practices to ensure that companies maintain sustainable development during the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">The senior management team agreed to relieve pressure on company staff so that they can sustain their support for the company's mission.</seg>
<seg id="21">We support you in properly reducing the pressure on your work.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all employees, contractors and contract workers:</seg>
<seg id="23">Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), subject to subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="24">This adjustment is not a false announcement. If you can work longer on a daily basis, we will have a long assignment to you in accordance with your hours of work.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, given the unpredictable nature of the current world situation, priority will be given to your personal needs, such as care for family members, outdoor shopping or medical consultations.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will not follow your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are ill, let you get down to work.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is self-evident, but we would like to remind you of that.</seg>
<seg id="29">You do not need sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team revise the work calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan, the human and cultural operators, who will support you and ensure that your situation receives due attention from management.)</seg>
<seg id="31">In the case of part-time employees, we will pay them in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already expressed our commitment and reaffirmed our commitment to adhere to the commitments made to contractors and hourly workers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Our pay to all will continue to be calculated on the basis of their remuneration for normal working hours.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even you are ill or unable to work.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are willing to work, we will support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many chose to unlock their pressures by communicating with the outside world through their work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Our work can yield incredible returns, especially in times such as the present one.</seg>
<seg id="38">But care for themselves is still the first place.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to communicate with the manager so that we can be kept abreast of your situation and adjust it accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Priority is given to safeguarding vital work.</seg>
<seg id="41">We must maintain the proper functioning of some important work.</seg>
<seg id="42">The work of the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operations team, the trust and security team and the fund-raising team (and other teams) is essential and may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will begin to assess the current goals with all sectors and shift our focus to support some of the matters that are essential to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">We all have much work to do, but we need to focus our work on the most important items.</seg>
<seg id="45">A temporary slowdown would not affect future developments.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not intend to "work overtime" after the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="47">We will not ask you to work overtime to meet your working hours, as it now seems impractical.</seg>
<seg id="48">We accept that the current environment has changed, and we will set new targets and timetables, as appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="49">What will APP (annual plan) change?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to adapt to new realities and daily working time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time for budget formulation to enable staff to prioritize key work and care for themselves and their families, while adjusting working arrangements for those who need or wish to reduce.</seg>
<seg id="52">The extension of the schedule would significantly reduce the current planned workload and reduce the pressure on work throughout the Organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">We will present these proposals to the Board next week. If they are adopted, we will update the working arrangements for follow-up to delegates and teams as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thank the APP team for its leadership in this process.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office condition, exposure and cleaning</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that a colleague from the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, for the sake of caution, we have hired anti-virus cleaners to fully sterilize the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They use hospital-level disinfection solutions to dissipate surfaces and halls and elevators leading to our floors.</seg>
<seg id="59">The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement and using the corresponding products to secure tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are confident that the Office is fully prepared to come to you when you decide to return to work.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our Washington, D.C. office is based on the WeWorkoffice, which shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington, D.C. staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office had been converted to a full-time remote location, in line with the guidance we shared with the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="63">At the same time, as some colleagues in the New York office have already been aware, we have also been discussing issues related to the leasing of office space in the Brooklyn area.</seg>
<seg id="64">These discussions continue, but may be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">For the first time, some colleagues were contacted to work remotely.</seg>
<seg id="66">Other long-term telemedicine colleagues would like to provide them with some suggestions for adapting their working methods:</seg>
<seg id="67">Meeting time should be kept within one to two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If more time is required, consideration should be given to decentralizing the content of the meetings to multiple dates.</seg>
<seg id="69">Clearly define the objectives of the meeting, set the agenda for the meeting and send reading materials in advance.</seg>
<seg id="70">Videoconferencing is used as a default meeting modality, with online collaboration and networking using tools such as Google Doc and Zoom.</seg>
<seg id="71">In each meeting, one moderator will chair, one person will be responsible for monitoring questions in the chat window and tracking changes in the list of speakers, and another will be responsible (or in multi-person collaboration) for the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need a comfortable headphone, please send an e-mail to contact the technical support unit.</seg>
<seg id="73">Your health allowance is used to buy zero food.</seg>
<seg id="74">Insert # remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues</seg>
<seg id="75">The Human Resources Operations Team is studying the manual engineering guidance in the form of webinars to help all Foundations colleagues to improve their efficiency during their distributed office hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public activities funded by Wikimedia, such as editors, before WHO announced the end of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="77">These requests for cancellation of activities and other restrictions may result in the failure of recipients of these communities to complete their intended contributions, and we have informed them that we understand this and have pledged that no one will be punished for postponing or modifying them.</seg>
<seg id="78">In the following week, we will continue to provide more guidance at community meetings and thematic community meetings in Wikimania and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="79">The global community now appears to be mourning the grief caused by the devastation of the epidemic, but it also reflects a sense of comfort in being able to maintain a clear focus on their respective communities, Wikimedia.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the future, the CRT team will set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for communities to monitor impact and track community-to-our communications.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maintain contact to communicate COVID-19-related issues</seg>
<seg id="82">We plan to convene a special staff meeting next Friday at 14: 00 (UTC) / 07: 00 (Pacific time), and we will send an invitation to you later in the calendar.</seg>
<seg id="83">At this meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and allow some time for an exchange of views.</seg>
<seg id="84">We stand united and do our best to help you.</seg>
<seg id="85">At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this e-mail and other important information relevant to COVID-19 at the Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and bring all information together in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are trying to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries / areas currently severely affected by the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have any doubts about travel, activities, main workflows or insurance, or if you need other help, please contact and cooperate with the CRT team at any time.</seg>
<seg id="89">We are ready to provide you with the support and liaison you need here.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have an intimate or sensitive issue, please send an e-mail to contact Bryan Judan, Chief of Global Human Resources Operations.</seg>
<seg id="91">Despite these changes, we cannot abandon our work and obligations as a result.</seg>
<seg id="92">On the contrary, the epidemic reminds us that we may now need to adjust our work and obligations in ways that have not been done in the past.</seg>
<seg id="93">We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to continue our work with each other, to provide the support needed for our actions and to continue to bring the services on which they depend to the world.</seg>
<seg id="94">There can be no challenge if we are ready to plan at all times.</seg>
<seg id="95">Now, I ask you to support each other in creating space for important work in the coming weeks and months.</seg>
<seg id="96">We need all to contribute to that goal, and we therefore ask everyone to take care of themselves and their families in order to remain in the best position when needed.</seg>
<seg id="97">Finally, I ask you to bear in mind that you wash hands and do not face the face.</seg>

<seg id="1">Need to update COVID-19 Diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases"</seg>
<seg id="2">By 6 February 2020, our team issued the Quick Recommendations Guide for the Diagnostic and Treatment of New Toponies (2019-nCoV) Infections, which provides lessons and lessons for a global response.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease, and our knowledge of the disease is increasing on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are being updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we respond to a comment on the above-mentioned guidelines and provide updated "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" and based on the latest COVID-19 diagnostic programme issued by the National Health Health Council of the People.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, 2019 new coronary virus (2019-nCoV) broke out, and the disease is now officially named 2019 Coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which was named.</seg>
<seg id="6">On 11 March 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">In response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid recommendation guide, which was published online in Military Medical Research magazine on 2 February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since its publication, it has attracted widespread attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be noted, however, that COVID-19 is a new type of disease and that our knowledge of the disease is increasing on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the National Health Health Council of the People's Republic of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /) has published a total of 7 editions of COVID-19 from 16 January 2020 to 3</seg>
<seg id="11">Our guide now receives the views of Zhou et al., who propose a simple rating programme based on their clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their work provides new evidence for our guidance and valuable references to this global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="13">We acknowledge and thank them for their important work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, their proposals also need to be updated on the basis of the latest COVID-19 diagnostic programme (pilot version 7) and recent research.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases requires a combination of an epidemiological history characteristic with two clinical performances for a comprehensive analysis and, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) Previous exposure prior to symptoms 14 days Previous exposure (COVID-19) Previous exposure in Vukhan or in other communities with reported cases (2); SARS</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical performance: (1) heat and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) photographic properties with COVID-19 infections; and (3) normal or reduced number of early childhood white cells, and lymphometer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Diagnoses of diagnosed cases should be based on a suspected case, with any of the following hypothesis or seropositive: (1) SARS-CoV-2 positive CRR (2);</seg>
<seg id="19">As can be seen, the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions add real-time PCR tests in respiratory or blood markers.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fourth (1-27 January 2020) and fifth (2-8 February 2020) editions have increased the prophylactic testing of blood signs; the seventh edition has since added blood seropositive evidence.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to study the best nucleate test boxes for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory labels, including blood mining, which increase the availability of different samples and provide evidence of positive results.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, there is growing evidence that reminds us of the symptoms of atypical symptoms and symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify persons without clinical symptoms as "low risk."</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the rating system needs to be validated in further clinical practices and studies.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, we would like more direct evidence to emerge and call on the reader to comment.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we propose to refer to and follow the latest guidelines of the country in which the case is committed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team will also help by updating our guidance in a timely manner.</seg>

<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths that day.</seg>
<seg id="3">This has created a new rate of single-day deaths due to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="4">As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Control (IEDC) recorded 114 confirmed cases and 33 cases were cured after rest in the home.</seg>

<seg id="1">The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a major exodus</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 (diseases caused by coronary virus SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">While the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease and not to the risk of a particular case, WHO notes the need to urge the Government to take measures:</seg>
<seg id="4">"All countries / regions can still change the process of this pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said, if each country / region responded by testing, testing, treating, isolating, tracking and mobilizing its people.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and severity, as well as the levels of inaction."</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="8">In February, he commented at CNN that "except for influenza, no respiratory virus has been detected and continues to spread globally."</seg>
<seg id="9">Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said that "we have never seen a general epidemic caused by the coronary virus before."</seg>
<seg id="10">He continues to say, "Similarly, we have never seen a controlled pandemic of the virus."</seg>
<seg id="11">Prior to the onset of the pandemic, in January, WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute for Sensitive and Infectious Diseases of the United States, "most importantly, it is still deteriorating."</seg>
<seg id="13">By Thursday, the Federation had reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 globally, resulting in over 46,000 deaths.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 Laboratory testing methods for respiratory coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include detection of the presence of the virus and the generation of antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2">RT-PCR can detect the coronary virus RNA and thus determine the presence of the virus in the sample.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is the characteristic test of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.</seg>
<seg id="4">They can be used to determine whether they have recently been infected or whether they have been sexually active.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody testing (serum testing) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody testing shows how many people are infected with the virus, including those with mild symptoms without reporting or symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="7">The results of this test determine the precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunization of the population groups.</seg>
<seg id="8">Owing to the limited number of tests, no country / region was in a position to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population by March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">As at 23 March, no country / region had more than 3 per cent of its population and the number of tests completed varied significantly from country to region.</seg>
<seg id="10">This difference may also seriously affect the reported case mortality rate, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Real-time RRT-PCR (RRT-PCR) tests using swallowed throat watches are only completed within the first week of the virus before reliable results can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RT-PCR test, carried out using swallowed seismers, is only completed within the first week after the virus has been infected, and reliable results can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since then, the virus has disappeared in the throat but continues to flourish in the lung.</seg>
<seg id="15">For infected persons tested in the second week of infection, samples may be substituted for deep respiratory extracts obtained by injection tubes, or cough extracts may be used (blood).</seg>
<seg id="16">In January 2020, RRT-PCR was issued at CharitÃ© Hospital in Berlin, one of the early PCR tests and served as the basis for 250 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">A detection method was also developed in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2020. On 28 January 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical level based on PCR's SARS-CoV-2 test.</seg>
<seg id="18">It looked for "E" cartoons for all beta coronies, and SARS-CoV-2 for RdRp. In China, the China Large Vehicle (BGRS I Group).</seg>
<seg id="19">The early version of the test agent box uses three gene testing methods, one of which is the inability to determine results due to reagent defects and the detection bottleneck in Atlanta CDC; this results in an average of 100.</seg>
<seg id="20">The two-part test method was found to be reliable only on 28 February 2020, when the state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The test was authorized by the United States Food and Pharmaceutical Supervisory Authority on the basis of an emergency use authorization. The United States commercial laboratory started testing in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR could be conducted nationwide from 5 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics similarly announced that a nationwide COVID-19 test would be available as of 9 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantitative limits are announced; sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with the DC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, COVID-19 was developed and produced by the National Centre for Research on Epidemiology and Biotechnology (Vector).</seg>
<seg id="26">On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Health Supervisory Authority of the Russian Federation. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Meo clinic had developed a test box to detect COVID-19 infection, Diche 3</seg>
<seg id="27">On 19 March 2020, FDA issued to Abbott Laboratory an emergency use authorization for testing using the Abbott m2000 system (EUScientific A); FDA was previously issued to Thologic.</seg>
<seg id="28">An approximately 45-minute test method for Cepheid was also authorized for the emergency use of FDA on 21 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="29">FDA has approved a detection method to replace PCR with temperature augmentation technologies such as nuclear acid.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the method does not require a series of temperature cycles, positive results can be obtained only 5 minutes and negative results can be determined within 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">The United States currently has approximately 18,000 such devices, and Abbott is expected to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a single-cloud resistant test (specifically like a new coronary virus) nuclear protein</seg>
<seg id="32">A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "the diagnostic value of chest tails at the early stages of the virus is small, while the performance of CT [computer crane scanning] may be evident even before the symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical features of CT include double lung grinding glass, exterior asymmetry and backscattering.</seg>
<seg id="34">As the disease progresses, it will be developed to become visible in the chest, rock feet and lung mutations.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study of PC R and CT in Vukhan (where the current pandemic began) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but that CT is less precise and that many of its visual characteristics overlap with other pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="36">As of March 2020, the American Radiation Society recommended that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a one-line test tool for diagnosing COVID-19." Initial screening 3 March 2020 CDC recommended use</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to infection is resistance, including IGM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antigens can be used to detect individual infections around 7 days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immunization status of the monitored population. They can be measured at the central laboratory (CLT) or through instant testing (PoCT).</seg>
<seg id="39">These measurements can be performed in many clinical laboratories with high-throughput automated systems, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by serial samples, it is usually measured using an exterior blood sample.</seg>
<seg id="41">For PoCT, a blood sample is generally obtained using skin piercing.</seg>
<seg id="42">This is different from the PCR method prior to determination. On 26 March 2020, FDA approved testing methods for 29 entities that are now able to distribute their anti-medical test kits.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of 7 April 2020, FDA had approved only one test under the emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Epitope Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics test kits were approved for tests.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hundreds of samples can be detected within a few hours of detection capacity, so that the rate of detection of the virus RNA is much faster than that of the traditional PCR.</seg>
<seg id="45">Generally, resistance can be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom found that none of the anti-medical test kits it purchased were of sufficient good use.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hong Kong has put in place a mechanism to prevent suspected patients from living in their homes. "Emergency rooms provide them with sample tubes," patients must pass through the tube and send the tube back to the home at a later stage.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Vehicle Exemption Testing Centre has helped Korea to conduct faster and widest testing than other countries. In Germany, on 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Doctors indicated that non-hospitalized institutions were able. The previous week</seg>
<seg id="48">In the case of testing at the request of a doctor, the cost is borne by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Director of the Robert Koch Institute of Germany indicated that Germany had a total detection capacity of 160,000 per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of 19 March, car-free testing had been provided in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only the number of positive tests was reported.</seg>
<seg id="52">A preliminary 10,000 laboratory survey showed that by 2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples (including 12 weeks of 2020) had been tested "at least 12 weeks" and only 33,491 samples were tested (6.9%).</seg>
<seg id="53">The laboratory, which was constructed 5 days under the supervision of the Greater Gome Founder, showed a 47 per cent increase in the cases in Hubei and a doubling of the corresponding costs of treatment segregation, if not.</seg>
<seg id="54">Following the Wuhan Laboratory, the Fire Laboratory was established immediately after Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, and currently has 12 cities in China.</seg>
<seg id="55">By 4 March 2020, laboratory test daily flux totals 50,000 per day. Origami Assays release source, multicircuit design, which is self-tested through 93 tests, can be performed with multiple dars 1122 patient samples</seg>
<seg id="56">By March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had been an obstacle to large-scale testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="57">This led a number of sponsors to explore sample preparation programmes involving the heating of samples to 98 Â° C (208 Â° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced more testing on 31 March</seg>
<seg id="58">This capacity has been achieved through the use of decommissioning (Drive-pass) tests, on the one hand, and the funding provided to groups 42 and China (based on their Fire Emergency Testing Laboratory).</seg>
<seg id="59">The laboratory, which was constructed within 14 days and is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PC tests per day, is the first laboratory of this size in the world to operate outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">Different testing methods have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States for various components of the coronary virus genetic spectrum.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test kits by sending test boxes to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own test kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German approach was published on 17 January 2020; the programme developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not be used later than 28 months, limiting United States detection capabilities. China and the United States encountered inadequate testing,</seg>
<seg id="63">In contrast, extensive testing in the Republic of Korea was seen by experts as useful in reducing the spread of new coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thanks to the detection capacity established by the Korean Government over the past few years, its main focus has been on laboratories in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="65">On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for additional testing programmes as the best way to mitigate COVID-19 epidemiological development. Widespread transmission of the virus led to high demand for testing, resulting in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test box.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the United States, test kits developed by CDC contained "defects"; subsequently, the Government removed bureaucratic barriers to private laboratory testing. Spain did not purchase test boxes from the Chinese company Shenzhen Biotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="68">It explained that the inaccuracy of the results of the tests could be the result of the incorrect collection of samples or the incorrect use of test agent boxes.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish Cabinet indicated that the test box to recover the erroneous results would be replaced with another test box provided by Shenzhen Bioton. The Czech Republic did not find it correct to purchase 80 per cent of test boxes.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister MatoviÄ suggested that the test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. The Turkish Ministry of Health Atek Kara stated that the test cartridges purchased by Turkey from China were "incorrectly tested."</seg>
<seg id="71">Testing and segregation of those who tested positive and tracking the exposure history of SARS-CoV-2 positive results.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vos (Italy's first COVID-19 place of death) conducted two rounds of testing for a total of approximately 3,400 people, each lasting about 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of them had tested positive and had no symptoms, and all the cases found had been isolated.</seg>
<seg id="74">By imposing travel restrictions on communities, new infections have been completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restricted travel, testing and isolation, 2020 coronary virus transmission in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries / regions, and Singapore has not introduced extreme restrictions, such as mandatory closure of restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="76">In Singapore, many activities were cancelled and residents were advised to stay at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened on time after the holiday period of 23 March.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries / areas, such as Ireland and the Republic of Korea, have also contained large-scale outbreaks of disease through large-scale tracking of contacts, restricted travel, detection and isolation, and less radical closure measures.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that the higher the number of cases tested compared to the number of deaths, the lower the case mortality rate, possibly due to the better ability of those countries to detect only mild symptoms or symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">Who Recommended that countries with no detection capacity and limited national laboratory processing COVID-19 experience send one of their top five positive and top 10 negative COVID-19 samples for validation in one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories</seg>
<seg id="80">Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the graph below, "Testing positive%" is influenced by the national testing policy of the country in question.</seg>
<seg id="82">In other cases with the same conditions, the positive detection rate is higher in countries where only hospitalized persons are detected, as compared to those where all citizens (whether or not symptoms are detected).</seg>

<seg id="1">There was a rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020</seg>
<seg id="2">In EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) shows similar trends, confirming that while different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the Italian experience, the State, hospitals and psychiatric wards need to be better prepared to cope with the surge of COVID-19, which is particularly important.</seg>
<seg id="4">On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were reported in the city of Vukhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 9 September 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported that pathogens were a new coronary virus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronus 2 (Severe Acute Coavius).</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, diseases caused by infections in SARS-CoV-2 have been named coronary virus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence to date indicates that about 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases are minor, that is, respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of the approximately 14 per cent of cases, COVID-19 will progress in terms of severe illness and need for hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent will progress in critical condition and need to be re-cared for.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mortality rate of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is about 4 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this study, we assessed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the European Union / European Economic Area (European Union, EU / European Economic Area, EEA), as well as in the United Kingdom (UK).</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compare the number of current COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">EU / EEA National and British COVID-19 Cases</seg>
<seg id="13">Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic are now similar to those of China in other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the European Surveillance magazine published on 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first COVID-19 cases in Europe based on the WHO definition of cases.</seg>
<seg id="16">In EU / EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on 24 January 2020, involving naturalized persons in the city of Vukhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="17">As at 15 March 2020, all 30 EU / EEA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, had detected COVID-19 cases, of which between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2012, 7 were reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">Access to COVID-19 cumulative quantity and incidence</seg>
<seg id="19">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the reported COVID-19 cases from each country worldwide at 8 a.m. each day and is obtained only through official sources such as national health ministries, national and regional health authorities.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data have been used to assess trends in EU / EEA and UK COVID-19 and to compare them with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">We calculated a 14-day cumulative incidence rate for each EU / EEA country and the UK COVID-19 case between 1 January and 15 March 2020 to be considered as activity COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="22">We also provided the total number of reported cumulative cases for each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8.00 a.m. and compared with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">EU / EEA Country and British COVID-19 Trends</seg>
<seg id="24">The trend in the EU / EEA country and the UK's COVID-19 case 14-day cumulative incidence is generally consistent with that of the Province of Hubei (China) (figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">For EU / EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased since around 21 February 2020 and then dramatically around 28 days (supplementary material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but similar increases are observed in all other EU / EEA countries as well as in the UK COVID-19 cumulative morbidity (supplementary information).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 and compares them with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="28">It should be emphasized that as of 15 March, at 8.00 a.m., 15 other EU / EEA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, have reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy in less than 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported by EU / EEA and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="30">Observed COVID-19 cumulative morbidity trends indicate that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">Although different countries are at different stages of their public health responses, countries may have different definitions of cases and options for selecting patients subject to COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including supplementary testing, vary, but the situation is the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, while media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care wards in those areas had reached maximum capacity.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the EU / EEA level, only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of COVID-19 cases are currently available for hospitalization and / or access to intensive care wards, respectively (data are not available).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of places in custody and medium-term care available in European countries varied considerably, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal for every 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive custody and medium-term care beds per 10,000 people in 2010-2011).</seg>
<seg id="37">ECDC's sixth update of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment modelled on health-care saturation and related landscape and assessed the relationship between each EU / EEA country and United Kingdom residential COVID-19 patients;</seg>
<seg id="38">Since cases have so far been concentrated in EU / EEA countries and in certain regions of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care wards usually serve the population covered by the identified areas, it would be preferable to provide information at the standard geographical unit. "NUTS-2</seg>
<seg id="39">The Italian experience and current trends in other countries indicate that the EU / EEA and the British COVID-19 pandemic are developing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="40">The State, hospitals and intensive care wards should therefore be prepared to respond to the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of people in need of health care, especially COVID-19, in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As noted in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, rapid, positive and comprehensive approaches are critical to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and require a transition from containment to mitigation, as early decision makers and hospital</seg>
<seg id="42">The rapid risk assessment also identified public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a short window of opportunity through which countries may further strengthen controls to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care systems.</seg>
<seg id="44">Otherwise, health-care systems in other EU / EEA countries are likely to face a surge in the number of people in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="5">SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in central China at the end of 2019, once again placed CoV at the centre of concern, surprising that it was very sexually transmitted compared to its sister virus SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="6">As HCoV infection is a common animal disease, it would be useful to know the origins of HCoV's co-disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most HCoV originates from bats and are non-pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">The owner of some HCoV intermediate storage is also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">Identification of animal hostels is directly relevant to the prevention of human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Research into the interaction of CoV hosts in animals may also provide a deeper understanding of human CoV morbidity mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this overview, we provide an overview of the knowledge available in seven HCoV categories, highlighting their discovery history, the origins of co-disease in humans and animals and the intergenerational transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Importantly, we have compared and compared different HCoV from the point of view of the evolution of the virus and the restructuring of the genome.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this context, we have explored the current epidemic of the 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the paper focuses on the requirements for successful host conversion and the impact of virus penetration on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">CoV is part of the coronary virus section and consists of a group of justice blanket chains RNA viruses.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses contain the largest genome in the RNA virus, with 2.6 to 3.2 million alkali, and are referred to as the "coronary virus" (CoV) for presentation of coronary form under an electronic mirror.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, CoV has a non-subset genome that shares similar organizations.</seg>
<seg id="18">About two thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b) that have been translated into pp1a and pp1ab for replication of enzyme polyprotein.</seg>
<seg id="19">These multi-polar proteins were further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1 ~ 16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome consists of ORF for structural proteins, including irritation (S), film (E), film (M) and nuclear protein (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">Many auxiliary proteins of spectrum heterogeneity are also coV coded by different spectral systems.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to differences in protein series, CoV is divided into four parts (al- CoV, beta-CoV, gamme-CoV and Delhi-CoV), of which beta-CoV comprises the majority.</seg>
<seg id="23">System development evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic sources of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main hostels of gamma-CoV and Delhi-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, 7 infections are known to be coronary virus (HCoV).</seg>
<seg id="26">Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alCoV.</seg>
<seg id="27">Other 5 species, beta-CoV, including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, Middle East RS-CoV (SARS-CoV).</seg>
<seg id="28">HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually give rise to minor symptoms such as common feelings and / or diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, leading to severe lower respiratory infections among a relatively larger number of patients and are more likely to acute</seg>
<seg id="30">20 Century In mid-1960s, the first HCoV-229E strains B814 were separated from the nose endocrine of common influenza patients.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, human beings have gained more knowledge through extensive research on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which can give rise to both self-critical symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, prior to the outbreak of SARS, the concept of infection HCoV, usually innocent, was widely accepted.</seg>
<seg id="33">The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude death rate of about 10 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, following the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">2019 New HCoVviruses (2019-nCoV, later known as SARS-CoV-2) are the continuing 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) multiple days, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm has begun and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All 7 HCoV have a common source of disease in human animals from bats, rats or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is a variety of evidence that all HCoV penetration originates from bats, where the virus is well adaptable and non-pathogenic but exhibits great genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic poses enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="40">Tracking the origins of HCoV's co-infection in human animals provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and constraints of the leapfrogging of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, it will guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 depositors, middlemen and extended animal dormitories, which will be important in preventing future spillovers of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this overview, we provide an overview of the co-incidence, inter-plant transmission and morbidity mechanisms of HCoV's human animals.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we have highlighted and explored a common theme that HCoV's intimate viruses are not usually pathogenic in its natural receptacle, but are pathogenic when transmitted across species to the new host.</seg>
<seg id="44">In addition, we recall the trend towards the evolution of HCoV, where increased portability is often accompanied by reduced morbidity.</seg>
<seg id="45">In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animals CoV has been widely known since the end of the twentieth century.</seg>
<seg id="47">Prior to the first separation of HCoV-229E strains B814 from the nasal endocrine of common influenza patients, the physicians were already in various affected fauna (including chickens, rats.</seg>
<seg id="48">Over the past few decades, 7 HCoV have been detected.</seg>
<seg id="49">A brief chronological summary of the history of HCoV discoveries (table 1) would provide us with rich information and guidance.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 1966, the first HCoV-229E virus strains were separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections and subsequently grown in Wi-38 lung-cell strains.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with HCoV-229E suffer from common feeling symptoms such as headaches, spraying, discomfort, throat, and 10 - 20% from hot, cough and other symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from organs development in the mice brain and subsequent successive generations.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to HCoV-229E infections, with no significant differences in symptoms compared to other respiratory pathogens such as the influenza virus and nose.</seg>
<seg id="54">HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in the winter of the temperate climate.</seg>
<seg id="55">As a rule, the two viruses have less than one week of latency, followed by approximately 2 weeks of illness.</seg>
<seg id="56">A study of human volunteers shows that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E may experience moderate general influenza.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few patients with low immune capacity exhibit severe lower respiratory infections.</seg>
<seg id="58">SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," is the first well-documented epidemic in human history caused by HCoV, whose pathogens are SARS-CoV, the third found HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first case, SARS, dates back to the late 2002 province of Guangdong, China.</seg>
<seg id="60">The outbreak in SARS resulted in 8,096 reported cases, 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">With the exception of super-transmitters, it is estimated that each case may result in some 2 subsequent cases, with a probation period of 4 to 7 days and a 10-day high in the load of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="62">Infections SARS-CoV patients began with muscle pain, headaches, heat, discomfort and cold war, followed by later symptoms such as respiratory distress, cough and respiratory distress.</seg>
<seg id="63">The reduction of lymphocytes, liver screening anomalies and the rise in muscle acid laser enzyme are common laboratory checks in SARS.</seg>
<seg id="64">In addition, corrosive pneumatic foam damage, leather cell propagation and increased infiltration cells were observed among SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some 20-30 per cent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal, liver and kidney, are also likely to be infected and are usually associated with cell storms, which may be fatal among patients with low immunology.</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first separated from an open lung test of a relative from a source patient who travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, there has been a commitment to the HCoV study.</seg>
<seg id="69">HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="70">The virus was initially found to be prevalent among young children, the elderly and those suffering from respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, nasal, meningitis, fever and bronchitis are common.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study showed that the same virus had been separated from the nasal slogans of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, in practice it is distributed globally.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with a peak in early summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive pneumonia (also known as Grophoritis).</seg>
<seg id="76">In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and bronchitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to community access to sexual pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with acute asthma.</seg>
<seg id="78">Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four communities have been well adapted to humans and are often less likely to cause highly pathogenic diseases as a result of mutagenic changes. There are also accidental and unknown causes such as HV CoV-N</seg>
<seg id="80">Typically, these HCoV are less toxic or pathogenic when they acquire the capacity for effective transmission and continued survival in the human body.</seg>
<seg id="81">MERS-CoV was first separated from the pneumonia of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although most laboratory confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases are reported in European countries and Tunisia, where there are occasional cases of STIs to close contact.</seg>
<seg id="83">In 2015, there was a resurgence of sexually transmitted infections in Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="84">The clinical performance of MERS is similar to that of SARS and is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have experienced acute kidney failure, a characteristic characteristic of the disease that has so far been caused by HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30 per cent of patients suffer from gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhoea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases and a high death rate of 34.4 per cent were reported from laboratories, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">In late December 2019, concentrated pneumonia was found in the city of Vukhan, Hubei Province, China, and it was confirmed by retrospective analysis that it was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization declared the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">By 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude death rate of 3.4 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="91">It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2 per cent, compared with 1.2 per cent in areas other than Lake North.</seg>
<seg id="92">Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe respiratory infections in the form of fever, cough and respiratory difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some patients also suffer from diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms that can rapidly develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the homogeneity of 82 per cent of the denotide serial series, they are clustered into different branches in system development trees.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are significantly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV-2 but more infectious.</seg>
<seg id="97">The reported emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to accelerate the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="98">By comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other 6 HCoV, we can discover very interesting similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the probability and duration of the HCoV disease are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trends of other 6 HCoV categories.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms ranges from SARS-CoV to 4 communities HCoV (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HV-1</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in community access to HCoV infections, including non-heterogeneous, light or even symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, a small number of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infections, albeit at a slightly lower rate.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of community access HCoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as community accessibility HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it remains to be tested whether SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will decline after human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, as with other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in excreta samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">At least in some cases, the mass-oral dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, which plays an important role as in SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified in future studies.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community access HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, transmission, morbidity and continuous transmission after generations will have important implications for the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="111">All 4 communities with mild symptoms HCoV have been well adapted to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="112">From another perspective, humankind has also well adapted to these 4 HCoV species.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both may be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="114">HCoV, who causes serious human diseases, and those suffering from HCoV diseases have all died.</seg>
<seg id="115">To this end, HCoV must undergo adequate replication in humans in order to accumulate adaptive surges in order to counter host constraints.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the epidemic continues, the greater the number of people infected, the greater the likelihood that it will be fully adapted to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it is well adapted, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">Over the years, four of these communities have acquired sexual coronary viruses that have spread among the population, leading to common influenza among people with normal immune functions.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require animal hostels.</seg>
<seg id="120">In contrast, high pathogenicity SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to human beings and cannot be transmitted continuously in humans.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to sustain and reproduce among paediatric dormitories and may find opportunities to spread to vulnerable populations through one or more middlemen and extended hostels.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to those of SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and 4 community access HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is as highly infectious as community access HCoV, at least at present.</seg>
<seg id="124">However, it is more pathogenic than community access to sexual HCoV, and lower than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to humanity and circulates within humans in the absence of dormitories or intermediate animal hosts.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the origin of HCoV's animal, the definition and characteristics of the intake, natural, storekeeper, middleman and expanded hostel of HCoV are of some guidance to us.</seg>
<seg id="127">If an animal has a closely related ancestral heterogeneity at the denotide sequence level, the animal will become the intricate hostel of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="128">The ancestral virus is usually highly adaptable and non-pathogenic in the host.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, storage owners will carry HCoV on a permanent and continuous basis.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its viruses.</seg>
<seg id="131">By contrast, if HCoV has just been placed in the middleman or immediately in the body, it will not be well adapted to the new hostel and will usually be pathological.</seg>
<seg id="132">Such dormitories can serve as a source of co-infection among human beings and serve as hostels by allowing the virus to be replicated briefly and then transmitted to humans to scale up human infections.</seg>
<seg id="133">If HCoV is unable to maintain its transmission within the middleman, end-of-life infections may occur.</seg>
<seg id="134">On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt to middlemen or even create long-term localities.</seg>
<seg id="135">In such cases, the middleman becomes the natural receptacle.</seg>
<seg id="136">Epidemiological data retrospective analysis found that SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals in indexing cases.</seg>
<seg id="137">Subsequent seropositive surveys show higher levels of immune proteg (IgG) in animal vendors against SARS-CoV compared to the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the living animal market, orchards and a cal were found for the first time to be almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus SARS-CoV sample virus.</seg>
<seg id="139">This view is indirectly supported by the fact that there is no further SARS report after removing all the fruits from the market.</seg>
<seg id="140">However, it was reported that the testing of SARS-CoV was largely negative in the wild or unexposed farm fruit market, which suggests that it may be only the middleman hostel and not SARS Co.</seg>
<seg id="141">Notably, since 80 per cent of the different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV resistance, it cannot be excluded that a wide range of small mammals may also serve as hosts in SARS.</seg>
<seg id="142">All of these animals appear to be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="143">A subsequent study of the SARS-CoV natural animal hostel found a closely related bats coronary virus known as SARS-related pyredron virus HKU3 (SARSr-RBatV).</seg>
<seg id="144">These bats are positive to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.</seg>
<seg id="145">The virus and other bats coronary viruses are homogenous to SARS-CoV with 88-92 per cent serial serial denotide.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept of bats as hostels of emerging human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">In addition, researchers have identified multiple SARS coronary viruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but with the exception of one designated WIV1, none of the viruses can be separated as live viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">Human cardiovascular stress conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2) are known to be SARS-CoV recipients.</seg>
<seg id="149">WIV1, extracted from bats faecal samples, has been shown to use bats, fruits and human ACE2 as its admissions to the cell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Interestingly, SARS is able to moderate the serum and WIV1 among patients in the recovery period.</seg>
<seg id="151">To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestors to bats SARS-CoV, with 95 per cent of the serial homogeneity of nucleotide.</seg>
<seg id="152">Although the two viruses are highly homogeneous, WIV1 is generally not considered to be a direct kinship virus of SARS-CoV, nor is the bats the direct collector of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">The systematic development analysis classifies MERS-CoV as the same group as Bats CoV-HKU4 and Bats CoV-HKU5.</seg>
<seg id="154">Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV invaded the virus with the same host of diphetaminated herpid enzyme 4 (DPP4).</seg>
<seg id="155">RNA dependency RNA polyenzyme sequences in MERS-CoV are more close to RNA in system development than in bats and beta-CoV from Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">To date, MERS-CoV has not been found alive in wild bats.</seg>
<seg id="157">MERS-CoV and its close bats CoV-HKU25 have only 87 per cent serial homogeneity of nucleion.</seg>
<seg id="158">Therefore, bats may not be direct depositories of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single jockeys are seropositive to MERS-CoV heterogeneity and antibody blood, similar to camels originating in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="160">The work separated from the nose of a single camel MERS-CoV is the same as the virus found in the body, which further demonstrates that camels are the true hostel of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It should also be noted that in the camels of the experimental infection MERS-CoV, the general symptoms were minor, but a large number of viruses were observed to have dropped.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is worth noting that infected camels transmit the virus not only through respiratory channels but also through septic channels, which are also the main means of spreading the virus to bats.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, problems remain, as many of the confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camel prior to symptoms, which may be attributed to artificial or unknown channels of transmission, including unidentified species MERS Co.</seg>
<seg id="164">SARS-CoV-2 Bats CoV RaTG13, separated from the pyrethyroids, have 96.2 per cent nucleate acid homogeneity.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to determine kinship relationships.</seg>
<seg id="166">In other words, the bats may not be the direct receptacle of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bats are found in the future.</seg>
<seg id="167">It is assumed that many of the first COVID-19 cases of wild species sold and slaughtered by SARS-CoV-2 dormitories at the wholesale market in the South China Sea are relevant.</seg>
<seg id="168">Recent studies based on macro-genome sequencing have shown that a endangered small mammals known as wearing mountains (Malay worms) may also carry ancestral beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="169">These new isotopic viruses genomes are homogenous to SARS-CoV-2 with 85-92 per cent serial serial densification.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with about 90 per cent homogeneity at the serial level of nucleotide.</seg>
<seg id="171">In system development trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 sample virus subsystems, one of which is more similar to SARS-CoV-2 with a base serum of 97.4 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="172">In contrast, the RBD differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are greater, although they are more homogenous to the entire genome.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study on pneumonia also reported an overlap of viruses detected from lung samples, with results similar to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">Using different assembly methods and manual processing, the study obtained some of the genome sequence of approximately 86.3 per cent of the entire genome of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="175">We cannot rule out the possibility that mountains are one of the stomach hosts of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from mountains due to differences in the sequence of beta-CoV associated with the wearing of mountains SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 associated with impressions.</seg>
<seg id="178">SARS-CoV-2 pathway in bats, mountains and other mammals remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="179">Although the highest sequential homogeneity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and mountain alloys, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is highly assumed that the high similarity between penetrating SARS-CoV-2 related to beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD is fuelled by selective convergences.</seg>
<seg id="181">Another contrary view is that beta-CoV and RaTG13, associated with mountainous SARS-CoV-2, have been reorganized in the third wildlife species.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a driving force for evolution, reorganization is widespread in beta-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="183">The source of direct human and animal co-disease at SARS-CoV-2 is not yet determined.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to high pathogenic HCoV, researchers studied HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1</seg>
<seg id="185">Systematic developmental evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bats coronary virus, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1</seg>
<seg id="186">It is reported that the bats' coronary virus found in three North American bats, known as Appalachian Ridge CoV, shows that it is closely related to HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E has genetic links with another bats coronary virus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008), of which camel animals are suspected.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity purposes, figures 1 and 2 summarize existing knowledge of known animal origins of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="189">Systematic development analysis provides evidence of historical episodes of intermittent transmission in HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="190">After 1890, when HCoV-OC43 transgendered from livestock to humans, there was a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of inter-ethnic transmission of HCoV-229E is not yet known.</seg>
<seg id="192">Bats alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HCoV-229E, has been found.</seg>
<seg id="193">Between the two, a grain alpha-CoV emerged.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is multiple evidence to support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, humans, rather than goats, may be exposed to bats in a common ecological position.</seg>
<seg id="196">On the contrary, humans have close contact with sheep camels.</seg>
<seg id="197">Secondly, bats alpha-CoV associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV causes respiratory outbreaks in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, alpha-CoV was not found in wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="199">Therefore, the possibility of obtaining HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from human sources cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nepa virus and the Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">It is therefore not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">Alternatively, although bats alCoV serves as a gene bank for HCoV-229E, sheep camels and pockeys may be intermediate hosts of transmission of the virus to humans, exactly the same.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV is a good illustration of the spread from bats to single jockeys and from single pockeys to human species.</seg>
<seg id="204">The source of the penetration of the Bats MERS-CoV was known in its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries reinforced this argument.</seg>
<seg id="205">It is clear that bats provide a rich reservoir of viruses for interplant exchange and inter-plant transmission of gene tablets.</seg>
<seg id="206">Long-lived and intensive groups, strong social interaction and strong flight capabilities are all favourable conditions for bats to become ideal "virus transmitters."</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in a single cap for decades.</seg>
<seg id="208">It is well adapted to these camels, which have also been transformed from intermediate hostels to stable natural receptacles.</seg>
<seg id="209">MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains a relatively low volatility rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">It is an accident to the sporadic spread of human beings, who are still the end-occupants of MERS-CoV because it cannot be sustained.</seg>
<seg id="211">In contrast to the role of camels in the dissemination of MERS-CoV, the role of mountains in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, if any, is different.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, the wearing of mountain a beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in mountains.</seg>
<seg id="213">They may be SARS-CoV-2 associated end-occupants of beta-CoV similar to those in SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">Several possibilities for transmission from animals to human species must be identified or excluded in future studies.</seg>
<seg id="215">In the first place, bats may be the custodian of SARS-CoV-2 viruses almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans may share ecological positions with bats through slaughter or coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, mountainous worming may be one of the middlemen of the new invasions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="218">Human beings are infected with the virus through slaughter and the consumption of wild tastes.</seg>
<seg id="219">Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">There is a need for antibiotic surveys of livestock and wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="221">Thirdly, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be reorganized and adapted in the third species that have been exposed to bats and mountains.</seg>
<seg id="222">Research continues on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to the different types of animal hostels, the three main elements of the virus also play an important role in promoting coronary viruses across interplant barriers.</seg>
<seg id="224">First, they have a high volatility rate in RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">In comparison to other single chains RNA viruses, the probability of coronary virus mutation is estimated to be "medium" to "high," with an average replacement rate of about 10 per year for new dormitories</seg>
<seg id="226">The decontamination of coronary viruses with prophylactic nucleate spraying can lead to very high variability and decline, or even survival.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, the known nucleotide analogy, Remaivir, can inhibit coronary virus replication by suppressing this nucleate spillover enzyme and RNA dependence RNA.</seg>
<seg id="228">Redsey is one of the most promising resistant drugs to be tested in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the coronary virus is about 100,000 times more volatile than its host.</seg>
<seg id="230">Moreover, if the coronary virus is not well adapted to the host, it is usually very high.</seg>
<seg id="231">SARS-CoV is significantly lower than SARS-CoV-2, which has a high volatility rate, indicating that it is more adaptable to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">It can be assumed that it has adapted to another host close to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="233">Apart from SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a single cap.</seg>
<seg id="234">In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to result in the rapid neutralization of vaccines and antiretrovirals targeted at SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the larger coronary virus RNA genome has additional plastic properties in genetic mutations and reconfigurations, thus increasing the potential for inter-plant synergy, which facilitates the emergence of new coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="236">This is evidenced by the large number of unique open-reading boxes and protein functions that are coded towards the genome 3 'end-of-end code.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, in RNA replication, coronary viruses switch templates randomly and frequently through unique "replication options" mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="238">In hostels that are commingled packagings, chain exchanges are frequent during the transcription process.</seg>
<seg id="239">The entire population of highly homogeneous sources and the subgenome RNA can be reorganized to produce new coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="240">Evidence of the development of natural regroupment systems has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in bats SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.</seg>
<seg id="241">Transmission-related virus-host interactions</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, the interaction between the virus and host receptors is another key factor affecting transmission between species.</seg>
<seg id="243">A case in point is the reorganization of SARS-CoV, which shows evidence of a positive choice in the case of episodes of transmission.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on a comparative analysis of the separated strains of man and fruit tape SARS-CoV, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can adapt quickly to different hostels, particularly through the mutation of S proteRBD.</seg>
<seg id="245">Typically, RBD in coronary virus S protein interacts with cell receptors and is closely screened for host resistance.</seg>
<seg id="246">In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318 to 510 ammonia acid in the S1 section, which is integrated with the human ACE2 and its co-receptors to enable the virus to enter.</seg>
<seg id="247">RBD in SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 recipients of various animals, including bats, fruits, rats and mal, so that the virus can spread across species.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, in RBD, only six different ammonium acid residues were observed, including four in the sequence of interacting receptors with the ACE2 receptor, separate from the human and fruit virus.</seg>
<seg id="249">The presence of K479N and S487T mutations in RBD of SARS-CoV may increase the likelihood of fibre protein interacting with human ACE2 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, the replacement of these two ammonia acids may be essential for the adaptation of the virus to human beings.</seg>
<seg id="251">Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell bodies as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S protein S1 means that the association and strength of S protein with human ACE2 may change.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a cold telescope study shows that the relative strength of this combination is 10 to 20 times higher than that of the man ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also be useful to determine whether any other co-receptors were needed in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="255">Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also combined with ACE2, but with different parts of S.</seg>
<seg id="256">In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E ammonide phetaminated enzymes N and HCoV-OC43 9-O-ethyl.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also explain why the coronary virus has successfully adapted to humanity after spreading across species from animal hostels.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cell receptors, the results of the spread of the HCoV species are also influenced by other host dependency and restrictive factors.</seg>
<seg id="259">Differences in these staple proteins between humans and bats, single camels and rodents HCoV natural hostels may constitute barriers to intergenerational transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">HCoV Successful intergenerational transmission can only be achieved by depriving the host of the dependency factor and breaking the host's constraints.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this regard, the molecular determinants of the important field of HIV-host interaction have yet to be identified and identified.</seg>
<seg id="262">The use of the latest CRISPR technique for an impartial whole genome screening of SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and restrictive factors is likely to yield results.</seg>
<seg id="263">The emergence of a new type of HCoV: Back to its origin</seg>
<seg id="264">The diversity of bats' coronary virus offers ample opportunity for the emergence of a new type of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, bats' coronary virus serves as a gene bank for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutations and genetic regroupment are drivers of HCoV evolution and are two important steps in this process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coded genes could radically change the shape of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 was considered important for human adaptation because it separated SARS-CoV-related bats but found that they could be coded differently by ORF8 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="269">At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 NRN missing features of SARS-CoV were found in separated strains of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="270">This absence divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation to facilitate host conversion.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV may have been reorganized with the al- and gamma-CoV spectrum, where a large number of smaller reorganization areas have been identified in RNA dependency RNA polymer enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="272">Relocations were also found in nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, studies have shown that the prevalence of MERS-CoV has experienced an inter-spectral reorganization, which took place in a single camel in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganization incidents were observed in other HCoV, where HCoV and other animal coronies were reorganized in their non-structural genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be noted that artificial choices may lead to accidental changes in the virus genome, probably due to reduced pressure on options such as host immune systems to which the virus is exposed.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of these roles is that, in the HCoV-229E prototype virus strains, the absence of dual nucleotide acid has led to the absence of a full-time ORF4.</seg>
<seg id="277">Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV shows the insertion of individual nucleaciers, causing a drastic change.</seg>
<seg id="278">Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by pressure from the storekeeper's choice.</seg>
<seg id="279">After bats were infected with the coronary virus, no symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected, indicating that coronary viruses and bats were adapted to each other.</seg>
<seg id="280">Bats appear to be well adapted to coronary viruses from an anomaly and physiological point of view.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, bats' inflammatory flaws have been effective in reducing pathological changes caused by coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, bats' natural injury cell activities are inhibited by the ongoing regulation of depressive NKG2 / CD94 and the low level of molecular expression of the main tissues, Class I.</seg>
<seg id="283">Moreover, high-level active oxygen (Ros) generated by high metabolism in bats can contain the replication of coronary viruses and can provide high pressure for exposure to new dormitories.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic coronary strains may also be transformed through reorganization, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to accommodate hostels.</seg>
<seg id="285">Thus, it is no coincidence that three new models have emerged in the past two decades.</seg>
<seg id="286">The coronary virus does not cause disease or mild symptoms in hostels such as bats and camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They are heavily replicable and do not engender a strong host immune response.</seg>
<seg id="288">That is why there are symptoms and cases of serious human infections.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly due to the excessive activation of the immune response and cell storms, the greater the immune response and the greater the lung damage.</seg>
<seg id="290">In contrast, among those with symptoms, the immune response has been removed from the coronary virus replication.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy to link the immune response may have a positive impact in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="292">The disturbance reaction in bats was particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="293">Therefore, the use of type I jamming elements at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection should be useful.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, the pneumatic activity of NLRP3 in bats is flawed.</seg>
<seg id="295">Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 depression NLRP3 hepatitis may be useful for COVID-19 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general themes on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were created.</seg>
<seg id="297">Although 95 per cent of the congeners with SARS-CoV have been found to be bats beta-CoV, there is a bat coronary virus with SARS-CoV-2 as high as 96.</seg>
<seg id="298">While fruits and other animals in the market have been found to have the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct middleman of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified.</seg>
<seg id="299">Mountainous beta-CoV, which is clearly associated with SARS-CoV-2, has been found to indicate that it may be one of the median hosts, or that it has contributed to the final version. SARS</seg>
<seg id="300">Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentional or unintentional.</seg>
<seg id="301">As a result of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the coronary virus has re-emerged as a focus of attention.</seg>
<seg id="302">Research on the coronary virus in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the origins of HCoV co-disease and the importance of animal dormitories in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">There is considerable evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humanity through middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="304">Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the exposure of humans to the fruit market on the market, closing the wet cargo market and killing the fruit market can effectively put an end to the prevalence of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="305">Similarly, in view of the discovery of multiple spectrum bands that wear mountains, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, mountainous alpha should be removed from the wet cargo market in order to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, further research remains to be done on whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through mountains and other mammals.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed for a long time in a single cap.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels are important means of transport and are the main source of meat, milk, leather and straight-line products for the local population.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">Therefore, it is not possible to follow the practice of the China Wildlife Market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by sacrificing all camels in order to control MERS.</seg>
<seg id="311">In order to stop the resurgence of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camel, in conjunction with other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="312">As we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genes may emerge, leading to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="313">A variety of human and animal-borne coronary viruses are circulating in wildlife environments.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, bats with potential for co-infection in human animals are highly diverse.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many opportunities for the evolution and restructuring of the coronary virus, which is common to these animals, thus making it easier for future new coronies to spread and / or fatal in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="316">In some parts of China, the culture of consumption of wildlife should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="317">With the critical tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better prevention and response plans.</seg>
<seg id="318">Indeed, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They remain in their natural hostels until spillover opportunities arise.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although bats have many characteristics conducive to transmission of the virus, human exposure to bats and other wildlife species can be significantly reduced if people are educated away from bats and other wildlife species.</seg>
<seg id="321">In order to better understand the ecological status of coronary viruses and their natural hostels, continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary and will prove useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="322">In sum, the most effective way to prevent the co-infection of viral animals is for humans to stay far from the ecology of the natural habitants of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="323">SARS-CoV-2 also suffers from several deficiencies in the origins of co-infection in human animals.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to mountains, it would be useful to examine under what circumstances the same ecological position could be shared between bats and mountains.</seg>
<seg id="325">Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human communication, how humans are exposed to bats remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="326">Thirdly, if a third mammalian acts as a genuine median, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and mountains.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection studies should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the case of bats, drones or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be found in the natural hostel in the future, or almost identical to it.</seg>
<seg id="329">Continuing research in this area will reveal SARS-CoV-2 pathways to penetration in animals, which are important for human COVID-19 prevention and control.</seg>
