<seg id="1">The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, help track close contacts, and identify individuals who may have been in contact with infected persons ("contacts").</seg>
<seg id="2">Some regions and jurisdictions have developed or proposed many applications with the support of the official government.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many frameworks for building close contact tracking applications have been established.</seg>
<seg id="4">Privacy issues have also attracted attention from many parties, especially some systems need to track the geographic location of application users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less invasive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the distance between the user and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the integration of this Bluetooth-enabled function directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the government and Alipay have jointly developed an application to support citizens to check whether they have been exposed to COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">The program is currently used in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.</seg>
<seg id="9">This application was developed by the local IT community, released as open source software, and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based application "StopKorona!" to track the exposure of potentially infected people and help medical institutions respond quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication Technology and the Ministry of Health of Northern Macedonia.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of April 14, 2020, the application is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On April 12, the government announced that the close contact tracking application has entered the advanced stage of development and will be put into use in the next few weeks. Ireland and France also plan to launch similar applications ("StopCovid").</seg>
<seg id="13">Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geo-fencing application for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients will not leave home.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, cited some practical problems with application systems, including false positives and false positives, and if only a small percentage of people use the application, it may lack effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="15">To prevent the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple has set restrictions on the types of organizations that can distribute coronavirus-related applications in the Apple App Store, which is limited to "official" or other reputable organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon have also implemented similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy activists say they are concerned about large-scale surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure built in response to the coronavirus epidemic should be dismantled after the threat of the epidemic is eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="19">These organizations announced eight conditions to be met by government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";</seg>
<seg id="21">The monitoring and surveillance expansion must be provided with a "sunset" clause;</seg>
<seg id="22">The data collected is limited to COVID-19 purposes;</seg>
<seg id="23">Data security and anonymous information must be protected, and there is evidence that it is actually protected;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Any data sharing with third parties should be defined according to law;</seg>
<seg id="26">Must provide safeguards to prevent data misuse and provide citizens with the right to respond to data misuse;</seg>
<seg id="27">All "relevant stakeholders" are required to "effectively participate," including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued checklists.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google/Appleâs proposed plan aims to solve the problem of continuous monitoring and remove it from the deviceâs operating system once tracking is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some countries have adopted location tracking based on the network rather than the application, users do not need to download the application, and also avoid being tracked.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network solutions that can access the original location data may have serious privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with a central server require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only use the central server to communicate with each other have now been created (see below for details).</seg>
<seg id="33">South Korea has launched a system that is not based on applications to perform contact tracking tasks.</seg>
<seg id="34">The system does not use a special application, but chooses to collect tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combines this information to send notifications to potential infected people via SMS.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the government was also allowed to disclose location information because the country has made significant adjustments to the information privacy law after the MERS outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="36">The public can obtain this information through many applications and websites. Other countries (including Germany) are considering using both centralized systems and privacy protection systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of April 6, 2020, no specific details have been announced.</seg>
<seg id="38">Privacy protection Close contact tracking is a well-recognized concept, and a large number of relevant research literature dates back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy protection solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">PEPP-PT is a coordination scheme that includes centralized and decentralized methods, not a single protocol. The decentralized agreement includes decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, formerly called contact event number, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocol, and mobile contact tracking mechanism (PACT).</seg>
<seg id="40">According to these protocols, personally identifiable data will never leave the device, and all matching is done on the device.</seg>
<seg id="41">The privacy team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyâs Media Lab has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">The platform is based on the research content of the white paper "Rogue Application: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. In addition to this, Enigma MPC, a company originally founded in the MIT Media Lab and dedicated to the development of privacy technologies, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.</seg>
<seg id="44">On April 5, 2020, some groups formed a global TCN alliance around basically the same method and basically overlapping agreements. The goal is to reduce fragmented information and support global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications. This is achieved A key to wide application.</seg>
<seg id="45">On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that its official government application uses the open source BlueTrace protocol.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced a close contact tracking program, claiming that the plan combines Bluetooth low energy technology with privacy protection encryption technology to protect privacy Role.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, they also announced the core technical specifications used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">Apple and Google said the system is planned to be launched in three stages:</seg>
<seg id="49">Launched some tools to support the government to create an official coronavirus tracking application that protects privacy</seg>
<seg id="50">Integrating this function directly into iOS and Android systems, Google and Apple plan to launch the system through operating system updates first, and the system will be deleted in the same way after the outbreak threat to solve subsequent monitoring problems.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is the act of cleaning hands in order to remove dust, grease, microorganisms or other useless substances from the hands.</seg>
<seg id="2">Insist on washing your hands with soap at certain "critical moments" every day to prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which can be spread through the fecal-oral route.</seg>
<seg id="3">If people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, mucous membranes), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five key moments of washing hands with soap during the day: before and after bowel movements, after cleaning the childâs buttocks or after changing diapers, before feeding the child, before meals, before and after handling food, or before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you donât have soap and water, you can clean your hands with grass ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following situations:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after preparing food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Take care of the patient before and after.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing diapers or cleaning the hips of a child in the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="9">After wiping your nose, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching animals, animal food or animal feces.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medical staff hand hygiene refers to the hygiene habits related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Washing hands before issuing medicine or performing medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that may harm the human body or cause disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">For people engaged in food processing or working in the medical field, hand washing is particularly important, but for the public, hand washing is also very important.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are many health benefits of hand washing, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;</seg>
<seg id="16">And to reduce the infant mortality rate at home delivery.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study showed that improving hand-washing habits slightly promoted the height increase of children under five years of age.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, by promoting simple behavior changes (for example, washing hands with soap), child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="19">This simple behavior can reduce the mortality of the above diseases by nearly 50%.</seg>
<seg id="20">Advocating hand-washing as an intervention can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about a third, and its effect is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">Washing hands with soap can reduce diarrhea by 48%. As a spontaneous act in homes, schools and communities around the world, washing hands with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).</seg>
<seg id="22">As a major acute respiratory infection, pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children under five years of age. Pneumonia kills approximately 1.8 million children each year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">UNICEF says that compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, making soap-washing hands before meals and after going to the toilet into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives and reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half. Deaths caused by acute respiratory infections are reduced by a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">As part of the Water Supply, Sanitation and Personal Hygiene (WASH) project, other hygiene interventions are usually taken while advocating hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Washing hands can also prevent pustulosis, which is spread through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">Washing your hands will have a slight adverse effect, that is, frequent hand washing will cause dry skin and cause skin damage.</seg>
<seg id="28">A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy and chapped skin, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Excessive and frequent hand washing is also considered as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to reduce the fecal-oral spread of the disease, there are five key moments in the day when you wash your hands with soap: after going to the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning the child's buttocks (changing the diaper), before feeding the child, before meals and handling Before and after food or after handling raw meat, fish or raw poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">To prevent the spread of disease, you should also wash your hands in the correct way in the following situations: before and after handling incisions or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or wiping your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is very low.</seg>
<seg id="33">A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that 38.7% of households used soap to wash their hands. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest proportion at 97%; the United States was close to the average at 77%; China had the lowest at 23%. Now, in order to advocate the act of washing hands with soap at critical moments, several methods of changing behaviors have been implemented. In order to help children develop hand-washing habits, developing countries can choose to allow school children to wash their hands on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="34">The âBasic Health Care Planâ promoted by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is a model for large-scale initiatives to improve childrenâs health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">The core of this national plan is deworming twice a year, supplemented by daily hand washing with soap and brushing with fluoride toothpaste.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Indonesia, this plan has also been successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soap or detergent in the water can better remove microorganisms from the skin.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main functions of soaps and detergents are to reduce dissolution barriers and increase solubility.</seg>
<seg id="39">The use of water alone cannot effectively cleanse the skin, because fats and proteins (parts of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, cleaning and washing hands requires reasonable water...</seg>
<seg id="41">Because solid soap can be reused, it may retain the bacteria left over from previous use.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies have investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap, and concluded that bacteria cannot be transferred because they are washed away by foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, CDC still claims that "it is best to use non-contact liquid soap".</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial soap has been vigorously promoted among health-conscious people.</seg>
<seg id="45">So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in nature have been selected using recommended antibacterial or disinfectant agents.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soap contains common antimicrobial agents such as triclosan, which has a large number of resistant microorganism strains.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, even if antibacterial soap is not selected for antibiotic resistant strains, antibacterial soap may not be as effective as advertised.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to surfactants and skin care agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antibacterial active benzoic acid as pH adjusters, and more skin conditioners (aloe, vitamins, menthol, Plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health at the University of Oregon showed that ordinary soaps have the same effect as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria on hands.</seg>
<seg id="49">Washing hands with hot water is comfortable, but its heat is not enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria grow quickly at body temperature (37 Â°C).</seg>
<seg id="51">However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microbes on the hands, which is contrary to popular belief.</seg>
<seg id="53">Non-water-based hand sanitizers or disposable anti-bacterial hand sanitizers are non-aqueous hand cleaners.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early 2000s, non-aqueous alcohol-based hand cleansers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disposable antiseptic hand rubs or disposable hand sanitizers) were very popular.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most of these hand sanitizer formulations contain isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, and then add a thickener such as carbomer (acrylic polymer) to form a gel, or add a humectant such as glycerin to form a liquid, or form a foam for easy use. And relieve dry skin caused by alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide can further increase antibacterial activity. No-clean hand sanitizer containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol is effective for sterilization.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol hand rub can kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory tract) Syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">After 30 seconds of use, the alcohol rubbing liquid with 70% alcohol content can kill 99.97% of the bacteria on the hand (reduced by 3.5 orders of magnitude, which is similar to a reduction of 35 decibels). 99.999% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude) bacteria. No-clean hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria, but less effective for some viruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">Alcohol hand rubbing liquid has almost no effect on viruses such as norovirus (also known as Norwalk) (the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis). You must use enough disposable antiseptic hand sanitizer or alcohol hand rub to thoroughly wet or cover your hands.</seg>
<seg id="60">Rub the palms of the hands and back of the hands and between fingers and all finger ends for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.</seg>
<seg id="61">Fingertips must also be washed thoroughly, rubbing fingertips on both palms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands rather than using disposable hand rubs, especially if your hands look dirty.</seg>
<seg id="62">Because such hand rubs are easy to use and can quickly deactivate microorganisms, they are increasingly used; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.</seg>
<seg id="63">Frequent use of alcohol-free, hand-washing liquids can cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.</seg>
<seg id="64">Glycerin and/or other emollients can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate dry skin caused by alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, compared with soap or antibacterial cleansers, alcohol-free hand-washing liquids containing emollients can significantly reduce skin irritation and dry skin.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or allergies to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rub are rare.</seg>
<seg id="67">Compared with washing hands with soap and water, alcohol-free hand-washing liquid is less likely to induce irritant contact dermatitis, which is one of the reasons for its attractiveness.</seg>
<seg id="68">Although anhydrous cleaners are effective, they do not remove organic matter from your hands, but only disinfect them.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, no-clean hand sanitizer is less effective than soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, because these pathogens are still on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="70">The efficacy of alcohol-free leave-on hand sanitizers largely depends on the ingredients and formulations, and its effect has always been much worse than that of alcohol and alcohol hand rubs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Recently, the formulation using benzalkonium chloride has been proven to have sustained and cumulative antibacterial activity after use. This is different from alcohol. Alcohol has been shown to reduce its effect after repeated use, which may be due to gradually causing adverse effects. Skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use grass ash or soil instead.</seg>
<seg id="73">Grass ash or soil is worse than washing hands with water alone, but not as good as soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may accelerate the spread of disease rather than slow it down.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, grass ash is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it meets water.</seg>
<seg id="76">WHO recommends that if there is no soap available, you can use plant ash or sand instead of soap.</seg>
<seg id="77">The steps recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of disease are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="78">Wet your hands with running warm or cold water.</seg>
<seg id="79">The use of running water is recommended because the vertical basin may be contaminated, and the water temperature does not seem to matter much.</seg>
<seg id="80">Use a sufficient amount of soap to scrub repeatedly to produce foam, and at the same time wash the back of the hand, between fingers and between the nails.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes bacteria from the skin. Studies have shown that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap instead of washing their hands with water alone.</seg>
<seg id="82">Scrub for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Scrubbing produces friction, which helps remove bacteria from the skin. The longer the scrubbing time, the more bacteria are removed.</seg>
<seg id="84">Wash thoroughly with running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Washing hands with a basin will cause recontamination.</seg>
<seg id="86">Wipe dry with a clean towel or dry naturally.</seg>
<seg id="87">Wet hands are more likely to be recontaminated. The area between the thumb, wrist, finger, and nail seam are the most often overlooked areas.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may hide microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">It is generally recommended to use moisturizing lotions to avoid dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection transmission.</seg>
<seg id="90">Where tap water and/or soap is not available in developing countries, various low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, for example, pouring water through a hanging bucket or perforated gourd, and/or washing hands with grass and ash (if necessary) ). In the case of limited water supply (for example, schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving hand-washing schemes can be used, such as simple faucets and other low-cost methods.</seg>
<seg id="91">The technology of the simple faucet is very simple. Hang a jug with a rope, then pour a small amount of water on the hand through a foot pedal, and then use soap.</seg>
<seg id="92">Drying hands effectively is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there is still some debate about the most effective way to dry hands in public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="93">More and more research shows that paper towels are more hygienic than electric dryers provided in many bathrooms.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the tissue industry. The degree is compared.</seg>
<seg id="95">After washing your hands, use a warm air dryer to dry your hands. The average amount of bacteria on your fingers increased by 194%, and the total amount of bacteria on your palms increased by 254%.</seg>
<seg id="96">When using a hand dryer to dry hands, the total amount of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42%, and the total amount of bacteria on the palm increased by an average of 15%.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing your hands, dry your hands with paper towels, the average amount of bacteria on your fingers is reduced by 76%, and the total amount of palms is 77%. Scientists have also conducted various tests to determine whether various hand-drying methods may cause cross-infection in other toilet users and toilet facilities.</seg>
<seg id="98">It is said that the jet dryer sprays air at 180 meters/second (650 kilometers/hour; 400 miles per hour), which can blow away the microorganisms on the hands and the body, which may contaminate other toilets within 2 meters. And toilet facilities.</seg>
<seg id="99">Use a warm air dryer to spread microorganisms 0.25 meters away from the dryer.</seg>
<seg id="100">The results of using paper towels to dry hands show that there is no serious microbial transmission. In 2005, TÃV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate different ways of doing hands.</seg>
<seg id="101">After drying hands, the following changes in the number of bacteria were observed:</seg>
<seg id="102">The study involved many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and compared these hand dryers with paper towels.</seg>
<seg id="103">During travel, in the absence of soap and water, you can choose to use hand disinfection wipes to wash your hands.</seg>
<seg id="104">The alcohol content of alcohol-free hand sanitizer should be at least 60%.</seg>
<seg id="105">Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis) discovered in 1846 that hand washing can effectively prevent the spread of disease in the hospital, however, it was only after a long time before medical staff were forced to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="106">Hospitals use electronic devices that can provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="107">A study found that the infection rate decreased after using these devices.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical personnel should wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, and use sufficient soap and water or gel to wash the hands to create foam and rub all parts of the hands.</seg>
<seg id="109">Rub your fingers together.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is debris between the nails, you can use a hard brush to remove it.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since the residual moisture on the hands may still contain bacteria, it must be washed thoroughly and wiped dry with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying, use a paper towel to close the faucet (if necessary, use a paper towel to open the exit door).</seg>
<seg id="113">This prevents the hands from being contaminated again due to contact with these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">In medical and health institutions, the purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid spread.</seg>
<seg id="115">A report in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that in most medical settings, there are still cases where hand washing does not reach an acceptable level. A large number of medical staff often forget to wash hands before contacting patients, which leads to the spread of microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="116">One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infection rates by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a worksheet demonstrating standard hand washing and rubbing methods in medical institutions.</seg>
<seg id="117">The organization also posted a draft hand hygiene guide on its website for public comment.</seg>
<seg id="118">Whitby et al. conducted a related review.</seg>
<seg id="119">If you need to verify regulatory compliance, then commercial equipment can be measured and verified by hand hygiene.</seg>
<seg id="120">The "five moments" recommended by the World Health Organization:</seg>
<seg id="121">After exposure to blood/body fluids</seg>
<seg id="122">Before aseptic operation and</seg>
<seg id="123">After taking care of the patient. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap ("medicinal soap" or "antibacterial soap") can produce hand sanitizers.</seg>
<seg id="124">This sterilization procedure may be required before surgery or in an environment with a large number of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. When "scrubbing" hands for surgery, there must be a faucet that can be opened and closed without contact, a hand sanitizer containing chlorhexidine or iodine, a sterile towel used to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing And other sterile tools for cleaning nail seams.</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewelry must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing hands, forearms and elbows, usually for 2â6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">There is no need to scrub for a long time (10 minutes).</seg>
<seg id="128">When rinsing, the water on the forearm must be prevented from flowing back to the hand.</seg>
<seg id="129">After washing your hands, use a sterile cloth to dry your hands and put on your surgical gown.</seg>
<seg id="130">In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, it is best to wash your hands before or after contacting the patient or use no-clean sterilizing hand sanitizer.</seg>
<seg id="131">In order to control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning comes from when the frequency of hand washing reaches 20%. When the frequency of hand cleaning increases to more than 35%, further benefits are extremely limited.</seg>
<seg id="132">Compared with the use of antibacterial soaps, washing hands with ordinary soaps will result in a three-fold increase in the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food. Comparing hand rubbing with alcohol hand rub and hand washing with antibacterial soap (30 seconds each), the percentage of bacterial infections using alcohol hand rub was 26% lower than that of antibacterial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, to reduce the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores on hands, soap and water are more effective than alcohol hand rubs. Interventions such as training employees on how to wash their hands, increasing the supply of alcohol hand rubbing liquid, and giving written and oral reminders to employees can improve hand hygiene in medical institutions.</seg>
<seg id="134">For which interventions are most effective in various medical settings, further research is needed.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered a cost-effective tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, peopleâs homes, schools and workplaces lack reliable water supplies, soap or hand-washing facilities, which makes popularizing hand-washing practices a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there is a cheap way to build a hand-washing station, it is very rare to have a hand-washing faucet near each private toilet or public toilet.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be due to deep-rooted habits, not because of a lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and advocating the use of soap for hand washing can influence policy formulation, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioral changes for residents.</seg>
<seg id="140">To be effective, it must be monitored and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic evaluation of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective in increasing the proportion of hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), while social marketing activities are less effective. An example of advocating hand washing in schools is the âSamsung Methodâ promoted by UNICEF. Among other hygiene requirements, schools are encouraged to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="142">When the minimum standard is reached, the school can rise from one star to the highest three.</seg>
<seg id="143">Hand washing promotion activities may include the construction of hand washing stations to reduce disease and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">Another example of raising hand-washing awareness activities is World Hand Washing Day, which aims to try to achieve behavioral changes. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of an emoji for hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="145">Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing and DALY in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="146">However, there are reports showing that the cost-effectiveness of advocating hand washing with soap is more significant than other water and sanitation interventions.</seg>
<seg id="147">The earliest recognized the importance of hand washing for human health-especially for those who are weak (for example, a mother in a hospital just after giving birth or an injured soldier), were two pioneers in the field of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".</seg>
<seg id="148">At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by a stench called malaria.</seg>
<seg id="149">The outbreak of foodborne diseases and iatrogenic infections in the 1980s prompted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene, emphasizing that hand hygiene is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, in Germany, posters of "correct hand washing methods" will be hung next to the sinks in public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets.</seg>
<seg id="152">The idiom "wash your hands and don't do it" means that someone declares that they are unwilling to take responsibility or participate in something.</seg>
<seg id="153">It is derived from the content of the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible. Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus, and later evolved into a widely used idiom in some English-speaking groups.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth began to force her hands to wash in order to clean up the imaginary stains, indicating that she felt guilty about the crimes she committed and her husband's crimes.</seg>
<seg id="155">Studies have shown that people who think of or conceive of unethical behavior tend to wash their hands more often than others, and often cherish their hand-washing facilities.</seg>
<seg id="156">In addition, those who can wash their hands after envisaging unethical behavior are less likely to engage in other âpurifyingâ compensation actions, such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">Religion requires washing hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand-washing with water but no soap when washing hands is part of the iconic hand-washing ceremony of many religions, including bathing (tevilah) and hand-washing (netilat yadayim) cleansing in the Bahaâi faith, Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity. Hand washing and small nets in Islam. Religion also has hygienic hand washing regulations, especially after certain behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after going to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after meals.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths , Causing a huge human disaster.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to become infected with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than SARS, it is more spreadable, affecting more elderly people than young people and more men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In view of the rapid increase in publications related to New Coronary Pneumonia, this article intends to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly developing research topic.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will introduce basic knowledge about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory of the Chinese people. The outbreak of a new viral disease forced everyone to stay at home throughout the holidays and the subsequent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="8">This virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV on February 11, 2020 -2, the related disease is called Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country, and then spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.</seg>
<seg id="11">WHO warns that COVID-19 has become the "number one public enemy" and its threat may exceed terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to data from PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months have passed since the first report of the isolation of viral sequences from multiple patients on January 7, 2020 More than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published, covering virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">This article aims to summarize the research progress in this emerging discipline.</seg>
<seg id="14">People are used to comparing COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some urgent issues that have yet to be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past, CoV has been considered to be a non-fatal pathogen in humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds4.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, this century has encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which broke out in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries. Prevalence and mortality.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, the COVID-19 epidemic is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in Figure 1,1, Wuhan City first reported multiple unexplained cases of pneumonia to the China National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the CoV sequence was announced.</seg>
<seg id="21">On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, the medical staff was reported to be infected, suggesting that there may be person-to-person transmission.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, Wuhan closed its city and closed all public transportation.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, the first clinical study on new coronary pneumonia reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan South China Seafood Market, which is considered the starting point for infections of unknown animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency."</seg>
<seg id="27">As of the publication of this report, the disease has spread to nearly 50 other countries in China and around the world (Figure 2 (Fig. 2)).</seg>
<seg id="28">Due to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and severity of the outbreak have yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided updated instructions for this epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin. qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages, but the main age group is 30-65 years old.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons are over 50 years old, very few are under 20 years old, and only 14 infected persons are under 10 years old.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 infected more males (0.31 per 100,000) than females (0.27 per 100,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 mainly spreads in Hubei and surrounding areas.</seg>
<seg id="34">COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.</seg>
<seg id="37">The basic regeneration number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincided with the large-scale population migration time before the Spring Festival in China.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality rate of confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (â¥60 years) and severe pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">CoV is a large family of enveloped viruses containing single-sense strand RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four genera, namely Î±, Î², Î³, and Î´, of which Î±-CoV and Î²-CoV are known to infect humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">The envelope spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV binds to its cell receptors angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and then membrane fusion occurs.</seg>
<seg id="44">The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is replicated, the genomic RNA forms enveloped vesicles containing virions together with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then fuse with the plasma membrane and release the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">As a result, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of Î²-CoV. Among the 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan City where the outbreak occurred, the genetic identity exceeded 99.98%.</seg>
<seg id="47">Compared with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultrathin sections of human airway epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="49">The study found that human ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, compared with SARS-CoV, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a weaker binding capacity to human ACE2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes the infection severity of patients to be lower than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNÎ²; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or motifs.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of a full-length human ACE2 complexed with amino acid transporter B0AT1 with a resolution of 2.9 Ã.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that the complex has an open and closed conformation and is assembled into a dimer. The ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, thus providing evidence of CoV recognition and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and intermediate host</seg>
<seg id="57">As we all know, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and spread to humans through civet cats and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">By comparing the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the natural host of SARS-CoV-2, because this new virus and the two SARS-like CoVs from bats-named bat-SL- CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21-with 96% consistency.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it is unclear what intermediate host helps the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans, and its transmission route remains to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="60">Ji et al. proposed that snakes are virus carriers from bats to humans, which involves homologous recombination within the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China believe that given that a CoV found in pangolins, a long-nosed anteater often used in Chinese medicine, is 99% genetically homologous to SARS-CoV-2 Therefore, pangolins are considered as potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a huge difference; therefore, specific evidence is still needed to provide decisive results (Fig. 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unclear.</seg>
<seg id="64">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment, and can survive for up to 5 days at 20 Â°C and 40%-50% humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.</seg>
<seg id="66">According to reports, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat-56 Â°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents can effectively inactivate viruses, but chlorine It has been determined that the virus cannot be effectively inactivated.</seg>
<seg id="67">Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to this new virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">At present, there is no detailed research report on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).4).</seg>
<seg id="70">In general, after a virus invades a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), and NOD-like receptors ( NLR) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).</seg>
<seg id="71">Viruses induce inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis through different pathways. They limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus get rid of the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="73">The adaptive immune response will soon join the fight against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected by the virus.</seg>
<seg id="76">Helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help these defense cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.</seg>
<seg id="78">Humoral immunity, including complementâsuch as C3a and C5aâand antibodies is also essential to fight viral infections.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients can neutralize MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system will produce a large amount of free radicals locally, these free radicals may cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, in the worst case, it will lead to multiple organ failure or even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by clustered disease, is more likely to affect the elderly and pregnant women with multiple comorbidities.</seg>
<seg id="82">Usually, individuals exposed to large amounts of viruses or immunocompromised individuals are more likely to develop infections than others.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to a study conducted on the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, and most of them are 3-7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and the range was 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that according to the demographics of 8,866 cases, the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="86">For the health department, it is very important to adjust the effective isolation time according to the most accurate incubation period, so as to prevent the asymptomatic infected person from transmitting the virus to others.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a general rule, people who are in contact with or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">Fever is usually the main and first symptom of COVID-19. It may be free of any other symptoms and may be accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset.</seg>
<seg id="91">In severe cases, it will rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.</seg>
<seg id="92">Even if there are no abnormalities in lung imaging, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for viruses for early diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of various symptoms was: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55%, diarrhea 3%; 8% of patients require ventilation support.</seg>
<seg id="94">Two recent studies on family clustering and asymptomatic individual transmission leading to clustering have reported similar results.</seg>
<seg id="95">In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of these patients require ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with the higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="98">In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13 -25%) have been demonstrated ) Is the main symptom, about 14%-20% of patients need ventilation support.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of February 14, there have been 66,576 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, with a mortality rate of 2%.</seg>
<seg id="100">In contrast, as of November 2002, the mortality rate of SARS in 8,096 confirmed cases was 10%.</seg>
<seg id="101">For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.</seg>
<seg id="102">An early study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.</seg>
<seg id="103">Table 1.1 lists the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above data shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher diffusion capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but lethality is lower than the latter two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">Clustered onset usually occurs in the same family, or from the same party or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other epidemic areas within the last two weeks before the onset of illness, or a history of close contact with infected persons or patients.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients who have been discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, thereby issuing an alarm to prolong the isolation time.</seg>
<seg id="109">The number of peripheral blood leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in patients in the early stages of the disease was normal or decreased.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, leukopenia and aspartate aminotransferase levels of white blood cell count &amp;lt; 4Ã109/L including lymphocyte count &amp;lt; 1Ã109/L were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients Elevated and viremia.</seg>
<seg id="111">Some patients can see elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients can see elevated blood C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</seg>
<seg id="112">In severe patients, blood fibrin degradation product D-dimer levels are increased and lymphocyte counts are progressively reduced.</seg>
<seg id="113">Most patients with COVID-19 have abnormal chest imaging, which is characterized by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass shadows of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="115">When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis can severely impair gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">Type I and type II alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">Therefore, the worst chest imaging findings usually appear at the same time as the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, COVID-19's first pathological analysis revealed alveolar epithelial cell shedding, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease. The pathology of infection and ARDS is consistent and similar to SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main diagnostic standard for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, because the higher false negative rate may accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical manifestations for diagnosis on February 13, 2020 (instead of relying solely on RT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="121">A similar situation occurred when diagnosing SARS.</seg>
<seg id="122">Therefore, combining medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and imaging results is essential for an effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, the team of Zhang Feng reported a protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology. This protocol does not require complicated instruments and can use a test strip in less than an hour Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments with concentrations of only 20 Ã 10-18 mol/L to 200 Ã 10-18 mol/L (10-100 virus copies per microliter) were detected.</seg>
<seg id="124">If verified in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to greatly improve the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience in the treatment of new CoV, doctors mainly provide support treatment for patients with COVID-19, while trying to use or propose for other CoVs-such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-and various other viral diseases Therapy (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These therapies include current and potential treatments, such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is even recommended to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning, and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">Nonetheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the main threats to patients and the main cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="131">Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including conventional oxygen inhalation, high flow oxygen inhalation, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.</seg>
<seg id="134">It is well known that overexpression of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS can cause cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="135">Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IFNÎ±, IFNÎ², IFNÎ³, and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is the main reason for ARDS and multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in critically ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="138">Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immunosuppressive therapies against cytokine storms include: regulation of T cell directed immune responses; blockade of IFN-Î³, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; bonatuzumab; cytokine signaling inhibitor 4; and HDAC Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="140">Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, high-dose steroids are not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="142">On the contrary, they may cause serious side effects, especially ischemic osteonecrosis, thereby seriously affecting the prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nonetheless, it is recommended that patients with severe COVID-19 be cautiously treated with short- and medium-dose corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, it has been found that reduxil, a nucleotide analog, administered intravenously to a COVID-19 patient in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="146">Redoxir is a new type of antiviral drug developed by Gilead. It was originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola virus and Marburg virus.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, it was also proved that redoxivir may inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">For these reasons, Gilead has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, and the results are promising.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, the use of barectinib, alpha-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin has been suggested as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">After combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma and antibody production in recovered patients</seg>
<seg id="153">It has a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from being infected with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="154">In fact, patients who have recovered usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies. They recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this principle, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and then injected into 10 critically ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, while inflammation and viral load were reduced, and blood oxygen saturation was increased.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, before developing specific therapies, it is necessary to verify and clarify to propose methods that can be used on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, considering the therapeutic effect, some disadvantages related to plasma should be carefully considered.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome. This toxic reaction can be life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma requirements for treating critically ill patients are high.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Therefore, a more critical and practical method is to isolate B cells from the recovered patients and identify the genetic code encoding effective antibodies, or to screen for effective antibodies against proteins necessary for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">In this way, we can easily expand the scale of antibody production.</seg>
<seg id="165">In China, TCM has been used to treat various diseases for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its therapeutic effect depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple ingredients in the prescription, and the prescription of disease diagnosis according to TCM theory is different.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most active ingredients are still unknown or ambiguous because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their optimal combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">At present, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, Shufeng Jiedu capsules and Lianhua Qingwen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="170">In several provinces of China, 87% of patients were treated with TCM, among which the highest cure rate of COVID-19 patients was observed, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province only TCM was used in approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients, and the cure rate was the lowest (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is only a rough comparison because many other influencing factors should be included in the assessment, such as the number and severity of patients.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18, 2020, Zhang Boli and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with WM and TCM combination treatment.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the time required for recovery of temperature, disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization in the WM+TCM group was significantly shorter than in the WM group alone.</seg>
<seg id="174">Most impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (from light to heavy) in the WM+TCM group was significantly lower than in the WM alone group (7.4% vs 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was also lower than in the WM alone group (8.8% versus 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">Nonetheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still require higher quality controlled trials, a larger scope, and more centers to confirm.</seg>
<seg id="176">It will also be of interest to characterize the mechanism of action of TCM therapy or its combination and to clarify its active ingredients when possible.</seg>
<seg id="177">Most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 will have great fears due to this highly contagious and even fatal disease, and those who are quarantined will also feel depressed, lonely and angry.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, and adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.</seg>
<seg id="179">A series of psychological reactions were reported in the early stages of the SARS outbreak, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitability, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide.</seg>
<seg id="180">As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracking and isolation can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, isolation and stigma on their family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients with COVID-19, suspected cases, close contacts, and the public in need.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include the establishment of a multi-disciplinary mental health team, regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans for clear communication, and the use of professional electronic equipment and applications to avoid close contact.</seg>
<seg id="183">An effective vaccine is essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from animal hosts and infected patients to susceptible hosts, and is often used as a complementary means of antiviral therapy in controlling the outbreak caused by emerging viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">The industry has worked hard to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in SARS animal models.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, prior to the initiation of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the elderly and lethal attack models and their protective effects on zoonotic virus infections have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is most likely because SARS disappeared as early as 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.</seg>
<seg id="188">In contrast, due to the continued existence of zoonotic disease in epidemic areas, sporadic cases and clustering of MERS persist in the Middle East and spread to other regions.</seg>
<seg id="189">Through the use of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.</seg>
<seg id="190">The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the current epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, due to the long time required for vaccine development (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in CoV, overcoming this difficulty is challenging.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its complete clinical process in thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 severe patients also have a high morbidity and mortality.</seg>
<seg id="195">Therefore, establishing a prognostic model for this disease is essential for health care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="196">According to the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age is the most important factor influencing the prognosis of SARS, as is COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">As mentioned earlier, in a study involving 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurred in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7% of patients were over 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients who require intensive care are more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and are significantly older than patients who do not require intensive care (median age 66 years vs. 51 years), suggesting a prognosis for patients with COVID-19 age factor.</seg>
<seg id="200">Gender: As mentioned earlier, there are more men infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.31 per 100,000 versus 0.27 per 100,000).</seg>
<seg id="201">Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injury and arrhythmia.</seg>
<seg id="202">Heart events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="203">According to reports, SARS-CoV-2 can also be combined with ACE2 positive bile duct cells, which may lead to abnormal liver function in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may affect each other.</seg>
<seg id="205">Abnormal laboratory test results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been regarded as a potential prognostic factor for disease, treatment response, and eventual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">Others have suggested that CRP levels are correlated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.</seg>
<seg id="209">Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Main clinical symptoms: Chest imaging examination and time progress of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="211">Use of steroids: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immunosuppressive agents and are usually used as an adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="212">Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffer from ischemic osteonecrosis, leading to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients in small doses and for short periods of time.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under great pressure because they often suffered long-term isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of relatives and patients.</seg>
<seg id="215">Psychological counseling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get rid of stress and resume normal life.</seg>
<seg id="216">Based on the demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or asymptomatic symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, the infected people will produce a lot of viruses in the daily activities in the early stage or incubation period, which brings great difficulties to the control of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, the spread of SARS-CoV is thought to occur when the patient is seriously ill, and most of the spread does not occur in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="220">Therefore, compared with SARS, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more serious and difficult to control.</seg>
<seg id="221">China is currently making tremendous efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and surrounding cities, and the continued isolation of almost all populations, with a view to interrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these measures have caused serious damage to China's economy and other areas, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the rate of development of the epidemic is slowing.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, some other experts are not so optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Ira Longini et al. established a model to predict the consequences of the epidemic and believed that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two thirds of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A Canadian team reported that patients who recovered and were discharged 2 weeks ago detected SARS-CoV-2 in both middle turbinate and pharyngeal swabs, indicating that this newly discovered virus may become a periodic epidemic similar to the flu .</seg>
<seg id="228">However, as the number of new cases has decreased, China has shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.</seg>
<seg id="229">The Ebola virus has been predicted to cause 1 million cases and cause 500,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="230">However, through strict isolation, the disease was finally controlled.</seg>
<seg id="231">Similar to SARS-CoV, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may become weaker and eventually disappear or coexist with the human body as a less pathogenic virus.</seg>
<seg id="232">The following provides a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Fig. 55).</seg>
<seg id="233">SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be spread by coughing or sneezing, or even by direct contact with objects contaminated by the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">This virus has also been found in feces, which increases the possibility of fecal spread.</seg>
<seg id="235">A recent study involving 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases may have been caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients who previously had other diseases and 40 medical staff.</seg>
<seg id="236">Therefore, stricter precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially medical staff, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have had contact with patients or infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing a mask; using surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) can help control the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks can prevent droplets from potential infections from spreading in the air or sticking to the surface of items that may be passed on to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only N95 (1860s series) masks can prevent the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate completely; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV, both are about 85 nm.</seg>
<seg id="240">Because virus particles can even penetrate five surgical masks stacked together, medical personnel in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks, not surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, medical personnel should also wear isolation suits to further reduce contact with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="242">The virus can also spread through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, medical personnel should wear transparent masks or goggles when facing patients.</seg>
<seg id="245">For the public affected by the epidemic or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that everyone use disinfectant soap to wash their hands more frequently than usual, try to stay indoors to isolate themselves, and limit contact with potential infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="246">Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from patients.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new type of virus, based on the profound memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak, its high homology with SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020 should have caused China is highly alert.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention was still appeasing the citizens, saying that the new virus is not very contagious, the possibility of person-to-person transmission is limited, and the epidemic is preventable and controllable.</seg>
<seg id="250">This news obviously eased the public's vigilance, and as the Spring Festival approached, the key node to contain the epidemic in Wuhan was thus missed.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's disease control agencies may learn this painful lesson and make major improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, these institutions should (1) be more cautious when issuing announcements, because every word is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to abnormal information from hospitals, and Rather than waiting for a formal report from a doctor or official; (3) Strictly control potential outbreaks at an early stage rather than trying to appease the public; and (4) Conduct targeted and effective drills more frequently to increase public awareness of epidemics Recognize and regularly test and improve social response systems.</seg>
<seg id="253">The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">At the time of writing, in less than two months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="255">Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 looks like a SARS recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the outbreak and treating patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">The elderly affected by COVID-19 are more than young people, more men than women, and the severity and mortality of elderly patients are also higher than young patients.</seg>
<seg id="258">SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).</seg>
<seg id="259">Even if there are no symptoms, COVID-19 patients can still spread the virus, and SARS patients usually only spread the virus when the condition is serious, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This part explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads far more quickly and widely than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">In some COVID-19 patients, the SARS-CoV-2 routine RNA test may be negative.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, patients who have been cured may turn positive again.</seg>
<seg id="263">These findings greatly increase the risk of virus transmission.</seg>
<seg id="264">Considering that the research on COVID-19 is so rapid, the following key issues still need to be resolved:</seg>
<seg id="265">Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?</seg>
<seg id="266">Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two bat SARS-like CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal is the intermediate host that spreads the virus from the original hostâassumed to be a batâto humans?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off the route of transmission, and the outbreak may recur at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Although molecular models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Will the virus also bind cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">If there is no clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the epidemic last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus evolve in the process of passing from person to person?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it become a global pandemic? Disappear like SARS? Or will it recur regularly like the flu?</seg>
<seg id="275">Finding answers to these and many other questions is crucial, but it may take a long time.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, no matter what the cost is, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="2">Although no vaccines have completed clinical trials, many attempts to develop such vaccines are still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="3">In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a pathogenic virus, is expected to appear within 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In April, five candidate vaccines entered the Phase I safety study.</seg>
<seg id="5">COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2020, a large-scale epidemic spread globally, triggering a lot of investment and research activities in vaccine development.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations are using the published viral genomes to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="8">CEPI proposed a vaccine development plan in April and stated that the top priorities are speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global availability.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were researching and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main platform targets entering Phase I safety research include:</seg>
<seg id="11">Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developers and candidate vaccines: Moderna, mRNA-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">Viral vector (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5)</seg>
<seg id="13">CEPI scientists reported in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as ongoing projects (79 according to Milken Institute data) and 37 have been announced, But there is almost no public information (presumably planning or designing).</seg>
<seg id="14">Phase I-II trials carry out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-site trials, while determining more accurate and effective doses.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse reactions at the optimal dose.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not been evaluated in humans (still in "preclinical" studies).</seg>
<seg id="17">Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia announced that it is studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that can genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of vaccine development with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Hong Kong announced vaccine development projects on January 26 and January 28, 2020, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="20">Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun vaccine development.</seg>
<seg id="21">Janssen is working with its biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">ACE2 inhibits the activity of related angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) by reducing the content of angiotensin II and increasing the content of Ang(1-7), and is expected to become a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronaviruses to enter the cell.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of this enzyme is commonly referred to as hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal Collectrin kidney amino acid transporter domain.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein with its enzyme active domain exposed on the cell surface of the lung and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another enzyme called shedding enzyme (sheddase) cleaves the extracellular domain of ACE2 from the transmembrane domain, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood and eventually excreted into the urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 attaches to the cell membrane, mainly type II alveolar cells of the lung, intestinal epithelial cells of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells of most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="9">ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main function of ACE2 is to check and balance ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE cleaves angiotensin I into angiotensin II with vasoconstrictor activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2 then cleaves the carboxy-terminal amino acid phenylalanine of Angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to angiotensin with vasodilator activity (1-7 ), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also cleave many other peptides, including desarginine 9 bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 can also regulate the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19, and it is related to Harnt's disease (Hartnup).</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronaviruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (viruses that cause SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (viruses that cause COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">More specifically, the S1 spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bind to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface, leading to endocytosis, which causes the virus and enzyme to translocate into the endosome inside the cell.</seg>
<seg id="17">This entry process also requires the activation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, and the inhibition of this process is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic method. Some people speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, several professional associations and regulatory agencies recommend continuing to use standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.</seg>
<seg id="19">A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "compared to the control group, the use of ACE inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of pneumonia by 34%."</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, "for patients with a higher risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure, treatment with ACE inhibitors will also reduce the risk of pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but the results are not as reliable as reducing the overall risk of pneumonia. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered to be a new method for the treatment of acute lung injury, and it seems to improve the pulmonary hemodynamic indexes and blood oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharide.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life of rhACE2 in the human body is about 10 hours, the onset time is 30 minutes, and the course of action (duration) is 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some research results indicate that rhACE2 may be a very useful for patients who are intolerant to classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or diseases with elevated levels of circulating angiotensin II Prospects for drugs. The efficacy of rhACE2 infusion on acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019-2020 coronavirus epidemic is a continuously spreading 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and was listed as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as an epidemic on March 11, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="3">As of April 10, 2020, 210 countries and regions in the world have reported a total of about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases, and about 97,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 364,000 people were cured.</seg>
<seg id="5">The case fatality rate in China is about 4%, while the case fatality rate in various regions of the world is between 0.08% (New Zealand) and 13.04% (Algeria).</seg>
<seg id="6">Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">It may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incubation period from contact with the patient to onset ranges from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinical treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. Recommended precautions include washing hands frequently, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a safe distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspected infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="11">Official agencies of various countries have taken measures such as travel restrictions, isolation, curfews, workplace hazard prevention and control, and facility closures.</seg>
<seg id="12">The epidemic has caused a severe impact on the global social economy, sports, religious, political and cultural activities have been postponed or cancelled, and panic shopping has exacerbated the widespread supply shortage.</seg>
<seg id="13">National or local suspension measures have been implemented in 193 countries and regions around the world, affecting about 99.4% of primary and secondary school and college students.</seg>
<seg id="14">Due to the dissemination of false viral information on the Internet, there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against the Chinese, other East Asian and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance groups, and groups in severe epidemic areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, reduced travel and heavy industry closures have lowered the air pollution index and reduced carbon emissions.</seg>
<seg id="16">On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China notified a group of cases of unexplained pneumonia and initiated an investigation in early January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most of these cases are related to the South China seafood wholesale market, so the new coronavirus is considered to be zoonotic.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that caused this outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The earliest discovered patient was later confirmed to have onset on December 1, 2019, and has no obvious connection with a batch of cases in the South China Seafood Market that appeared later.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of the early cases notified in December 2019, two-thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China seafood market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report that the first case may be traced back to November 17, 2019. The patient is a 55-year-old male from Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, according to the World Health Organization report, the number of newly reported cases in China declined, but the number of newly reported cases in Italy, Iran, and South Korea suddenly increased, and the number of new cases outside China exceeded the territory for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="21">There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially mild cases.</seg>
<seg id="22">As of February 26, there were relatively few reported cases of adolescents, and the proportion of adolescents aged 19 and younger in the world was only 2.4%. Patrick Valence, the UKâs chief scientific adviser, estimates that about 60% of the population in the UK needs to be infected with the new coronavirus in order to be effectively immunized.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and confirmed to be positive according to the official protocol.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of March 23, the proportion of countries in the world that have been tested did not exceed 3% of the total population. Many countries have also issued official policies for not testing mild people, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="25">A study published on March 16 pointed out that as of January 23, it is estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infected people in China have not been tested, and these unrecorded infections are the source of infection in 79% of recorded cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, the actual number of infections in Italy far exceeds the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">The basic transmission number (R0) of COVID-19 was originally estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control indicates that R0 may be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most patients with COVID-19 can recover.</seg>
<seg id="30">The time from onset to death for patients who cannot recover is 6-41 days, with 14 days being the most common.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 people died of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China were people over the age of 60, and 75% of deaths were accompanied by underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official statistics of COVID-19 deaths usually refer to patients who died according to the official protocol and tested positive for the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may far exceed statistical data, because the data may not include untested patients, such as patients who died at home, nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times that of the official statistics of deaths from the new coronavirus pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said frankly: "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number", and rumors about the underestimation of US data also confirm this statement. Underestimation often occurs in the field of epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. On January 9, 2020, Wuhan saw the first confirmed death in China.</seg>
<seg id="36">On February 1, the first death case outside China appeared in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first death case outside Asia appeared in France.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of February 28, outside China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each had more than 10 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="38">As of March 13, deaths have been reported in more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica. There are several methods commonly used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="39">These numbers vary from region to region and will change over time, and are affected by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time of the first outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health status. The case fatality rate is the number of deaths in a given period divided by the number of diagnoses.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).</seg>
<seg id="41">The case fatality rate is different in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the estimated case fatality rate has dropped from 17.3% (patients with onset from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (patients with onset after February 1, 2020). Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR). The former reflects the percentage of deaths from disease to the number of diagnoses, and the latter reflects the deaths from disease to the number of infections (including confirmed and undiagnosed) Number of people).</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics have no time limit, and track the entire process from infection to case resolution for a specific population.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many scholars try to calculate the above data for a specific group of people.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to estimates from the Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Center, the overall infection mortality rate for this outbreak is between 0.1% and 0.39%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The upper limit of the estimated value of this range is consistent with the first random test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis study on the impact of the test on the estimated value of CFR.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization claims that the outbreak is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and will vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni from Penn State University pointed out: "If left unchecked, infectious disease outbreaks usually enter a stagnation period after existing hosts are exhausted, and then begin to ease.</seg>
<seg id="50">But at present, it is almost impossible to reasonably predict when the inflection point will occur. "</seg>
<seg id="51">Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, believes that if all countries mobilize and adopt the recommendations of the World Health Organization to take measures to stop the spread of the virus, then âthe end of the epidemic in June can be expectedâ.</seg>
<seg id="52">On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "may be repeated outbreaks, lasting one to two years."</seg>
<seg id="53">Research led by Neil Ferguson at Imperial College of Technology shows that âbefore the vaccine is put into use (which may take 18 months or more),â it is important to maintain physical distance and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said: "This coronavirus is very spreadable, and I think it is unlikely to disappear completely." "It may evolve into a seasonal disease that occurs once a year."</seg>
<seg id="55">The pathogenicity of the second outbreak depends on the population's immunity and the degree of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some infected people may be asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (phlegm), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. According to the World Health Organization, about one-sixth of patients will become severe and have difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="59">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists dyspnoea, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips as emergency symptoms; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">Some infected people may be asymptomatic and have no clinical manifestations, but the test results are positive, so the researchers recommend close observation and examination of close contacts of confirmed patients to rule out the possibility of infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">China estimates the rate of asymptomatic infections ranges from extremely low to 44%.</seg>
<seg id="62">The incubation period (the time interval from infection to onset) is generally 1-14 days; 5 days is the most common. The uncertainty can be illustrated by an example: the proportion of COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell was initially estimated to be 30%, and later decreased to 15%.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details about the route of transmission of the disease have not yet been determined.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is currently believed that the disease is mainly spread by close contact and droplets generated when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is within 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) of each other.</seg>
<seg id="65">The study found that unobstructed cough may cause droplets to travel as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (15-27 feet).</seg>
<seg id="66">It has also been suggested that the droplets generated when people speak in the air may also cause the virus to spread for a longer period of time. Although the virus is usually unable to spread through the air, when people exhale or talk, they may also produce droplets.</seg>
<seg id="67">Such droplets may fall into the mouth and nose of people around them, or even be sucked into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may nebulize respiratory secretions and cause airborne transmission.</seg>
<seg id="69">In addition, if a person touches a virus-contaminated surface (including the skin), and then touches his eyes, nose, and mouth, the virus may also spread.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but this risk is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 fecal spread. The virus is most infectious in the first three days after onset, but it is also infectious before and after the onset.</seg>
<seg id="72">A positive result can be detected as early as three days before the onset of illness, which indicates that the new coronavirus is already contagious before showing obvious symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory, some countries have discovered asymptomatic infections during the follow-up investigation of contacts.</seg>
<seg id="74">The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet fully clear, generally 1 person can infect 2-3 people. The survival time of the virus on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="75">Specifically, it is known that the new coronavirus can survive up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and four hours on copper.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature. There have been cases of pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is currently no evidence that animals will reinfect the virus to humans, but the British official agency still recommends that people wash their hands after touching the animals, just like touching other surfaces that may be touched by infected people.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of virus that was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature. Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with household soap, because the soap can dissolve the protective capsule of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is currently regarded as zoonotic.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis shows that this coronavirus is genetically clustered with the Î²-coronavirus genus Sarbecovirus (genus B) and two bat-derived virus strains.</seg>
<seg id="82">The new coronavirus and other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) are 96% identical at the genome-wide level.</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that the virus in the pangolin and the virus in the human body differ by only one amino acid in some parts of the genome sequence.</seg>
<seg id="84">The whole genome comparison so far has found that at most 92% of the genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is not enough to prove that the pangolin is an intermediate host.</seg>
<seg id="85">Whether the virus is infected can be initially diagnosed according to the symptoms, but ultimately it must be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretions.</seg>
<seg id="86">A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but the specificity is low, and many imaging features will coincide with other pneumonia and disease development processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that âCT should not be used to screen for COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease.â</seg>
<seg id="88">The World Health Organization has announced a number of nucleic acid detection solutions for SARS-CoV-2. The first solution was released on January 17.</seg>
<seg id="89">Nucleic acid detection uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="90">Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for testing.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results can generally be obtained within hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="92">In general, this test is performed by nasopharyngeal swabs, but also by pharyngeal swabs. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests for detecting antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of April 6, 2020, none of these testing methods proved to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the United States, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use by certified laboratories in emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="95">Typical X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging features of the onset patient include peripheral ground glass asymmetry and no pleural effusion.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for the imaging manifestations of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to the coincidence with other viral infections (such as adenovirus), images not confirmed by PCR have limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="98">A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR results and found that although the image is less specific for identifying infections, the detection speed is faster and more sensitive, so it can be considered as a screening method in popular areas .</seg>
<seg id="99">At present, a convolutional neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed, which can use X-ray and CT to detect the image characteristics of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="100">Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth without washing your hands, covering your mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing, and throwing used tissues directly into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="101">Suspected infected persons should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.</seg>
<seg id="102">It is also recommended to take measures to maintain physical distance to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have restricted or suggested avoiding trips to countries and regions affected by the epidemic in non-essential situations.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has now reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some community residents have no way of knowing where or how they were infected. Medical personnel who come into contact with suspected infected persons should take standard precautions, exposure precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important means for the health supervision department to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.</seg>
<seg id="105">The government's use of mobile phone positioning data for tracking purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations such as Amnesty International issued a statement calling for restrictions on such supervision.</seg>
<seg id="106">At present, various mobile applications have been put into use or entered into proposals for people to use voluntarily. As of April 7, 2020, a total of more than ten expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection functions, such as using Bluetooth to record users and The distance between other phones.</seg>
<seg id="107">Once the user has had close contact with a patient who has a positive COVID-19 test result, they will receive an information reminder. Errors about preventing infection continue to spread; such as rinsing the nose and gargle with mouthwash are ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is recommended to wash hands frequently to prevent the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="110">The US Centers for Disease Control recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when there is obvious dirt on their hands, before meals, and after blowing their noses, coughing, or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is because before the virus enters the human body, it only needs to use household soap to destroy its protective capsule, thus playing a role in killing the virus.</seg>
<seg id="112">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends that if soap and tap water are not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% to wash your hands.</seg>
<seg id="113">The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth without washing their hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">The surface of the object can be disinfected with a variety of solutions (disinfectant can be effective within one minute of the stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 -7.5% povidone iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other solutions (such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate) are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The US Centers for Disease Control recommends that if a suspected or confirmed case of new coronavirus pneumonia occurs in facilities such as offices or day care centers, all areas should be disinfected, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, and shared electronic equipment such as tablets and touch screens , Keyboard, remote control, and ATMs used by patients.</seg>
<seg id="117">WHO recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with curved elbows or tissues when coughing or sneezing, and immediately dispose of all contaminated tissues.</seg>
<seg id="118">It is recommended that the suspected infected person wear a medical surgical mask, because wearing a mask can reduce the amount of droplets exhaled when speaking, sneezing and coughing and shorten the distance of transmission.</seg>
<seg id="119">The World Health Organization has issued instructions on where and how to use the mask.</seg>
<seg id="120">Virologist Stephen Griffin of the University of Leeds believes: "Wearing masks can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces. Touching the face is also a major source of infection when hand hygiene is not in place." In addition, it is recommended that those responsible for caring for suspected infected persons wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="121">The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people only need to wear masks in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for COVID-19 patients, but the organization also recognizes that wearing masks can help avoid touching your face.</seg>
<seg id="122">Some countries and regions have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="123">The CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China clearly recommends that healthy citizens also wear disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact (within 1 meter (3 feet)) with others.</seg>
<seg id="124">Hong Kong, China recommends wearing a mask when taking public transportation or entering crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials advise people to make their own masks and wash them daily.</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly prohibited from entering public places without wearing masks or covering their mouths and noses.</seg>
<seg id="127">On March 16, Vietnam required everyone to wear a mask before entering public places to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian government stipulates that everyone must wear a mask when entering the grocery store.</seg>
<seg id="129">Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.</seg>
<seg id="130">Taiwan, China has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March. From April 1, it has been required to wear masks to take trains and intercity buses.</seg>
<seg id="131">Panama stipulates that it is necessary to wear masks when going out, and it is recommended that residents who cannot buy masks make their own masks.</seg>
<seg id="132">Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Infection prevention and control measures related to maintaining social distances (also known as maintaining physical distances) are aimed at minimizing close contact between people, thereby slowing the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="134">Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension of school work, suspension of work, and closure of stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.</seg>
<seg id="135">In terms of maintaining social distance, measures that individuals can take include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to crowded areas, switching to non-contact greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Now, many governments have mandated or recommended that areas affected by the epidemic maintain social distance.</seg>
<seg id="137">Regarding the size of the largest group of people, US government agencies and health organizations initially recommended 250 people (in areas without COVID-19 transmission), which was quickly reduced to 50 people, and then to 10 people.</seg>
<seg id="138">On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and groups suffering from basic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure, and impaired immune system are at higher risk of serious illness and complications. The German Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that such people living in the epidemic area should not go out as much as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began to replace the term "maintaining social distance" with "maintaining physical distance" to clarify that its purpose is to reduce physical contact while still maintaining social contacts, including virtual contacts and Long distance contact.</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the term "maintain social distance" implies the requirement that people be completely isolated from society, and does not encourage people to use other methods to maintain the connection between people. Some authorities have also issued guidelines on sexual health during the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="140">The recommendations included only having sex with partners who lived together and were not infected with the virus or asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is recommended that COVID-19 diagnosed patients and suspected infected persons be isolated at home.</seg>
<seg id="142">The health agency has issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended that all residents of the epidemic area isolate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">In addition, the strictest self-isolation instructions were issued to high-risk groups.</seg>
<seg id="144">Anyone who has been exposed to COVID-19 patients, or recently traveled to a country or region that has spread widely, will be advised to isolate themselves for 14 days from the time of last exposure to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="145">Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment/suppression and mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="146">Containment applies to the early stages of the outbreak, the purpose is to track and isolate infected persons, while taking other infection prevention and control measures and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of disease to other groups.</seg>
<seg id="147">If it is no longer possible to stop the spread of the disease, it is necessary to make an effort to transition to the mitigation phase: take measures to slow the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of the disease on the health system and society.</seg>
<seg id="148">Containment and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="149">Suppression requires more extreme prevention and control measures to reverse the pandemic situation by reducing the basic regeneration number to less than one. Part of the job of controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is what we know as to flatten the epidemiological curve.</seg>
<seg id="150">This reduces the risk of collapse of the health service system and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatment options.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing masks, and self-isolation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension of school and cancellation of large-scale assembly activities; aiming to encourage acceptance and participation Community actions of such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning. In the face of a significantly increased epidemic situation, China immediately adopted more severe epidemic containment measures, such as the closure of the city and the implementation of strict travel bans.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">South Korea introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures, and issued an alert on the trajectory of the infected person.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provides financial support for self-isolated infected persons and imposes huge fines on those who refuse to isolate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="155">Taiwan, China, has increased the production of masks, and imposed penalties on medical supplies suppliers who cover up and sell. Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States show that both mitigation (slowing but not preventing the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing the spread of epidemics) face major challenges.</seg>
<seg id="156">The best mitigation policy may reduce peak medical demand by 2/3 and halve the number of deaths, but it will still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and cause the health system to collapse.</seg>
<seg id="157">Suppression may be the first measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus stops spreading in the population (or until the vaccine is released, whichever comes first), otherwise once the measures are relaxed, the spread will quickly rebound.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term interventions aimed at curbing pandemics will have social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development work is still ongoing, including trials of existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, fluids, and rest may help relieve symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.</seg>
<seg id="162">The use of steroids may worsen the situation.</seg>
<seg id="163">Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being investigated to determine whether they are suitable for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">The World Health Organization also pointed out that some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">The World Health Organization pointed out that improving the treatment capacity and adjusting the medical system to meet the needs of patients with COVID-19 are basic outbreak response measures.</seg>
<seg id="166">ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating selective procedures where possible, separation and isolation COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improve intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.</seg>
<seg id="167">There is a lot of speculation about the origin of the first case (the so-called patient zero).</seg>
<seg id="168">The first known case of a new coronavirus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019 and is located in Wuhan, Hubei, China.</seg>
<seg id="169">Within a month, cases of new coronavirus in Hubei Province gradually increased.</seg>
<seg id="170">Most of these patients are related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals. One theory is that the new coronavirus originated from one of these animals; or in other words, from zoonotic diseases. On December 26, Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, first discovered and admitted a group of patients with unexplained pneumonia, and reported it to the Jianghan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="171">On December 30, a group of doctors in Wuhan Central Hospital reminded their colleagues to be alert to a "SARS-like coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="172">Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were advised by the police for spreading "rumors", and another doctor, Effen, was advised by his superior for raising the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued an announcement on December 31 and reported it to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="174">After receiving numerous reports of unexplained pneumonia cases, the Wuhan health department initiated an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases roughly doubled every seven and a half days.</seg>
<seg id="175">From the beginning of January to mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China under the influence of the Chinese Spring Festival population movement and Wuhan as a transportation hub and major railway hub.</seg>
<seg id="176">On January 20, China reported nearly 140 newly diagnosed cases in one day, including 2 cases in Beijing and 1 case in Shenzhen.</seg>
<seg id="177">Later official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms. As of March 26, the number of confirmed cases in the United States exceeded China and Italy, becoming the country with the most confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, there have been more than 1.61 million confirmed cases reported worldwide; more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 cured cases.</seg>
<seg id="178">About 200 countries and regions around the world have reported confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="179">Affected by the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have adopted prevention and control measures that restrict the free movement of population and establish border controls.</seg>
<seg id="180">National-level response measures include containment, such as isolation (also known as home orders, asylum orders or blockades) and curfews. As of April 2, there are nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the total population, in some form of blockade, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are blocked, about 59 million people in South Africa, and India 1.3 billion people are blocked.</seg>
<seg id="181">On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of blockade. Two days later this number increased to 2.6 billion, accounting for about one-third of the global population.</seg>
<seg id="182">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report speculates that the earliest case can be traced back to November 17.</seg>
<seg id="183">Dr. Zhang Jixian discovered a batch of unexplained cases of pneumonia on December 26. His hospital reported the situation to the Jianghan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="184">On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronaviruses were found in preliminary genetic testing of patient samples.</seg>
<seg id="185">The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued an announcement on December 31,</seg>
<seg id="186">Reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="187">After these notices were issued, several doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police for the "rumors" of the epidemic of walking.</seg>
<seg id="188">The China National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no âclear evidenceâ from person to person.</seg>
<seg id="189">In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical movement. Later, the CPC Central Committee General Secretary Xi Jinping called it a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="190">On January 23, the government announced that it would pull up an epidemic prevention line in Wuhan, prohibiting people from entering and leaving Wuhan. This epidemic prevention line was later extended to 15 other cities in Hubei. A total of about 57 million people were affected. event".</seg>
<seg id="191">The use of private cars is prohibited in the city.</seg>
<seg id="192">Many places have also canceled the celebration of the Chinese New Year (January 25).</seg>
<seg id="193">The government also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Vulcan Hill Hospital, which was completed and delivered within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="194">Subsequently, another hospital was built, namely the Raytheon Mountain Hospital, to receive more patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has transformed 14 other venues in Wuhan, such as the convention center and stadium, into square cabin hospitals. On January 26, the government took further measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including issuing health declaration forms to travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.</seg>
<seg id="196">Colleges and universities across the country have also been suspended.</seg>
<seg id="197">Hong Kong and Macao in China have also taken a number of measures, especially those aimed at primary and secondary schools and colleges.</seg>
<seg id="198">Many places in China have implemented remote home office measures.</seg>
<seg id="199">In addition to Hubei Province, travel restrictions are imposed on other identities.</seg>
<seg id="200">Public transportation has been adjusted, and museums across China have also been temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="201">Many cities have implemented public activity facilities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) are subject to some form of outdoor activity restrictions. After the March epidemic entered the global stage, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "importing" from other countries and regions.</seg>
<seg id="202">For example, Beijing imposes a 14-day compulsory quarantine on all foreigners entering Beijing. In the five days before March 23, there was only one local case in mainland China, which was transmitted by a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="203">On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of local cases has been basically contained and the Chinese epidemic has been controlled.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the same day, the Hubei region other than Wuhan began to relax its travel restrictions after two months of the blockade. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that from March 28, it will suspend the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits. No details have been disclosed regarding when the policy will end.</seg>
<seg id="205">Those who want to enter China need to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.</seg>
<seg id="206">The Chinese government encourages enterprises and factories to resume work on March 30 and provides a monetary stimulus plan for enterprises. The State Council announced that April 4 will be designated as a national day of mourning, and a three-minute national silence will be launched at 10:00 on that day. This day coincides with the Tomb Sweeping Day. The central government encourages families to mourn their loved ones through the Internet to maintain physical distance and avoid the second outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="207">On January 20, 2020, South Korea had confirmed cases of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="208">The Korean health agency reported that the number of confirmed cases increased significantly on February 20, which was mainly due to a new religious movement rally held in Daegu, South Korea-the Xintiandi Jesus Church.</seg>
<seg id="209">Xintiandi believers from Wuhan to Daegu are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="210">As of February 22, of the 9,336 church members, 1,261, or about 13%, reported symptoms. South Korea announced on February 23, 2020 that it has entered the highest alert level.</seg>
<seg id="211">On February 28, South Korea accumulatively reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.</seg>
<seg id="212">The virus test results of three soldiers were confirmed to be positive, and since then all South Korean military bases have entered isolation.</seg>
<seg id="213">The flight schedule has also been adjusted due to the impact of the epidemic. South Korea has launched a virus prevention and control plan that is considered to be the largest and best organized in the world, that is, to screen a large number of people for viruses, to isolate all infected persons, and to track and isolate close contacts of infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="214">Screening methods include mandatory requirements for new arrivals from abroad to report symptoms on their own through mobile applications, get free of car virus testing, get results the next day, and improve testing capabilities, accommodating up to 20,000 people a day for testing.</seg>
<seg id="215">Although it did not isolate the entire city, South Korea's plan is considered a successful move for epidemic prevention and control. South Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude towards President Moon Jae-inâs crisis response.</seg>
<seg id="216">Many Koreans signed the petition, some called for impeachment and Wen Zaiyin, accusing the government of improper handling of the epidemic, while others praised his response strategy.</seg>
<seg id="217">On March 23, South Korea reportedly had the lowest total number of new cases in a single day since four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="218">On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all newly arrived overseas personnel will be quarantined for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="219">According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus detection assistance from 121 different countries and regions.</seg>
<seg id="220">On February 19, Iran announced that Qom had the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. Later, according to the Iranian Ministry of Health, two patients had died on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="221">Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the suspension of universities, higher education institutions, and primary and secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="222">Iran allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="223">On February 26, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated that he did not plan to block the affected areas, but would only isolate infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="224">In March, Iran announced plans to restrict intercity travel, but intercity traffic congestion continued until the Persian New Year.</seg>
<seg id="225">The Shiite shrine in the Qom region has been open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. In February, Iran became the virus transmission center after China.</seg>
<seg id="226">Many parties believe that the extent of the outbreak in Iran has been covered up. This includes, as of February 28, the retrospective results of cases in more than ten countries point to Iran, which shows that the actual outbreak in Iran is more serious than the 388 cases reported by the government as of that date. .</seg>
<seg id="227">The Iranian parliament was forced to close, and it was reported that 23 of its 290 lawmakers tested positive for the virus on March 3.</seg>
<seg id="228">On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prisons to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peacefully expressing dissent, and temporarily release all eligible prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="229">The organization pointed out that the risk of virus transmission in closed institutions such as detention centers is greater, and these institutions lack adequate medical care measures.</seg>
<seg id="230">On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number of single-day deaths reported by the country since the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="231">As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials died of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="232">As of March 23, there were 50 new confirmed cases per hour in Iran, and one case of death from coronavirus was added every 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="233">According to World Health Organization officials, the actual number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than reported.</seg>
<seg id="234">There are also views that US sanctions on Iran may affect the countryâs financial resources in response to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="235">The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights requested that economic sanctions be eased against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.</seg>
<seg id="236">On January 31, two Chinese tourists were tested positive in Rome by SARS-CoV-2, and the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="237">The number of cases in the country subsequently rose sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="238">Starting from 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on February 21, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was later discovered. On February 22, the cabinet meeting announced a new decree to curb the spread of the epidemic, including the isolation of more than 50,000 people in 11 different cities in northern Italy.</seg>
<seg id="239">Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced: "It is strictly forbidden to enter or leave the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="240">The epidemic area has ordered work stoppages and suspension of sports events.â On March 4, the Italian government ordered all schools across the country to suspend classes altogether because of 100 domestic deaths.</seg>
<seg id="241">All major sports events, including the Italian Football League, will be held in an audienceless mode until April, but on March 9, all sports events have been completely suspended for at least one month.</seg>
<seg id="242">On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian Society of Anesthesia and Analgesic and Critical Medicine (SIAARTI) published medical ethical recommendations on possible triage schemes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On March 19, Italy reported that 3,405 people died from this pandemic, which surpassed China and became the country with the largest number of deaths from new coronaviruses in the world.</seg>
<seg id="244">On March 22, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="245">As of April 5, Italy had a total of 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 cured cases, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.</seg>
<seg id="246">CNN has reported that the dual factors of Italyâs large elderly population and the failure to detect all viral infections so far may be part of the reason for the high mortality rate.</seg>
<seg id="247">The UKâs initial response to the virus is considered to be the most slack among the affected countries. It was not until March 18, 2020 that the British government began to implement various forms of social distance or large-scale isolation measures for its citizens.</seg>
<seg id="248">The British government was therefore criticized and accused of lacking speed and strength in responding to public concerns. On March 16, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that any non-essential travel and social contacts be cancelled, and that people should work at home as much as possible and avoid going to bars, restaurants and theaters.</seg>
<seg id="249">On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments, including bars and gyms, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workersâ wages, with a maximum monthly limit of Â£2,500 to prevent unemployment in the crisis. On March 23, the British Prime Minister announced stricter measures to maintain social distance, prohibiting more than two people from gathering, and no travel or outdoor activities unless absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="250">Unlike previous measures, the restrictions announced this time are enforced by the police through fines and dispersal of assembly.</seg>
<seg id="251">With the exception of businesses that are deemed "essential" such as supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and garages, most other businesses have been ordered to shut down.</seg>
<seg id="252">Washington State in the Pacific Northwest discovered the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States on January 20. The patient returned from Wuhan on January 15 to the local area.</seg>
<seg id="253">On January 29, the White House established the Coronavirus Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="254">On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed entry restrictions on travelers from China.</seg>
<seg id="255">On January 28, 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control (the main public health agency under the US government) announced that it had developed its own test kit.</seg>
<seg id="256">Despite this, the United States still has a slow start in detection, masking the true situation of the epidemic at the time.</seg>
<seg id="257">The kit produced by the federal government in February was defective, and the federal government did not approve the use of non-governmental kits (from academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for testing eligibility were not determined until early March (after which medical advice is required), All of these factors have led to the obstruction of early detection in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="258">On February 27, the Washington Post reported that the total number of tests performed in the United States was less than 4,000.</seg>
<seg id="259">On March 13, the Atlantic reported that the total number of tests performed by the United States was less than 14,000.</seg>
<seg id="260">On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many patients with symptoms and medical orders waited for hours or days before being tested." On February 29, after Washington State reported the first death case in the United States, Governor Jay Insley immediately declared a state of emergency, and other states soon followed up.</seg>
<seg id="261">On March 3rd, schools in the Seattle area were closed. In mid-March, schools at all levels across the country were suspended. On March 6, 2020, some epidemiologists at Imperial College London gave recommendations on the impact of new coronaviruses on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Prevention and Response Supplementary Appropriation Act, which provided US$8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="263">Enterprises impose travel restrictions on employees, cancel meetings, and encourage employees to work from home.</seg>
<seg id="264">Sports events and seasons were forced to be cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced that he would implement a 30-day travel ban on most European countries except the UK from March 13.</seg>

<seg id="424">Most major sporting events are forced to be cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, 2020 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 NBA season, and 2019-20 All-American Hockey Federation season.</seg>
<seg id="425">The outbreak disrupted the plan for the 2020 Summer Olympics that was originally scheduled for the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will be "rearranged beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed, and live poker games have been forced to be postponed or cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="426">This in turn has led many gambling players to turn to online gambling, and several online gambling websites report that their new registration rate has increased significantly. The entertainment industry has also been affected, and various music groups have suspended or cancelled their tour concerts.</seg>
<seg id="427">Many large theaters, such as the Broadway Theater, have also suspended all performances.</seg>
<seg id="428">Some artists also try to continue to create and share works through the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as live concerts, or create online "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works.</seg>
<seg id="429">On the Internet, many Internet fans with the theme of new coronavirus spread. With the spread of uncertainty, many people have begun to turn to humor and divert attention.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudice, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asians and people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries have increased.</seg>
<seg id="431">Many countries and regions, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific, have experienced incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred.</seg>
<seg id="432">Many reports in February this year (most of the cases were still limited to China at the time) documented the racist sentiments shown by different groups around the world to the Chinese, arguing that the Chinese should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate revenge.</seg>
<seg id="433">Anti-China sentiment has also risen in some African countries.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to reports, many residents in Wuhan and Hubei were subjected to regional discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="435">Both offline and online, there are voices to support the Chinese and residents in areas with severe epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="436">As the epidemic spread to other hot countries, Italy became the first country in Europe with a serious outbreak of COVID-19, and people from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and other countries initially signed a petition requesting that Chinese people be prohibited from entering their country in an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="437">In Japan, the topic #ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese people donât come to Japan) was widely spread on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="438">Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing racial abuse and attacks.</seg>
<seg id="439">US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the new coronavirus "Chinese virus". Critics believe that his speech has racial discrimination and anti-China tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="440">Ukrainian protesters attacked the bus from Wuhan to New Sanzali, which contained Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.</seg>
<seg id="441">According to reports, students from northeastern India (bordering China) and studying in major Indian cities have also been harassed by the outbreak of a new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="442">Dilip Gosh, chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature, "So God wants to avenge them."</seg>
<seg id="443">These remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling them "errors". In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination suffered by non-Chinese residents have also been exacerbated by the pandemic. Foreigners are described as "foreign garbage" and should be the target of "garbage disposal".</seg>
<seg id="444">Many newspapers with pay walls have lifted the pay wall restrictions for some or all of the reports of new coronaviruses.</seg>

<seg id="1">COVID-19 Workplace Prevention and Control</seg>
<seg id="2">COVID-19 workplace prevention and control refers to the use of occupational safety and health measures to prevent and control coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">The proper prevention and control of workplace hazards depends on the specific work site and task, and should be determined based on the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of susceptible individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues. Therefore, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to isolate at home after illness, Obey the breathing etiquette and clean and disinfect the working environment daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moderate exposure risk work includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected due to continued community transmission or international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This includes staff who are in contact with the general public, such as schools, high-density work environments, and some large-scale retail environments.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should also use high-efficiency air filters and sneezing protection devices for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment and take other risk prevention and control measures when contacting COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA believes that medical staff and mortuary staff who are in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients are at high risk of exposure. After processing the specimen, the risk of exposure becomes extremely high.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hazard prevention and control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their tasks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The COVID-19 outbreak may have a serious impact on the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Staff may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others, or fear of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="12">Business models may also change, including changes in demand for commodities or changes in access to these commodities (such as shopping during off-peak hours, or using delivery or drop-off delivery services).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, product logistics from the COVID-19 epidemic-stricken area may be interrupted. Infectious disease prevention and response plans can be used to guide protection actions.</seg>
<seg id="14">These plans address the level of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors from the home and community environment, and risk factors for individual workers, such as the elderly or groups with chronic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="15">These plans also outline the prevention and control measures needed to respond to these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise due to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to follow national or local recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goals of responding to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the response measures will also be affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the company is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hazard prevention and control level is a widely used prevention and control framework in occupational safety and health. It is used to group hazard prevention and control measures according to their effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the harm of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering control refers to isolating employees from work-related hazards, rather than relying on employee behavior for control, which is also the lowest cost solution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative control refers to changes to work policies or procedures that require workers or employers to take action on their own.</seg>
<seg id="23">The protective effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) is lower than that of engineering control and administrative control, but it helps prevent some exposures.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of PPE must be selected according to the level of danger faced by the staff, equipped according to the applicable situation (such as a respirator), and must be worn correctly at all times, regularly checked and maintained, replaced if necessary, and properly detached, cleaned, Store or handle to avoid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, low-risk exposure work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is recommended to take basic infection prevention measures in all workplaces, including washing hands frequently. Isolate sick employees at home, observe breathing etiquette when coughing or sneezing, provide paper towels and garbage bins, prepare for remote work, and peak when necessary Commuting to work, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and keeping the workplace clean and disinfected daily.</seg>
<seg id="27">The timely identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is the key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.</seg>
<seg id="28">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who exhibit acute respiratory symptoms should be quarantined at home for at least 24 hours until they are determined to be free of fever, fever signs, and any other symptoms. The sick leave policy should be flexibly implemented to allow employees to care for patients at home Family members of the disease and should clearly inform employees of this policy.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to OSHA regulations, moderate exposure risk work includes the need for frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 meters), but may result in individuals due to continued community transmission near the workplace or due to recent Infected SARS-CoV-2 through the COVID-19 epidemic area.</seg>
<seg id="30">This type of staff includes those who work in schools, high-density working environments and some large-scale retail environments that will contact the general public. The engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, improving ventilation effects, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing protection devices, and installing drop-off windows to provide customer service. Administrative control of this group and high-risk groups includes encouraging sick employees to stay in isolation at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing shift shifts, eliminating unnecessary travel to the COVID-19 outbreak site, and developing emergency communications plans, including A forum to answer staff questions, provide staff with the latest education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behavior, and provide training on the use of protective clothing and protective equipment to staff who need to use protective clothing and protective equipment. Helps improve the resources and working environment of personal hygiene, requires frequent hand washing, restricts customers and the public from entering the work site, and posts signs on hand washing and other COVID-19 protective measures. Depending on the specific task, at least staff with moderate exposure risk should be equipped with personal protective equipment, including gloves, robes, masks or goggles.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such workers are best equipped with respirator.</seg>
<seg id="32">If someone is sick on the plane, proper protective measures should be taken to protect the staff and other passengers, including arranging the patient to a distance of 6 feet from the other passengers, designating a crew member to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask, or requesting the patient Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</seg>
<seg id="33">Crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick travelers, touching body fluids, or potentially contaminating surfaces. If the sick traveler has symptoms such as fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, the crew should also wear additional personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="34">Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazard bags, and then contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk prevention and control measures also include postponing travel when sick. If fever or other symptoms appear on the ship, you should isolate yourself and immediately notify the ship's medical room.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, medical follow-up should be conducted in the compartment of the quarantined person. For schools and child care sites, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if an infected person has been present in the school, regardless of the spread of the community, the corresponding schools and child care sites should be closed for a short period of time to thoroughly clean or disinfect.</seg>
<seg id="36">For low- and medium-level community communications, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling field trips, gatherings and physical education classes, choirs, or cafeteria dining, and other large gatherings, increasing the distance between desks, and arriving and leaving peaks , Restrict non-essential visitors from visiting, and arrange separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="37">If the community spreads seriously, in addition to implementing the social distance strategy, you can also consider extending the suspension time. For law enforcement personnel who perform daily routine activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believes that the direct health risks they face are low.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who must be in contact with COVID-19 diagnosed patients or suspected individuals should act at the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">If close contact occurs during the arrest, staff should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment before using household cleaning sprays or rags for cleaning and use, and should follow standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures and Clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA believes that certain health care and mortuary workers face high or very high exposure risks.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-exposure workers include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation workers who actually contact people with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="42">If staff perform droplet generation procedures on patients with known or suspected COVID-19, or collect or process specimens from infected or suspected infected persons, the risk of exposure becomes extremely high.</seg>
<seg id="43">Droplet generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or collection of body cavity specimens.</seg>
<seg id="44">High-risk exposure mortuary staff include those involved in arranging the bodies of the deceased who were diagnosed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during their lifetime; if an autopsy is performed, the risk of exposure is higher. Additional engineering measures to be taken against this risk group also include isolation rooms for COVID-19 confirmed or suspected cases, including when performing droplet generation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Some healthcare facilities and morgues can also be equipped with a special negative pressure ventilation system.</seg>
<seg id="46">Biosafety level 3 precautions should be taken when handling specimens.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that patients be assigned different waiting areas based on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that personnel working within 6 feet of patients who are known or suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection and those performing droplet generation procedures wear respirator.</seg>
<seg id="48">The United States requires that NIOSH approved N95 filter masks or better masks must be used in the context of comprehensive written respiratory protection programs such as health testing, training, and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">WHO recommends that screening personnel at entry points only need to wear medical surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="51">For staff who need to collect respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without performing droplet generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">If the droplet generation procedure is to be performed, the medical surgical mask must be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 mask.</seg>
<seg id="53">In view of the insufficient supply of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends that through physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, only direct caregivers be allowed to enter the COVID-19 patient's room, only when it is really necessary to use personal protective equipment for certain tasks, and in many nursing Patients with the same diagnosis continue to use the same respirator, monitor and coordinate the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and discourage asymptomatic people from using masks to reduce the demand for personal protective equipment.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incubation period from contact with the patient to onset ranges from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the symptoms are mild in most cases, some cases develop viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of April 17, 2020, the total number of reported cases in 210 countries and regions exceeded 2.24 million, and the number of deaths exceeded 153,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people are currently recovering from treatment. The virus spreads from person to person through close contact, often spread by droplets generated when coughing, sneezing, or talking.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the breath will produce droplets, the droplets usually fall on the ground or the surface of various objects, and will not cause long-distance infection.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, if someone touches the surface contaminated by the virus, and then touch their eyes, nose, mouth and mouth, they may also be infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virus can survive on the surface of the object for up to 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although it may also spread before and after the onset of illness, it is most contagious three days before the onset. The standard diagnostic method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection of nasopharyngeal swabs.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is recommended that people suspected of having a virus infection and their caregivers wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recommendations on wearing masks by the public vary from place to place. Some authorities oppose wearing masks, while others require masks.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine or specific antiviral treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="15">Most countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic, or may have symptoms of suspected flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="17">Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, confusion, difficulty in sobering, and blueness of the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.</seg>
<seg id="18">A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were also monitored.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some Chinese cases showed symptoms of chest tightness and palpitations at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some cases may develop viral pneumonia, multiple organ failure, or even death.</seg>
<seg id="22">We call this the incubation period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">97.5% of infected people will have symptoms within 11.5 days after infection. The report pointed out that not all infected people will have symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of asymptomatic infected persons in the spread of the epidemic has not been fully clarified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that asymptomatic infected persons may promote disease transmission.</seg>
<seg id="26">The proportion of asymptomatic infections has not yet been determined, and research is still intensified. The Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of the confirmed cases did not show any symptoms during hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="27">The National Health Commission of China has included asymptomatic cases in daily notifications since April 1. Of the 166 infected persons on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when tested.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both sputum and saliva can carry large amounts of virus.</seg>
<seg id="29">Speaking loudly sprays more droplets than normal speech.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore found that an unobstructed cough may cause droplets to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">Although such viruses are generally not transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences determined that they may be transmitted by biological aerosols, and the air collector in the corridor outside the ward detected positive samples of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can nebulize respiratory secretions, which can cause airborne transmission.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but this risk is considered low. When a patient develops symptoms, the virus is most contagious; although it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.</seg>
<seg id="34">The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet fully clear, generally 1 person can infect 2-3 people. The survival time of the virus on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specifically, it is known that the new coronavirus can survive on cardboard for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% pure copper products for up to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">If used correctly, soaps and detergents can also kill viruses. Soap products can degrade the fat protection layer of the virus, making it inactive, while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China showed that saliva samples were collected on average two days after admission.</seg>
<seg id="39">5/6 patients had the highest viral load in the first sample, and 1/6 patients had the highest viral load detected the next day.</seg>
<seg id="40">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.</seg>
<seg id="42">Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with household soap, because soap can damage the virus's protective capsule. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant type 2 alveolar cell in the lung.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus binds to ACE2 through a special surface glycoprotein called "spike" (capsule particles) and enters the host cell.</seg>
<seg id="45">Among the patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, 12% of infected people found acute myocardial injury, and a higher proportion of severe patients.</seg>
<seg id="46">The systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders are caused by the worsening of the disease, and the incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the heart's ACE2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="47">The ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in the heart and participates in regulating heart function.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is reported that the incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) in COVID-19-infected patients monitored by ICU is relatively high and may be related to a poor prognosis. COVID-19 fatal patient autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in the lung.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism on airway epithelial cells expressing ACE2, COVID-19 severe patients will experience systemic excessive inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, the pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells in COVID-19 patients are associated with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6 secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology.</seg>
<seg id="51">The autopsy report also showed lymphocyte infiltration.</seg>
<seg id="52">WHO has announced several disease detection programs.</seg>
<seg id="53">The standard detection method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="54">This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">Under normal circumstances, the results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">A blood test can also be performed, but it requires two weeks between the two blood samples, and the results have little immediate value.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish gene sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection reagents to detect whether they are infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can not only detect active infections, but also whether individuals have been infected with viruses in the past) is still under development, but has not yet been promoted.</seg>
<seg id="59">According to Chinese experience, the detection accuracy is only 60% to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">On March 21, 2020, the US FDA approved the first immediate diagnostic reagent and put it into use at the end of the month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by the Central South Hospital of Wuhan University propose a method for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.</seg>
<seg id="61">Early infections are more common in multiple lungs with multiple leaf ground glass shadows, with peripheral asymmetry and posterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="62">As the virus develops, subpleural dominance, lithotripsy signs (thickened leaflet septa with varying degrees of alveolar filling), and pulmonary consolidation may occur.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is very little information about the microscopic pathological damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main pathological findings of the autopsy are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="65">Visual inspection: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary edema</seg>
<seg id="66">Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:</seg>
<seg id="67">Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, lung cell hyperplasia, a large number of atypical lung cells, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and the formation of multinucleated giant cells</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">Pneumonia in convalescence: mechanization of alveolar exudate and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); young white-young red blood cell reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">To reduce the chance of infection, preventive measures that can be taken include: staying at home; avoid entering crowded areas; frequently wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintain good respiratory hygiene; avoid touching eyes without washing hands, Nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="73">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends covering your mouth and nose with tissues when you cough or sneeze; if you do not have tissues, it is recommended to use the inside of your elbow to cover it.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is recommended to clean hand hygiene properly after coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="75">CDC recommends wearing cloth masks in public places to prevent asymptomatic patients from spreading the virus to some extent. The core of the strategy to maintain social distance lies in closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and eliminating large public gatherings, thereby reducing the chances of infected people coming into contact with large groups.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, the social distance criterion requires a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 meters) in interpersonal communication.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are no effective drugs to prevent COVID-19. Given that it is expected that the vaccine will not be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are the key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, which is what we know as "flattening the epidemiological curve."</seg>
<seg id="78">At the same time, the CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when there is obvious dirt on their hands, before meals, and after blowing their noses, coughing, or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">In addition, it is recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% to wash hands, but only when there is no soap and running water around. For regions where water-free hand sanitizers cannot be purchased, WHO provides two formulas for local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity with ethanol or isopropanol.</seg>
<seg id="81">Use hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a "hand disinfection active substance".</seg>
<seg id="82">Add glycerin as a humectant.</seg>
<seg id="83">Provide supportive care for people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and other important organ support.</seg>
<seg id="84">CDC recommends that suspected virus carriers wear simple masks.</seg>
<seg id="85">Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to relieve the symptoms of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still to be studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is recommended to maintain personal hygiene and promote a healthy lifestyle and eating habits to improve immunity.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supporting therapy may be effective for mild patients with early infection. WHO and China National Health Commission issued an initiative calling for proper care of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="88">American critical illness experts and lung specialists have compiled the treatment recommendations put forward by various institutions into a book and provided them free of charge through IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, COVID-19 special treatment has not yet been developed.</seg>
<seg id="90">For some symptoms, some medical experts recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line treatment.</seg>
<seg id="91">Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, and operations that may generate aerosols in a medical environment, such as intubation or ventilation by hand, should pay special attention to protection.</seg>
<seg id="92">For healthcare workers who care for COVID-19 patients, CDC recommends that in addition to standard precautions, exposure precautions, and airborne precautions, patients should be transferred to an airborne infectious disease isolation room (AIIR). The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If possible, it is best to use a respirator (not a mask).</seg>
<seg id="94">N95 masks are approved for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of such masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">It is mainly used to prevent the inhalation of suspended particles (such as dust), but when used for other purposes, it cannot guarantee the effective isolation of specific biological agents.</seg>
<seg id="96">If you donât have a mask, CDC recommends using a face mask. You can also wear a self-made mask if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="97">Most COVID-19 cases are mild and do not require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.</seg>
<seg id="98">Medical staff are actively carrying out research, hoping to provide respiratory support for COVID-19 patients who have symptoms of respiratory failure. There is evidence that high-flow nasal oxygen therapy or biphasic positive airway pressure can avoid intubation.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is not clear whether the above two treatment schemes can produce the same effect on severe patients.</seg>
<seg id="100">If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use invasive mechanical ventilation, because this technique can also limit the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to nasal high-flow oxygen therapy. Severe cases are mainly in the elderly (over 60 years old, especially over 80 years old).</seg>
<seg id="101">In many developed countries, the number of beds per capita is insufficient. In view of the limited medical conditions, the medical system cannot cope with the severe situation that requires hospitalization due to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">A study in China found that 5% of patients need to be sent to the intensive care unit, 2.3% of patients need mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% of patients will be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="103">About 30% of COVID-19 admitted patients in China are eventually sent to the ICU.</seg>
<seg id="104">With the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation is further increased, and the difficulty of oxygenation is becoming more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="105">At that time, a ventilator that supports the pressure control mode and high PEEP needs to be used to maximize the delivery of oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by the ventilator.</seg>
<seg id="106">Older ventilators may not achieve high PEEP.</seg>
<seg id="107">Since January 2020, research on potential therapies has begun, and several antiviral drugs have entered clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="108">Redoxir seems to be the most promising drug at present.</seg>
<seg id="109">Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or have entered advanced testing.</seg>
<seg id="110">Severe patients can try antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="111">WHO urges the majority of volunteers to participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential therapies. The FDA has temporarily authorized the recovery phase of plasma transfusion as an experimental treatment to treat life-threatening critically ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="112">At present, the necessary clinical research has not been carried out to prove whether the therapy can safely and effectively treat this disease.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="114">The user needs to enter the name and ID number as required.</seg>
<seg id="115">This application can detect "close contact" through monitoring data to determine the potential risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of three other users.</seg>
<seg id="117">Once a potential risk is detected, the application will not only recommend self-quarantine, but also alert local health officials. Comprehensive use of mobile phone data big data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government approved security agencies to track cell phone data of suspected coronavirus carriers.</seg>
<seg id="119">The purpose of this measure is to enforce quarantine and protect groups that may come into contact with infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom and the German Federal Government Agency Robert Koch Institute shared aggregated mobile phone location data in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="121">Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect people who violate the isolation regulations.</seg>
<seg id="122">Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera pointed out that mobile phone operator data shows that â40% of citizens are still walking aroundâ.</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for creative solutions worldwide to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">Isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or worry about infections can all be confusing.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor's point of view, "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are the perfect storms that hurt people's mental health and well-being."</seg>
<seg id="127">This disease is mild, with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="128">Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.</seg>
<seg id="129">According to data from other similar viruses (such as SARS and MERS), pregnant women have a higher risk of developing COVID-19 severe patients, but COVID-19 data support is lacking. COVID-19 may affect the lungs of some people, which may lead to pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="130">In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">COVID-19 related complications include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.</seg>
<seg id="132">6% of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital had coagulation abnormalities, especially prothrombin time extension, and 4% of patients in this group had abnormal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="133">About 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have elevated liver enzymes (transaminase).</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time from onset to death is ten days, of which the average length of hospital stay is five days.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the average time from admission to death for patients transferred to the ICU is seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">Early case studies have found that the average time from early symptoms to death is 14 days, and the overall time range is 6 to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">A study by the China National Health Commission (NHC) found that the male mortality rate was 2.8% and the female mortality rate was 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="138">Histopathological examination of the autopsy lung samples showed that both lungs showed diffuse alveolar injury with cell-fiber mucus-like secretions.</seg>
<seg id="139">Viral cytopathies were observed in lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="140">Lung imaging is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">Of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, 11.8% caused cardiac injury due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of admitted patients have a previous medical history. Medical resource supply and regional socioeconomic conditions may also affect mortality.</seg>
<seg id="143">Given the regional differences and the difficulty of the method, the estimates of disease mortality are different.</seg>
<seg id="144">Underestimating mild cases can lead to overestimating mortality.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, if the death was due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">Compared with non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop COVID-19 in critically ill patients, requiring intensive care or lethal about 2.4 times. People are concerned about the long-term sequelae of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="147">The Hong Kong Hospital Authority of China found that the lung capacity of some of the recovered patients decreased by 20% to 30%, and lung scans showed organ damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">In addition, you may face post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it is unclear whether previous infections will enable the rehabilitated person to obtain effective long-term immunity.</seg>
<seg id="150">According to the behavioral characteristics of other coronaviruses, it is believed that immunity may be produced, but it has been reported that some COVID-19 cases were tested positive for coronavirus shortly after recovery.</seg>
<seg id="151">It is believed that these cases are persistent infection worsening rather than reinfection.</seg>
<seg id="152">This virus is considered a natural virus, originated in animals, and is infected through overflow.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, almost all of the infection range is interpersonal transmission.</seg>
<seg id="154">The first batch of 41 confirmed COVID-19 case studies published in The Lancet in January 2020 showed that the earliest onset date was December 1, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="155">The earliest onset date reported in WHO official publications is December 8, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="157">These numbers vary from region to region and will change over time, and are affected by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time of the first outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health status.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths, and U07.2 to clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 infection but without laboratory Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths. The case fatality rate is equal to the total number of deaths in a given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global case fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).</seg>
<seg id="160">The case fatality rate is different in different regions. Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR). The former reflects the percentage of deaths from disease to the number of diagnoses, and the latter reflects the deaths from disease to the number of infections (including confirmed and undiagnosed) Number of people).</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process from infection to case resolution for a specific population.</seg>
<seg id="162">Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infected people.</seg>
<seg id="163">The Italian epidemic centre Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with a population of only 4,600. Currently 80 people (1.7%) have died from the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="164">In Gangelt, the outbreak spread through various carnivals and even affected young people, but the mortality rate was relatively low, and not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified.</seg>
<seg id="165">In addition, the German medical system is already overwhelmed.</seg>
<seg id="166">Evaluation of blood donors shows that about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="167">So far, it has been confirmed that 69 people (accounting for 0.004% of the total population) have died from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the epidemic and mortality vary by gender.</seg>
<seg id="169">Studies in China and Italy show that the mortality rate of men is higher than that of women.</seg>
<seg id="170">Men aged 50-60 years are at the highest risk of death, with only a 90-year-old gender gap being similar.</seg>
<seg id="171">The mortality rate of males in China is 2.8%, and the mortality rate of females is 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact cause of this gender difference is not clear, but it may be caused by genetic and behavioral factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Based on gender-based immunological differences, females have a lower smoking rate, and males have comorbidities (such as hypertension) at a younger age than females, resulting in higher male mortality than females.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57% of men are infected, and men account for 72% of the total deaths due to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked gender-related data on COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="176">Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.</seg>
<seg id="177">The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher, and the risk of exposure to the virus is also higher.</seg>
<seg id="178">On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease will be officially named "COVID-19".</seg>
<seg id="179">WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained this: CO stands for "coronal", VI stands for "virus", D stands for "disease", and 19 stands for the time of the first outbreak (December 31, 2019).</seg>
<seg id="180">The name was chosen to avoid referencing specific geographic locations (for example, China), animal species or people, in order to comply with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In addition, WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "viruses that cause COVID-19" in mass communication.</seg>
<seg id="182">Diseases and viruses are commonly known as "coronaviruses".</seg>
<seg id="183">During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, people commonly referred to viruses and diseases as "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, the WHO recommended the use of 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary virus and disease names based on 2015 guidelines on the location of disease and virus names.</seg>
<seg id="185">The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 will be released on February 11, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="186">Given the capacity constraints of the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have begun to print health care materials, such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.</seg>
<seg id="187">For example, an Italian hospital urgently needed ventilation valves. The supplier could not deliver the parts within the required time. A local start-up company performed reverse engineering and printed out the 100 ventilation valves required overnight.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease were overwhelming and quickly spread through the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="192">Government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers are actively carrying out international research and developing vaccines and drugs to treat COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Unity Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that are currently most likely to produce therapeutic effects.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is currently no vaccine, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="195">Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through the ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to use the previous work of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three vaccine strategies are being studied.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, the researchers plan to develop a whole virus vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">The use of this type of virus, whether it is an inactive virus or a dead virus, is aimed at stimulating the body's rapid immune response when newly infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy is to develop a subunit vaccine, which aims to develop a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this type of research focused on the S-spike protein of the helper virus invading the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is to develop nucleic acid vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine development technology).</seg>
<seg id="202">The safety and effectiveness of the test vaccines developed by the above strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first vaccine clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine contains harmless gene sequences copied from the virus that caused the disease. It has always been thought that antibody-dependent enhancement may become a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this statement is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="204">As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="205">Seven trials completed assessments and were approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Switching the use of antiviral drugs accounted for the vast majority of Chinaâs research, and nine phase III clinical trials of Radecivir will be conducted in multiple countries by the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidate has begun. Several existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 are currently being evaluated, including redcivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combination interferon beta .</seg>
<seg id="208">As of March 2020, the efficacy of redoxivir has been initially confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="209">Observations have shown that the symptomatic symptoms of patients treated with sympathetic medication redoxivir have eased.</seg>
<seg id="210">Phase III clinical trials are currently underway in the US, China and Italy. In February 2020, China launched chloroquine (used to treat malaria in the past) and achieved preliminary results.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, there are calls for peer review of this research.</seg>
<seg id="212">South Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1 gram per day, while reminding that twice the dose is very dangerous and may even be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="214">On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorizations for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to use the above two drugs to treat patients with COVID-19. Chinaâs seventh edition of the guidelines also proposes the use of interferon, ribavirin, or apidol hydrochloride to treat COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data indicate that high-dose ribavirin has an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="216">After confirming the low concentration of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to use nitazoxanide for further in vivo studies. Studies have shown that the original spike protein triggered by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with the ACE2 receptor into the human body.</seg>
<seg id="217">Regardless of whether it is used in combination with azithromycin, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies have serious limitations. Unless further research is conducted, the medical community cannot accept these therapies. Oseltamivir has no inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has not been found to have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="218">Cytokine storm may become a complication of later treatment for COVID-19 severe patients.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australian stores lowered the maximum amount of toilet paper per transaction</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles nationwide lowered the purchase limit of toilet paper purchases for each of their stores to two packs and one pack, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">ALDI also introduced restrictions on buying one pack on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">These restrictions are posted in the form of messages on the cash register or posted on the chainâs Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is reported that buyers are hoarding goods because of fear of COVID-19 in case they need to isolate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper delivered to the door to a single package.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced restrictions on purchasing 4 packages per transaction on March 4 and 5, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coles reported in its March 8 press release that after implementing the purchase restriction of 4 packs, "many stores are still sold out within an hour of arrival", saying that the demand is "unprecedented." At the same time, ALDI In a Facebook post on Tuesday, he called it "unexpected."</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a Woolworths spokesperson, last week's sales "increased dramatically".</seg>
<seg id="10">Last week, the Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowed quantity to two packs.</seg>
<seg id="11">To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional inventory, and ALDI prepared inventory in advance for planned Wednesday specials.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers tried to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made this difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects that as suppliers try to meet demand, production costs will rise, while preferential activities will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early release of inventory, some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday special events.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a report on News.com.au, retail expert Dr. Gary Mortimer of Queensland University of Technology stated that the store replenishes inventory every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said that toilet paper is a large item, so the amount of inventory is small, and once sold out, it will leave a huge shelf space, exacerbating the feeling of shortage of materials.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The point of view of Coles and Woolworths is that if there are many things on the shelves, goods like roll paper and hand sanitizer are [buyable] and the quantity is sufficient, you may not be so scared." Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.</seg>
<seg id="18">Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Shu Jie toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent toilet paper, both emphasize that they are working around the clock and open on weekends to ensure supply.</seg>
<seg id="20">Real estate website Domain.com reported that because buyers are taking a break on Labor Day long weekends, the number of auctions held is small, so some real estate agents will provide free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="21">NT News is a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, and its Thursday edition of the newspaper contains 8 pages of inserts intended for use as toilet paper after cutting.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to ABC Australia's report on March 3, the store was initially reluctant to implement purchase restrictions. They said they had no plans to implement purchase restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other commodities is also high, including masks, hand sanitizer, dry goods, hand sanitizer and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado restricted the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 2 packs of 12 rolls per pack on Sunday night.</seg>

<seg id="1">From: Katherine Maher, CEO of Wikimedia Foundation</seg>
<seg id="2">To: All Wikimedia Foundation employees</seg>
<seg id="3">Theme: [Covid-19] Packed lightly, ready for the future</seg>
<seg id="4">Delivery date/time: 00:24, March 14, 2020 (Coordinated Universal Time)</seg>
<seg id="5">License: CC0: No rights reserved</seg>
<seg id="6">Since this month, we have encountered some difficult situations.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we clearly felt the fate of all mankind, and also recognized our responsibility to each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are faced with unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best measures to deal with this challenge require people around the world to empathize, cooperate and promote community building, which is the core concept of Wikimedia.</seg>
<seg id="9">All colleagues communicate friendship and care through email, phone and chat, which fully proves the extraordinaryness of our colleagues, how we are fortunate to work with you.</seg>
<seg id="10">I am extremely grateful and proud to be a colleague with you.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, someone expressed appreciation for our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">They made me realize that Wikipedia is available all over the world at this moment, what a meaningful thing it is, and it also made me realize that this key resource keeps functioning and is symbolic to people all over the world. power.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whether your job is responsible for website operations, salary payments, or community security, the normal operation of Wikimedia is inseparable from your hard work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The world today needs information from Wikipedia more than ever.</seg>
<seg id="15">At this stage, our work content and working methods will have an important impact on the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">In view of the importance of this mission and the important tasks shouldered by colleagues, we will make some important adjustments to our collaborative approach starting next week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Work style and schedule adjustment</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss the company's working methods and schedule in the next few days to several months.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the meeting, we considered what we believe to be appropriate responses to the company's current challenges and best practices to ensure the company's sustainability during the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="20">The executive team unanimously agreed to reduce the pressure on the company's employees, so that everyone can support the company's mission for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="21">We support you to reduce work pressure appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all employees, contractors and contract workers:</seg>
<seg id="23">Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), and subsequent changes will be notified later.</seg>
<seg id="24">This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer hours every day, we will arrange tasks for you based on your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, in view of the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as caring for family members, going out for shopping or seeing a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will not track your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are sick, please put down your work.</seg>
<seg id="28">Although this is self-evident, we still want to remind you, please rest assured.</seg>
<seg id="29">You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team modify the work calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you are diagnosed with a positive COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the Talent and Culture Operations Department, which will provide support to you and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from management.)</seg>
<seg id="31">For hourly employees, we will pay in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already expressed and promised again to abide by the promises made to contractors and hourly colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="33">The salary we pay to everyone will continue to be calculated based on the remuneration they receive under normal circumstances for completing normal working hours.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if you are sick or unable to work, it is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are willing to work, we will support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through work to relieve their stress.</seg>
<seg id="37">Our work can bring incredible returns, even more so in the current period.</seg>
<seg id="38">But taking care of yourself is still the number one priority.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to maintain communication with your manager so that we can understand your latest situation and make adjustments accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Prioritize important work.</seg>
<seg id="41">We must maintain the normal operation of some important work.</seg>
<seg id="42">The work performed by the website reliability engineering team, human resources operations team, trust and security team, and fundraising team (and other teams) is critical and may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will begin to assess the current goals with all departments and shift our focus to supporting matters that are critical to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">All of us have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus our work on the most important projects.</seg>
<seg id="45">Temporarily slowing down will not affect future development.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not intend to "work overtime to make progress" after the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="47">We will not ask you to work overtime to catch up with the deadline, because now it seems unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="48">We accept that the current environment has changed, and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="49">What will happen to the APP (annual plan)?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to adapt to the new reality and daily working time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 annual plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">We hope to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time for budgeting, so that employees can prioritize key tasks and take care of themselves and their families; at the same time, for those who need or hope to reduce the workload in the next few weeks Employees adjust work arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="52">Extending the timetable can significantly reduce the current planned workload of the entire organization and reduce work pressure.</seg>
<seg id="53">We will make the above proposal to the board of directors next week. If the proposal is passed, we will update the follow-up work arrangements to all representatives and teams as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thanks to the leadership of the APP team in this process.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office conditions, exposure and cleanliness</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that a colleague in the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, out of caution, we hired some anti-virus cleaners to fully disinfect the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They use hospital-level disinfection solutions to disinfect various surfaces as well as the halls and elevators that lead to our floors.</seg>
<seg id="59">The office building is fulfilling its duty-of-care agreement and using corresponding products to ensure the safety of tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We believe that when everyone decides to return to work, the office is fully prepared to welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our Washington DC office uses the WeWork office. WeWork shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington DC staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office has switched to full-person remote office based on the guidelines we shared with the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="63">At the same time, as some colleagues in the New York office already know, we have been discussing the issue of renting office space in Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">These discussions are continuing, but may be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some colleagues are exposed to teleworking for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="66">Other long-term colleagues who work remotely want to provide these colleagues with some suggestions on adjusting their working methods:</seg>
<seg id="67">The meeting time should be controlled within one to two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If you need more time, please consider distributing the content of the meeting to multiple dates.</seg>
<seg id="69">Clearly determine the meeting objectives, set the meeting agenda, and send reading materials in advance.</seg>
<seg id="70">Use video conferencing as the default meeting method, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom for online collaboration and contact.</seg>
<seg id="71">In each meeting, arrange a moderator to host the meeting, arrange one person to monitor the questions in the chat window and track the changes in the speaker list, and arrange another person to take charge (or use multi-person collaboration) to help take the meeting record.</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need comfortable headphones, please send an email to contact technical support.</seg>
<seg id="73">Use your health allowance to buy snacks.</seg>
<seg id="74">Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues</seg>
<seg id="75">The human resources operation team is studying ergonomic guidance in the form of webinars to help all Foundation colleagues improve their work efficiency during the distributed office.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all community beneficiaries to cancel public activities funded by Wikimedia, such as Editor Pine, before the WHO declared the end of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="77">These requests for cancellation of activities and other restrictions may prevent these community payees from completing the original donation activities. We have informed them that we understand this, and also promise that none of them will delay or modify these goals. And be punished.</seg>
<seg id="78">In the next week, we will continue to provide more guidance at Wikimania and other regional community meetings and themed community meetings.</seg>
<seg id="79">The global community seems to be shrouded in the sadness caused by the destruction of the epidemic, but it also reflects the relief of being able to clearly pay attention to their respective communities, Wikimedia and others.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and track the communication between the community and us.</seg>
<seg id="81">Keep in touch to communicate COVID-19 related issues</seg>
<seg id="82">We plan to hold a special employee meeting at 14:00 (Coordinated Universal Time)/07:00 (Pacific Time) next Thursday, and we will send you an invitation to your calendar later.</seg>
<seg id="83">At the meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and set aside some time for everyone to discuss.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are united and dedicated to help you here.</seg>
<seg id="85">At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and gather all the information in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries currently affected by the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have any questions about travel, activities, main workflow or insurance, or need other help, please feel free to contact and cooperate with the CRT team.</seg>
<seg id="89">We are here to provide you with the support and contact you need.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Head of Global Human Resources Operations.</seg>
<seg id="91">Although we are faced with these changes, we cannot give up our work and obligations.</seg>
<seg id="92">On the contrary, this epidemic made us realize that we may need to adjust our work and obligations in a way that has not been done before.</seg>
<seg id="93">We believe that these measures are necessary to allow us to support each other to continue to complete their work, provide the support we need for our actions, and continue to bring the services they rely on to the world.</seg>
<seg id="94">Plan well at all times so that you are not afraid of challenges.</seg>
<seg id="95">Now, please support each other and create space for important work in the coming weeks and months.</seg>
<seg id="96">We need everyone to contribute to achieving this goal, so please take care of yourself and your family to keep you in top condition when needed.</seg>
<seg id="97">Finally, please remember to wash your hands frequently and don't touch your face.</seg>
<seg id="98">Katherine, CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).</seg>

<seg id="1">It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 "Suspected Cases" and "Confirmed Cases"</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, our team released the "2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection Diagnosis and Treatment Quick Recommendation Guide", through which we provide experience and lessons for the global response to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease. Based on the ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our knowledge of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we responded to an opinion on the above guidelines and provided the latest "suspected cases" and "according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan (seventh edition)" issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. "Diagnosed cases" diagnostic criteria.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) broke out. At present, the disease has been officially named the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The virus was once named severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On March 11, 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation guideline and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since its release, it has attracted widespread attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Based on the ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our knowledge of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the National Health Commission of the Peopleâs Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued a total of 7 editions of the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Program from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020. , Some of which have undergone substantial changes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now, our guidelines have received comments from Zhou et al. They have proposed a simple scoring scheme based on their clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their work provides new evidence for our guidelines and a valuable reference for this global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="13">We recognize and thank them for this important work they have done.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, their proposal also needs to be updated according to the latest "COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Program (Trial Version 7)" and recent research.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the diagnosis of a suspected case requires a combination of one epidemiological history feature and two clinical manifestations for comprehensive analysis. If there is no clear epidemiological history, it needs to meet Three clinical manifestations:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) Have traveled or lived in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities with COVID-19 cases reported within 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (nucleic acid Positive test) history of contact; (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities reporting COVID-19 within 14 days prior to symptom onset; (4) with aggregation Confirmed cases (within 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms, within a small range of exposure â¥ 2 patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school classes, etc.) have a history of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or decreased white blood cell count and decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of onset.</seg>
<seg id="18">The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases, and there is any one of the following etiological or serological evidence: (1) SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR test was positive; (2) viral genome sequencing showed that Known new coronaviruses are highly homologous; (3) The specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were positive in the serum test; or the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody changed from negative to positive, or in The titer rises â¥ 4 times during the recovery period, which is higher than the acute period.</seg>
<seg id="19">We can see that the second edition (January 18, 2020) and the third edition (January 22, 2020) added real-time PCR nucleic acid detection in respiratory or blood specimens.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (February 8, 2020) increased the etiology of blood specimens; the seventh edition later added serological evidence.</seg>
<seg id="21">These modifications are based on the continued work of researchers to study the best nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens including blood collection, which increases the availability of different specimens and incorporates positive results for specific antibodies into the diagnostic criteria Provided evidence.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, more and more evidence reminds us to pay attention to atypical and asymptomatic patients.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk."</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the scoring system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, we hope that more direct evidence will appear and appeal to readers to make comments.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that you refer to and follow the latest guidelines in the country where the cases are located.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team will also update our guide in time to help.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that a continuous outbreak of COVID-19 (a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) is a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, not the risk of specific cases, WHO pointed out that the government needs to be urged to take measures:</seg>
<seg id="4">"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="5">If each country/region tests, tests, treats, isolates, tracks and mobilizes its people as a response," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are deeply concerned about the alarming degree of proliferation and severity and the alarming degree of inaction."</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="8">He commented on CNN in February, "Except for the flu, it has not been found which respiratory virus continues to spread to the world after its emergence."</seg>
<seg id="9">Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."</seg>
<seg id="10">He continued, "Similarly, we have never seen a controllable virus pandemic before."</seg>
<seg id="11">Before entering a new state of pandemic, WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "The most important thing is that it is still getting worse."</seg>
<seg id="13">As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 Respiratory Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus laboratory tests include: detection of the presence of the virus and detection of antibodies after infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">RT-PCR can detect the RNA of the coronavirus and determine the presence of virus in the sample.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is specific for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be used to determine if you have recently been infected or if you have an active infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody testing (serum test) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody testing shows how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with mild symptoms that have not been reported or asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The test results can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of population immunity in the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country can provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.</seg>
<seg id="9">As of March 23, no country/region has more than 3% of the population tested, and the number of tests completed in each country varies greatly.</seg>
<seg id="10">This difference may also seriously affect the reported case fatality rate, which may be severely overestimated in some countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection using a throat swab can only obtain reliable results if it is completed within the first week after infection.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to 2 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">RT-PCR testing with pharyngeal swabs can only achieve reliable results if it is completed within the first week of infection.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, the virus disappeared in the throat, but continued to multiply in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">For infected persons who are tested in the second week after infection, the sample can be replaced with a deep respiratory tract extract obtained through a suction tube, or cough (sputum) can be used.</seg>
<seg id="16">In January 2020, rRT-PCR was released at CharitÃ© Hospital in Berlin, which was one of the early PCR tests and became the basis for the 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">On January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed a test method. On January 28, 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">It looks for the "E" gene common to all beta coronaviruses, as well as the RdRp gene unique to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to obtain the emergency use approval of the China National Drug Administration for the production of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to the Public Health Laboratory through the International Reagent Resources Department.</seg>
<seg id="19">The early version of the test kit used three genetic tests, one of which was unable to determine the result due to reagent defects, and at the same time, the Atlanta CDC had a detection bottleneck; this resulted in an average sample that was successfully processed every day throughout February 2020 The number is less than 100.</seg>
<seg id="20">The two-part testing method was not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, at which time the state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">This test is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. The US Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">LabCorp announced that from March 5, 2020, RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics also announced that it will provide nationwide COVID-19 testing from March 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantity limit has been announced; sample collection and processing must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and produced by the National Virology and Biotechnology Research Center (VECTOR).</seg>
<seg id="26">On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federal Health Supervision Office. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic has developed a kit to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, a test method of Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA. This method can complete a large number of tests in 3.5 hours, so that a device can perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, FDA issued Abbottâs m2000 system for emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories; FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020, Cepheid's test method, which took approximately 45 minutes, was also authorized by the FDA for emergency use.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA has approved a detection method that uses nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since this method does not require a series of temperature change cycles, a positive result can be obtained in only 5 minutes, and a negative result can be determined within 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">There are currently approximately 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a detection method that uses monoclonal antibodies (specifically combined with the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of a new coronavirus), and hopes that it can provide test results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.</seg>
<seg id="32">A review of the literature in March 2020 came to the conclusion, "In the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of chest radiographs is very small, and the performance of CT [Computed Tomography] may be obvious, even before symptoms appear."</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical features of CT include multilobe ground glass shadows of both lungs, with peripheral asymmetry and posterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="34">As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, lithotripsy signs, and lung consolidation will develop.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan (where the current pandemic first broke out) showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less accurate, and many of its imaging features are different from other pneumonia and Diseases overlap.</seg>
<seg id="36">As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a first-line test tool for diagnosing COVID-19." Starting in March 2020, CDC recommends the use of PCR for initial screening.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect the infection of individuals about 7 days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immune status of the monitored population. Measurements can be performed in a central laboratory (CLT) or through point-of-care testing (PoCT).</seg>
<seg id="39">Many high-throughput automated systems in clinical laboratories can perform these measurements, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">For CLT, although a sequence sample can be used to track the immune response, it is usually measured using a peripheral blood sample.</seg>
<seg id="41">For PoCT, skin puncture is usually used to obtain a blood sample.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is no need to perform an extraction step before the measurement, which is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, FDA approved the test methods declared by 29 entities, and these entities are now able to distribute their antibody test kits.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7, 2020, FDA approved only one test based on the emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the test kits of Ormon Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved in Europe. These kits can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="44">The detection capability is that hundreds of samples can be detected in a few hours, so the determination of viral RNA is much faster than traditional PCR determination.</seg>
<seg id="45">In general, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the start of infection. In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hong Kong has established a mechanism for suspected patients to be able to stay at home. "The emergency room provides patients with sample test tubes." The patient spit saliva into the test tubes, and then sent the test tubes back. The results will be received later. The British NHS announced that it is piloting a plan to detect suspected cases at home, which will eliminate the risk of patients infecting other people when they go to the hospital, and also eliminate the risk that patients must disinfect the ambulance after using it. When conducting a COVID-19 suspected case-free test, healthcare professionals can take appropriate precautions to take samples.</seg>
<seg id="47">The car-free testing center has helped South Korea to conduct faster and more extensive testing than other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that non-institutions have the capacity to perform approximately 12,000 tests per day, compared with 10,700 tests last week.</seg>
<seg id="48">If the test is performed at the request of a doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">The director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany stated that Germany's total weekly inspection capacity is 160,000 copies.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of March 19, it has provided drop-off testing in many large cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As of March 26, 2020, the total number of people tested in Germany is not known, because only the number of people who tested positive was reported.</seg>
<seg id="52">An initial laboratory survey showed that as of the 12th week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples (including the 12th week of 2020) were tested, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 . In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for simultaneously testing samples from 64 patients, that is, aggregating samples, and only conducting further tests if the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, BGI temporarily established a 2,000-square-meter emergency testing laboratory called "Fire Eye", which was put into use on February 5, 2020, and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.</seg>
<seg id="53">The laboratory was built within 5 days under the supervision of Wang Jian, founder of BGI, and the modeling showed that if the above detection capabilities were not achieved, the cases in Hubei would be 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment isolation costs would also double.</seg>
<seg id="54">After the Wuhan laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately established the Huoyan laboratory, which is currently established in 12 cities in China.</seg>
<seg id="55">As of March 4, 2020, the total daily throughput of laboratory testing will be 50,000 copies per day. Origami Assays released an open source, multi-channel design that can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 with only 93 measurements. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for automatic pipettes.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of March, reagent shortages and shortages have become obstacles to large-scale testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="57">This has led some promoters to explore sample preparation protocols, which involve heating the sample to 98 Â°C (208 Â°F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on March 31 that it has now conducted a new coronavirus test on more of its population, testing more people than any other country, and is expanding the level of testing to allow a large number of people to be tested.</seg>
<seg id="58">The way to achieve this testing capability is to use drive-through testing on the one hand, and to fund Group 42 and BGI (based on its âFire Eyeâ emergency testing laboratory in China) to establish a response High-throughput laboratories for large-scale population testing needs.</seg>
<seg id="59">The laboratory was built in 14 days and can perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day. It is the world's first laboratory of this scale operating outside of China.</seg>
<seg id="60">China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different detection methods for various parts of the coronavirus gene map.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test kits, sending kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German method was announced on January 17, 2020; the plan developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be available until January 28, thereby limiting the USâs testing capabilities. Both China and the United States encountered reliability problems of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak. These two countries and Australia could not provide enough test kits to meet the needs and test recommendations made by health experts.</seg>
<seg id="63">Contrary to this, experts believe that extensive testing in South Korea is helpful in reducing the spread of new coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thanks to the testing capabilities established by the Korean government in the past few years, it is mainly concentrated in private sector laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization called for additional testing programs as the best way to slow down the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to a very high demand for testing, which has resulted in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private US laboratories, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents has become tight.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the United States, the test kits developed by CDC have "defects"; subsequently, the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test box from the Chinese company Shenzhen Yirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and found that the test results were inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The company explained that inaccurate test results may be caused by incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of test kits.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish Cabinet stated that it would recover the kit that returned the wrong result and replace it with another kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China have incorrect test results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China and found it to be inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister MatoviÄ suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. AteÅ Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test boxes purchased by Turkey from China had a âhigh error rateâ and did not âput them into useâ. The UK purchased 3.5 million test cartridges from China and announced in April 2020 that these test cartridges were unusable.</seg>
<seg id="71">Testing and quarantining those who test positive and tracing the contact history of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons can achieve positive results.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of VÃ² (the place where the first COVID-19 patient died) conducted two rounds of testing for a population of approximately 3,400 people, with each round separated by about ten days.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of them were tested positive and asymptomatic, and all found cases were isolated.</seg>
<seg id="74">By adopting travel restrictions on the community, new infections are completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on inbound travel, detection and quarantine, the rate of coronavirus transmission in Singapore in 2020 is much slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not adopted extreme restrictions, such as mandatory closure of restaurants and retail establishments .</seg>
<seg id="76">Many activities have been cancelled in Singapore. Residents were advised to stay at home starting on March 28, but the school resumed classes on time on March 23 after the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries, including Ireland and South Korea, have also managed to control the large-scale epidemic of the disease through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on inbound travel, detection and isolation, and less aggressive blockade measures.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that countries with more tests have lower case mortality rates than the number of deaths. The reason may be that these countries can better detect groups with only mild or asymptomatic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">WHO recommends that countries with no testing capabilities and limited national laboratory experience in handling COVID-19 send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to 16 WHO reference laboratories One of them is checked for confirmation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 are located in Europe, 2 are located in Africa, 1 is located in North America, and 1 is located in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the following chart, the "% positive test" column is affected by the country's testing policy.</seg>
<seg id="82">Under the same conditions, compared with countries where all citizens are tested (whether or not showing symptoms), countries with only inpatients have a higher positive detection rate.</seg>

<seg id="1">From January 1 to March 15, 2020, the cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK has increased rapidly</seg>
<seg id="2">The cumulative incidence of new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in various countries in the EU/EEA and the UK, confirming that although different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly development of.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the Italian experience, the country, hospitals and intensive care units all need to be more fully prepared to meet the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 patients, and intensive care tasks are particularly important.</seg>
<seg id="4">On December 31, 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China reported multiple cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology.</seg>
<seg id="5">On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the pathogen was a new coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">Thereafter, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence to date indicates that approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, ie respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most can recover.</seg>
<seg id="8">In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 will progress to critical illness and require hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases will progress to critical illness and require intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mortality rate of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is about 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this study, we evaluated the trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in various countries of the European Union/EU/European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compared them with Hubei, China Provinces are compared.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK between January 31 and March 15, 2020 with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK</seg>
<seg id="13">After China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has been further expanded. At present, the dynamic changes of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to China.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the "European Surveillance" magazine published on March 5, 2020, Spitteri et al. reported the first batch of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe based on the WHO case definition.</seg>
<seg id="16">In EU/EEA, France reported the earliest three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020. The patients were returned from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have detected COVID-19 cases. From December 31 to March 15, 2019, including that day, 39,768 cases and 1,727 have been reported There were 17,750 deaths and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Obtain the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases</seg>
<seg id="19">The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of reported COVID-19 cases in every country around the world at 8:00 am every day. They are only obtained from official sources, such as the ministries of health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data have been used to assess EU/EEA and UK COVID-19 trends and compare them with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">We calculated the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom from January 1 to March 15, 2020, as an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, In order to consider the natural course of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="22">We also provide the total number of reported cases in each country as of 8:00 AM on March 15, 2020, and compare it with data from Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK</seg>
<seg id="24">The 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">For EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21, 2020, and then increased sharply around February 28 (Supplementary Material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is mainly due to the rapidly increasing number of cases reported in Italy, but the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom also shows a similar growth trend (supplementary material).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom from January 31 to March 15, 2020, compared with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="28">It should be emphasized that as of 8:00 AM on March 15th, the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy in less than 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the UK is rapidly increasing.</seg>
<seg id="30">The observed cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 indicates that the outbreak is developing at a similar rate in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">Although each country is at a different stage, the national public health response measures are different, the definition of cases may be different in each country, and the options for selecting patients who must undergo COVID-19 definitive diagnosis testing-including additional testing-are different, but The situation is the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">In early March 2020, according to doctors in affected areas in Italy, approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients require intensive care, and media reports indicate that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have reached their maximum capacity.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the EU/EEA level, the currently available data are only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases hospitalized and/or admitted to the intensive care unit (data not shown).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner to supplement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of intensive care and mid-term care beds available in European countries varies greatly. The number of beds per 100,000 people ranges from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (2010-2011 has 12.5 intensive care and mid-term care beds for every 100,000 people).</seg>
<seg id="37">The sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 by ECDC modeled scenarios related to the saturation of health care capabilities, and the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom and exceeded the intensive care bed The relationship between the amount of risk&amp;gt; 90% was estimated.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since the cases have so far been concentrated in EU/EEA countries and certain areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually provide services for the population covered by the defined areas, it is best to be at the level of "standard statistical geographic unit 2" (NUTS-2) Provide information about cases and intensive care beds.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Italian experience and current trends in other countries indicate that the EU/EEA and the UK's COVID-19 pandemic are rapidly developing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, the state, hospitals, and intensive care units should be prepared to cope with the continuous community spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the need for medical care, especially the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care, such as the emergence of affected areas in Italy Case.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment pointed out, a rapid, active and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, because if not implemented in advance, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may be There is not enough time for policy makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adjust response measures.</seg>
<seg id="42">The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is currently a short window of opportunity, and countries may use this to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health care system.</seg>
<seg id="44">Otherwise, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">The origin of human coronavirus in zoonoses</seg>
<seg id="2">For thousands of years, mutation and adaptability have driven the co-evolution of Coronaviruses (CoV) and their hosts (including humans).</seg>
<seg id="3">Before 2003, two types of human coronavirus (HCoV) were known to cause mild diseases such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation and revealed the destructive and fatal nature of HCoV infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 once again made CoV the focus of attention. Surprisingly, compared with its sister virus SARS-CoV, it is more spreadable but less pathogenic. .</seg>
<seg id="6">HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease, so it is helpful for us to understand the origin of HCoV's zoonotic disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most HCoV is derived from bats and is non-pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some HCoV intermediate storage hosts are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">Identifying animal hosts is of direct significance for preventing human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studying the interaction of CoV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of human CoV.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we outline the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, highlighting their discovery history, origin of zoonotic diseases, and interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Importantly, we compared and controlled different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome reorganization.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this context, we discussed the current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, this article also focuses on the requirements for successful host switching and the impact of virus evolution on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">CoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of sense single-stranded RNA viruses with an envelope.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, containing between 26,000 and 32,000 bases, and are known as "coronaviruses" (CoV) due to their coronal appearance under an electron microscope.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, CoV has a non-segmented genome that shares similar tissues.</seg>
<seg id="18">About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains ORFs of structural proteins, including spikes (S), envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">Many lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by CoV of different lineages.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the differences in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four genera (Î±-CoV, Î²-CoV, Î³-CoV, and Î´-CoV), where the Î²-CoV genus contains most HCoV and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">Phylogenetic evidence indicates that bats and rodents are the gene source of most Î±-CoV and Î²-CoV, and birds are the main hosts of Î³-CoV and Î´-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, seven types of human coronavirus (HCoV) are known.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are Î±-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other five types of Î²-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress Syndrome (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the mid-1960s, the first HCoV-229E virus strain B814 was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with common colds.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, through extensive research on both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that can cause self-limiting symptoms, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, before the outbreak of SARS, the concept that HCoV infection was usually harmless was widely accepted.</seg>
<seg id="33">The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 infected people and a crude mortality rate of about 10%.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">2019 The new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the continuously prevalent 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As of March 3, 2020, more than 3,120 lives have been captured and infected More than 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm has sounded and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin from bats, mice, or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">Various evidences indicate that all the evolution of HCoV originated in bats. The viruses in bats are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic has brought huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.</seg>
<seg id="40">Tracking the origin of HCoVâs zoonotic disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces, and limiting factors of viral species jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, this will guide or promote the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts, and expanded animal hosts, and is of great significance for preventing future virus spills.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this review, we outline the origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoV zoonoses.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we emphasized and discussed a common problem, that is, the parental virus of HCoV is usually not pathogenic in its natural storage host, but is pathogenic after spreading across species to a new host.</seg>
<seg id="44">In addition, we also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV, in which the increase in transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.</seg>
<seg id="45">In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal CoV has been widely known since the late 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the first isolation of the HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal secretions of patients with common colds, medical scientists have isolated various infected animals (including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs) Different CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the past few decades, 7 HCoVs have been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="49">A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will provide us with rich information and guidance.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 1966, the first HCoV-229E virus strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection and subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell strain.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort, and sore throat, and 10-20% of patients have fever and cough.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture of the suckling mouse brain and subsequent serial passage.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, and the symptoms are not very different from other respiratory pathogens (such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus) infection.</seg>
<seg id="54">HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed all over the world, mainly in winter in temperate climates.</seg>
<seg id="55">Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, after which the onset will occur for about 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="56">A human volunteer study showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E will develop a mild common cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few patients with immunocompromise show serious lower respiratory tract infections.</seg>
<seg id="58">SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first fully documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history. Its pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first SARS case can be traced back to Guangdong Province, China, at the end of 2002.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">In addition to super-transmitters, it is estimated that each case may bring about 2 secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load on the 10th day of onset.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise, and chills, followed by advanced symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and respiratory distress.</seg>
<seg id="63">Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory test abnormalities of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="64">In addition, diffuse alveolar injury, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In these critically ill patients, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys may also be infected, and are usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal in patients with immunocompromised .</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a source patient who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, people have been devoted to HCoV research.</seg>
<seg id="69">HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="70">The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study showed that the same virus was isolated from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence is in early summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis (also known as Grub's laryngitis).</seg>
<seg id="76">In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, there are reports of HCoV-HKU1 associated with acute asthma attacks.</seg>
<seg id="78">Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found all over the world and can cause mild respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases. However, accidents have occurred and the cause is unknown. For example, HCoV-NL63 is a rare and more toxic subtype. Recently, it has been reported that this subtype causes severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Normally, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively spread and survive in the human body, their toxicity or pathogenicity will also decrease.</seg>
<seg id="81">MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although most laboratory-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary transmission to close contacts.</seg>
<seg id="83">In 2015, secondary sexual transmission broke out again in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="84">The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also have acute renal failure, which is a unique feature of MERS in the diseases caused by HCoV so far.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, with a case fatality rate of 34.4%, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">In mid-to-late December 2019, patients with aggregated pneumonia were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and were retrospectively analyzed and confirmed to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been diagnosed worldwide, with a crude mortality rate of 3.4%.</seg>
<seg id="91">It is worth noting that the case fatality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the case fatality rate outside Hubei is 1.2%.</seg>
<seg id="92">Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory tract infections, manifested by fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some patients also experience diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% homology of high nucleotide sequences, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.</seg>
<seg id="96">Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic, but more contagious.</seg>
<seg id="97">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections may have accelerated the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other 6 HCoVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="100">At this point, the general trend of SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the other six HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (ie, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, the characteristics exhibited by SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in community-acquired HCoV infections, including non-specific, mild, or even asymptomatic manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, a small proportion of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infection cases, although the proportion is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows the interesting pattern characteristics of community-acquired HCoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, the spreadability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as community-acquired HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, whether the spreadability of SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will decline after human passage is still to be verified.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">At least in some cases, whether the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in SARS-CoV remains to be clarified in future studies.</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, it is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal like community-acquired HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, such as its spreadability, pathogenicity and continuous transmission after human passage, will have an important impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="111">All 4 community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">From another perspective, humans have also adapted well to these four HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both parties may be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="114">HCoV, which causes serious human diseases, and people with severe HCoV diseases have died out.</seg>
<seg id="115">To this end, HCoV must replicate enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations to fight host restriction factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people infected, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it can adapt well, its spread in humans will be difficult to prevent by isolation or other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">Over the years, these four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread among people, causing people with normal immune systems to suffer from a common cold.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require animal hosts.</seg>
<seg id="120">In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans, nor can they continue to spread among humans.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to survive and multiply in zoonotic hosts, and may find opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate hosts and expanded hosts.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is as contagious as community-acquired HCoV, at least for now.</seg>
<seg id="124">However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">Whether it can fully adapt to humans and circulate within humans without a host or intermediate animal remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, it is of certain guiding significance for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host and expanded host of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="127">If an animal has closely related ancestors that are highly homologous at the nucleotide sequence level, the animal will become an evolutionary host for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="128">Progenitor viruses are usually highly adaptable and non-pathogenic in this host.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, the storage host will continue to carry HCoV for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host for HCoV or its parental virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">In contrast, if HCoV just parasitized the intermediate host shortly or soon after, it would not be able to adapt well to the new host and is usually pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate host can serve as a source of zoonotic human infections, and by allowing the virus to replicate briefly, and then spread it to humans to expand the scale of human infections, thereby playing the role of amplifying the host.</seg>
<seg id="133">If HCoV cannot maintain its transmission in the intermediate host, terminal infection may occur.</seg>
<seg id="134">On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even establish a long-term endemic.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural storage host.</seg>
<seg id="136">Retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that index cases of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.</seg>
<seg id="137">Subsequent seropositivity surveys showed that compared with the general population, the levels of anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) in animal dealers were higher.</seg>
<seg id="138">On the live animal market, civet cats (flower raccoon cats) and a raccoon cat were found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses almost identical to SARS-CoV viruses for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="139">After removing all civet cats from the market, there is no further SARS report, which indirectly supports the above view.</seg>
<seg id="140">However, the report states that wild or untouched live animal market civets have basically tested negative for SARS-CoV, indicating that civets may only be intermediate amplification hosts rather than natural hosts for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is worth noting that since 80% of different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that a variety of small mammals may also serve as the intermediate expansion host for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="142">All these animals seem to be the end hosts of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="143">Subsequent research on the SARS-CoV natural animal host found a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-related chrysanthemum coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survived in the Chinese chrysanthemum bat.</seg>
<seg id="144">These bats were positive for the SARS-CoV antibody and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.</seg>
<seg id="145">The virus and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">In addition, the researchers also identified multiple SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but with the exception of a designated WIV1, no virus can be isolated as a live virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known receptor for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="149">Experiments have shown that WIV1 extracted from bat fecal samples uses bat, civet, and human ACE2 as its receptors into cells.</seg>
<seg id="150">Interestingly, the serum of SARS convalescent patients can neutralize WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to the bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.</seg>
<seg id="152">Although these two viruses are highly homologous, WIV1 is not generally considered to be a direct parental virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not a direct storage host of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">Phylogenetic analysis classified MERS-CoV and bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5 into the same group.</seg>
<seg id="154">Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenically closer to the corresponding RNA in bat Î²-CoV from Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.</seg>
<seg id="157">MERS-CoV has only 87% nucleotide sequence homology with its close relative, CoV-HKU25.</seg>
<seg id="158">Therefore, bats may not be the direct storage host of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are positive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as are the camels originating in the Middle East in many African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">The live MERS-CoV isolated from the nasal swab of the dromedary came from the same virus found in humans, which further indicates that the camel is the true storage host of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It should also be noted that in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, the general symptoms were mild, but a large amount of virus shedding was observed.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is worth noting that infected camels not only spread the virus through the respiratory tract, but also spread the virus through the faecal-oral route, which is also the main route for bats to distribute the virus.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, the problem still exists because many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the symptoms appear, which may be due to human-to-human or unknown routes of transmission, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV RaTG13, a bat isolated from A. chinensis.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to determine the parental relationship.</seg>
<seg id="166">In other words, unless almost identical bat coronaviruses are discovered in the future, bats may not be a direct storage host for SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="167">It is speculated that among the wild animal species that the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be sold and slaughtered in the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, many of the initial COVID-19 cases were related to it, indicating that an animal-to-human transmission event may have occurred .</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have shown that an endangered small mammal called the pangolin (Malay pangolin) may also carry the ancestor Î²-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">These new pangolin coronavirus genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with about 90% homology at the nucleotide sequence level.</seg>
<seg id="171">In the phylogenetic tree, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2-like virus sublines, one of which has a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2 and has a 97.4% amino acid sequence Homology.</seg>
<seg id="172">In sharp contrast, the RBD difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is greater, although the genome-wide sequence homology between the two is higher.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, and the results were similar to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">This study used different assembly methods and manual processing to obtain a partial genome sequence that accounts for about 86.3% of the entire genome of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="175">We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to differences in the Î²-CoV sequence associated with SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from pangolin.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the Î²-CoV associated with pangolin SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="178">The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="179">Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the Î²-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 related to SARS-CoV-2 had the highest genome-wide sequence homology Sex.</seg>
<seg id="180">It can be highly speculated that the high similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related Î²-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD is caused by selective-mediated convergence evolution.</seg>
<seg id="181">Another contrary view is that pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related Î²-CoV and RaTG13 are recombined in a third wild animal species.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread in Î²-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="183">The direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is currently inconclusive.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the researchers also studied the origin of zoonotic diseases of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.</seg>
<seg id="185">Phylogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may both originate from bat coronavirus, and the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">According to the report, the bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in North American tricolor bats is shown to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus (called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008) found in Ghana, and camels are also suspected to be their intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity, Figure 1 and Table 2 summarize the existing knowledge about the animal origin of known HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="189">Phylogenetic analysis provides evidence for the interspecies transmission events of HCoV in history.</seg>
<seg id="190">Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from cross-species of domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases emerged.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="192">The bat Î±-CoV closely related to HCoV-229E has been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="193">Between the two appeared an alpaca Î±-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is a lot of evidence to support the spread of viruses from bats to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, humans, not alpaca, may come into contact with bats in a common niche.</seg>
<seg id="196">On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, the bat Î±-CoV associated with HCoV-229E is diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpaca Î±-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory diseases in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, no alpaca Î±-CoV was found in wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Therefore, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that the alpaca obtains Î±-CoV related to HCoV-229E from humans.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">Therefore, it is not surprising that bats spread HCoV-229E directly to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">Or, although the bat Î±-CoV acts as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpaca and dromedaries may be intermediate hosts that spread the virus to humans, which is exactly the same as MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV is a good illustration of the interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV of bats was known from its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries reinforce this argument.</seg>
<seg id="205">Obviously, bats provide a rich virus species library for the interspecies exchange and interspecies transmission of gene fragments.</seg>
<seg id="206">Long-lived and dense groups, close social interaction and strong flying ability are all favorable conditions for bats to become ideal "virus spreaders".</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the dromedary for decades.</seg>
<seg id="208">It adapts well to these camels, and camels have also changed from intermediate hosts to stable natural storage hosts.</seg>
<seg id="209">MERS-CoV causes very mild disease in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">Its sporadic spread to humans is an accident, and due to the unsustainable spread, humans are still the terminal host of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="211">Compared with the role of camels in the spread of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (if any) is different.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, pangolin Î²-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="213">They may be the terminal hosts of Î²-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the civet cats in SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">In future studies, several possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans must be determined or excluded.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, the bat may be a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans may share niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="217">Secondly, pangolin may be one of the intermediate expansion hosts for the new invasion of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses.</seg>
<seg id="218">Humans are infected with viruses by slaughtering and eating game.</seg>
<seg id="219">Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">It is necessary to carry out antibody surveys on domestic animals and wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="221">Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may recombine and adapt in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="222">Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to different types of animal hosts, the three main viral factors also play an important role in promoting coronaviruses to cross interspecies barriers.</seg>
<seg id="224">First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared with other single-stranded RNA viruses, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is estimated to be "moderate" to "high". According to the adaptation stage of coronaviruses to new hosts, the average replacement rate per site 2 is about 10-4 times per year .</seg>
<seg id="226">Coronavirus has a proofreading activity of exonuclease, and its deletion will lead to very high variability and attenuation, and even cannot survive.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, the nucleoside analog Remdesivir is known to inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="228">Redoxir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the mutation rate of coronavirus is about 1 million times higher than that of its host.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, if the coronavirus does not adapt well to the host, its mutation rate will usually be high.</seg>
<seg id="231">Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate, indicating a higher adaptability to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">It can be speculated that it has adapted to another host close to humans.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that is well adapted to dromedary.</seg>
<seg id="234">In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 rapidly ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="235">Secondly, the larger RNA genome of coronavirus has additional plasticity in the modification of gene mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the possibility of inter-species co-evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="236">The large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3'end of the genome provide evidence for this.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch templates through a unique "copy selection" mechanism during RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="238">In the host as a mixing container, chain exchange frequently occurs during CoV RNA transcription.</seg>
<seg id="239">Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNA can recombine to produce new coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="240">Phylogenetic evidence of natural reorganization has been found in animal coronaviruses such as HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.</seg>
<seg id="241">Virus-host interactions related to transmission</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction between the virus and the host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="243">This article takes the reorganization of SARS-CoV as a typical example and shows evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on the comparative analysis of SARS-CoV isolates from human and civets, the researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through mutation of the S protein RBD to achieve this process.</seg>
<seg id="245">In general, the RBD in the coronavirus S protein interacts with cellular receptors and will be closely screened for host antibody responses.</seg>
<seg id="246">In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318th to 510th amino acids of the S1 fragment, and it binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptor to allow the virus to enter.</seg>
<seg id="247">SARS-CoV's RBD can recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civet cats, mice and civet cats, so that the virus spreads between species.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, only 6 amino acid residues different from human and civet virus isolates were observed in RBD, 4 of which are located in the receptor binding motif that interacts with the ACE2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="249">There are K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of Civet SARS-CoV, which may increase the affinity of the fibronectin to interact with the human ACE2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have the same cell receptor.</seg>
<seg id="252">The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein is 30%, which means that the binding affinity between the S protein and human ACE2 may have changed.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a cryo-electron microscopy study showed that this binding affinity is 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.</seg>
<seg id="254">It will also make sense to determine whether any other co-receptors are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.</seg>
<seg id="255">Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but binds to different parts of S.</seg>
<seg id="256">In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptidase N of HCoV-229E and the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid of HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also explain why the coronaviruses described above successfully adapted to humans after spreading from animal hosts across species.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cell receptors, the results of HCoV interspecies transmission are also influenced by other host-dependent and restrictive factors.</seg>
<seg id="259">Differences in these host proteins between humans and natural HCoV hosts such as bats, dromedaries, and rodents may constitute barriers to interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">HCoV must deprive host dependence factors and break host limitation factors in order to successfully achieve interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this regard, the molecular determinants in the important field of virus-host interaction still need to be determined and characterized.</seg>
<seg id="262">Unbiased genome-wide screening of the host-dependent and limiting factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may yield results.</seg>
<seg id="263">The emergence of new HCoV: back to the original point</seg>
<seg id="264">The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, bat coronavirus acts as a gene pool for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and gene recombination are also the driving factors of HCoV evolution, and are two important steps in this process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the gain or loss of genes encoding new proteins may completely change the phenotype of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, SARS-CoV-associated bat viruses were isolated, but it was found that they can encode different ORF8 proteins, so it is considered that ORF8 is very important for adapting to humans.</seg>
<seg id="269">At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide deletion characteristics of SARS-CoV were found in the isolated virus strains.</seg>
<seg id="270">This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV may have recombined with the Î±- and Î³-CoV lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombination regions were found in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="272">Recombination sites have also been found in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, studies have shown that the prevalence of MERS-CoV has undergone recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in the dromedary of Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoV and other animal coronaviruses recombined in their non-structural genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be noted that manual selection may cause unexpected changes in the viral genome, which is most likely due to reducing the selection pressure imposed by the virus on the host's immune system.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of these effects is that in the HCoV-229E prototype virus strain, the deletion of dinucleotides resulted in the deletion of full-length ORF4.</seg>
<seg id="277">Although the complete ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca Î±-CoV showed a single nucleotide insertion, causing a frameshift mutation.</seg>
<seg id="278">Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by storage host selection pressure.</seg>
<seg id="279">After the bat was infected with coronavirus, asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected, indicating that the coronavirus and the bat adapted to each other.</seg>
<seg id="280">From an anatomical and physiological point of view, bats seem to adapt well to coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, defects in the activation of bat proinflammatory responses effectively reduce the pathological changes caused by coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and the lower expression level of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, the natural killer cell activity of bats is inhibited.</seg>
<seg id="283">Moreover, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the bat's high metabolic activity can both inhibit the replication of coronavirus and influence the proofreading by exonuclease, thereby providing selective pressure for the virus strain to enter into a new host with high pathogenicity.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt to the host.</seg>
<seg id="285">Therefore, it is not accidental that three new HCoVs have appeared in the past two decades.</seg>
<seg id="286">Coronavirus does not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They replicate a lot and do not cause a strong host immune response.</seg>
<seg id="288">This is why there are asymptomatic carriers and serious human infections.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of the immune response and cytokine storm, so the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.</seg>
<seg id="290">In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from coronavirus replication.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy to delink the immune response may have a positive effect in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.</seg>
<seg id="292">The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="293">Therefore, it should be beneficial to use type I interferon at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is also defective.</seg>
<seg id="295">Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to suppress the NLRP3 inflammasome may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are based.</seg>
<seg id="297">Although bat Î²-CoV with 95% nucleotide homology to SARS-CoV has been found, there is also a bat coronavirus with 96% nucleotide homology to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although civet cats and other animals on the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="299">At present, pangolin Î²-CoV, which is obviously homologous with SARS-CoV-2, has been found, which indicates that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin Î²-CoV may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="301">Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus has once again become the focus of attention.</seg>
<seg id="302">Research on coronaviruses in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the origin of HCoV zoonoses and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">Extensive evidence indicates that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="304">Since SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civet cats on the market, closing the wet goods market and killing civet cats can effectively end the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">Similarly, given the discovery of multiple pedigrees of pangolin Î²-CoV closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be further studied.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedary for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels are important means of transportation and the main source of local people's meat, milk, leather and wool products.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">Therefore, it is impossible to follow the practice of the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and sacrifice all camels to control MERS.</seg>
<seg id="311">In order to stop the recurrence of MERS, comprehensive measures should be taken in conjunction with other infection control measures to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camels.</seg>
<seg id="312">Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear, which in turn may cause outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="313">Various zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in the wild.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, the diversity of bat coronaviruses with potential for zoonotic diseases is quite high.</seg>
<seg id="315">These zoonotic coronaviruses have many opportunities for evolution and recombination, leading to new coronaviruses that are more likely to be transmitted and/or deadly in humans in the future.</seg>
<seg id="316">In some places in China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="317">After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should formulate better prevention and response plans.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They stay in their natural hosts until opportunities for overflow occur.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although bats have many characteristics that are conducive to virus transmission, if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wild species, human exposure to bats and other wild species will be greatly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="321">In order to better understand the ecological status of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, it is necessary to continuously monitor mammals. Facts will prove that this is very useful for preventing the spread of animals to humans and future outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="322">In short, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is that humans should stay away from the niche of the natural host of zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="323">There are still a few missing points in the mystery of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 zoonosis.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it makes sense to examine the circumstances under which bats and pangolins can share the same niche.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if bats play a more direct role in human communication, how humans contact bats remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if the third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, because many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection studies should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the case of bats, pangolins or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parental virus will be found in natural hosts in the future.</seg>
<seg id="329">Continued research in this area will reveal the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.</seg>
