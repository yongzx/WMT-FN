<seg id="3">High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising living standards in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economical passenger and freight transport is an important task of the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="6">It requires a high degree of organizational, technical and financial effort.</seg>
<seg id="7">The establishment and development of a sustainable European transport infrastructure often requires difficult compromises with European and national policy objectives, such as preserving the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures, the construction of the transport infrastructure is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="9">When planning and allocating the construction of transport routes, administrations can, through careful action and decision-making, save substantial financial resources and use them for other useful purposes.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify deficiencies that prevent optimum economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness in expenditure on the construction of transport facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also make suggestions for improvement for the benefit of citizens and for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Court (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ), carried out parallel audits of the expenses for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (motorway D.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two highways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">As part of the cooperation with BRH, NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the planning progress, the date of completion was finally set at the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the award procedure, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes which delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint audit work, the prices of motorway bridges on D 8 and A 17 were compared. The standard for comparing the price of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.</seg>
<seg id="24">A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square meter.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis showed that the border bridge under the large bridges with lengths of more than 100 m was the most expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of delays in the award.</seg>
<seg id="27">The comparison of the prices of tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels under D 8 are significantly higher than the prices of similar tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">In future audits of the profitability of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH and NKÚ may rely on a collection of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both invoices recommend standardizing bridge constructions and executing steel composite and special constructions only where prestressed concrete constructions are inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The examination process was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel examination, the examiners of both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report covers the parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">Auditing priorities were economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel tests carried out by the Federal Republic of Germany and NKÚ in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="36">in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The NKÚ examined the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway in the amount of approximately CZK 20 billion gross (approximately €690 million).</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million will be allocated from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">Regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ, the BRH had already tested the design and construction of the A 17 motorway between 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of approximately €670 million will co-finance €277 million from the European Funds (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European transport corridor IV Dresden - Central and Southeastern Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech/German border,</seg>
<seg id="43">the A 17 from the border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of testing, the borderline sections of the motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 on the Czech side remains incomplete, since the route section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">Here the crossing of a protected landscape area in the Bohemian Central Mountains is provided.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the traffic volume in 2008 in the borderline section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will be 22 940 cars per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">German forecasts estimate the traffic volume on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 25 000 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded an agreement to merge the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 at the common state border by establishing a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction measure was an important aspect of the parallel audits of both auditors.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="53">Starting in mid- 2005, both Audit Offices discussed collaborating on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany partly finances the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.</seg>
<seg id="58">There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The NKÚ had no comparative data to assess whether the funds were used economically with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The NKÚ also had to check the effectiveness of the expenditure. For this purpose, the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels should be examined, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory negotiations, the Presidents of the two Court of Auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of audits of the Prague-Dresden motorway on 04 January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="64">The auditors of both auditors met in the course of 2006 at approximately six to eight week intervals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for checking bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and produced joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">The ongoing exchange of information was essential to the cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH focused on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs, and hence the way in which the two auditors complete their audits.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, each authority produced separate national reports on its audit results.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 Treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.</seg>
<seg id="74">Later it postponed the appointment by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as the client of the construction measure.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany finances the bridge construction to 42.13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">Initially, the RMD provided for a prestressed concrete construction for the boundary bridge.</seg>
<seg id="78">However, in 1999 RMD and its German partner agreed on the construction of a steel composite structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">They justified this decision by reducing the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had shown the composite steel construction as the more cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, this was due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite structure of only 397 m,</seg>
<seg id="83">however, it is actually 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the procurement procedure, the RMD underwent serious errors:</seg>
<seg id="85">by inadequately preparing the procurement documents and describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.</seg>
<seg id="86">These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Valuation Commission and the Director-General of the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="87">A subordinate tenderer challenged the outcome of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation of the Czech antitrust office delayed the signing of the building contract for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a result, the following summer construction season was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="90">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time. This led to a significant price increase.</seg>
<seg id="91">Among the measures offered were the double assembly of the superstructures, the change of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally intended steel grade.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new steel grade - whose higher costs of approximately €4 million were borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time provided for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the offer price of approximately €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further supplements will significantly increase the overall construction costs of the frontier bridge.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened construction time alone led to a price increase of approximately €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">Excluding price guidance, costs are currently around €25.9 million net (as at October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both auditors examined the bridge prices at D 8 and A 17 in order to identify the bridges which were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="101">When preparing this part of the audit, a precise definition of the price concept was important.</seg>
<seg id="102">For the comparison of bridge prices, both auditors agreed on detailed specifications, for example: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="103">(The VAT rates in the Czech Republic and in Germany are different and may vary.), the costs of special start-up measures should not be taken into account, the exchange rate of the European Central Bank dated 30.12.2005 should be used for currency conversion. (29 CZK = 1 €).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of different types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.</seg>
<seg id="106">The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">Most common on both sides of the border were concrete bridges (20 bridges at D 8 and 36 bridges at A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The study focused on this type of bridge, since the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The study showed that the m ² price of the concrete bridges on the D 8/A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the square meter price.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see figures below).</seg>
<seg id="111">On the A 17 two bridges could be found, on the D 8 four bridges with significantly increased price.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges were determined partly by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified using the distance to the regression curve).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, the atypically high price of these bridges should serve only as a clue to which bridges should be concentrated.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw final conclusions, the causes of the respective high price should be determined on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id="115">This could be due, for example, to uneconomical administrative action, but also to the requirements for the protection of the environment or other legitimate reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length expected Czech concrete bridges to be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">This was also supported by lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">Two reasons for this were identified during joint meetings:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are predominantly awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="122">This also allows medium-sized enterprises to participate in the award competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridge buildings are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.</seg>
<seg id="124">Orders of this magnitude cannot be handled by medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge structures built is greater than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the NKÚ noted that the construction of bridges is defined long before construction begins,</seg>
<seg id="128">already when the RMD submits the application for planning.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this point in time, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, profitability plays a minor role in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">Only by a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would a definitive conclusion have been possible with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have blown up the scope of this examination.</seg>
<seg id="131">The boundary bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The significant price differences may be the result of too low a level of competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow generalizing conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Efficiency and efficiency of the Dresden motorway - Prague</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The plan was to gradually expand the D 8 from Prague to the state border in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">The route section 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains should be built in front of the border section 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic finances D 8 under programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">The programme number 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 Prague motorway - Ústí nad Labem - Czech German state border" defines two objectives:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">as a national objective: to improve the link between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.</seg>
<seg id="147">The programme planned to complete the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The NKÚ noted that the planning decision had already been adopted for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental associations have complained against this decision.</seg>
<seg id="151">A final verdict is pending.</seg>
<seg id="152">Therefore, compared to the schedule provided for in the programme documentation, a delay in the completion of route section No. 0805 by several years could not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of construction section No. 0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">Due to this, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD subjected the border section No 0807 of the D 8 and the section No 0805 by the Bohemian Central Mountains to a profitability study between 1999 and 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">As investment costs, it invested approximately €639 million for both sections 0805 and 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the profitability study (EIRR = Internal rate of return)</seg>
<seg id="158">Variant opening of all planned highways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic volume in the north part of the border section 18 000 motor vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">Opening of all planned highways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Traffic volume in the north part of the border section 22 000 motor vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">Opening of all planned highways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic volume in the north part of the border section 25 000 motor vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic viability survey conducted in 2001 was based on the assumption that the borderline and the section passing through the Bohemian Central Mountains are simultaneously under traffic.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the examination it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains will not be opened on the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The costs of both sections were € 31.12.2005 million excluding VAT at the 897, and thus 27.4% higher than 2001 in the economic performance analysis.</seg>
<seg id="168">In addition, there is a risk that Section 0805 will receive another more complex course of the line, which would affect the profitability of the project.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economics analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18 000 motor vehicles per day in 2010.The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22 940 motor vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 cars per day in 2007. The project is then below the cost-effectiveness limit.</seg>
<seg id="171">A higher volume of traffic on the routes intended to replace the missing section by the Bohemian Central Mountains is highly likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs which were not taken into account in the initial economic assessment.</seg>
<seg id="172">The above-mentioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D 8 is not achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the border section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomical.</seg>
<seg id="174">Cost increases also occurred in the construction of the A 17 as in the construction of the two above mentioned. Sections of D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the macroeconomic assessment for the Federal Transport Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for transport assumed investment costs of around €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">This gave it a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">Meanwhile, costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit/cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">Regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ, the BRH had tested the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway between 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">In doing so, he noted that the authority responsible for the authorisation requested an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the road administration of the superfluous nature tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="181">This avoided € 10 million in construction costs and € 150,000 in annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">During the examination of the first section of A 17, the BRH found that the construction measure was insufficiently prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">During the planning phase, the road construction administration dispensed with a state detection of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschener wall, since it was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">Only when the tunnel advance reached the wall did it catch up.</seg>
<seg id="186">This showed that the rock was weathered to a greater extent than was assumed in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">Complex measures such as anchorages, injections and stone impact protection nets for around €3.3 million were necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road construction administration did not only bear the costs for additional, anyway required, such as securing the Dölzschener wall, but also for those which would not have been necessary in the case of proper construction preparation.</seg>
<seg id="189">This includes expenditure due to impaired construction processes (€3.2 million), additional incorporation of the drive crew (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of construction time (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million does not represent any lasting added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to better assume the specialist supervision for large road construction measures.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, it should insist that road construction administrations introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Advantages of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation fulfilled the expectations of both auditors.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH received insights on the planning, awarding and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both auditors developed a database of bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.</seg>
<seg id="196">The NKÚ noted that the main construction parameters for bridges, tunnels and road surfaces of the D 8 are not different from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The co-operation auditors of both auditors gained valuable experience, which will be useful in future audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Preface</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, underlines the power of the Court of Auditors to audit all public finances.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration requires the Court of Auditors to have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Organisation of European Supreme Audit Authorities (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important component of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thematic focus of VI. EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is especially true of taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.</seg>
<seg id="9">Given that national economies are increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation can arise in which national auditors can only carry out their audit activities in cooperation with the auditors of other countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example may be the examination of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the fight against such crimes, cooperation between the authorities is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="12">Court of Auditors auditing in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea for an audit of VAT and the MIAS system is presented by VI. EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and the procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the basis of the analysis of the available information, we selected the test items for the examination planning.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving effective and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual countries (particularly EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and increase transparency in this area.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.</seg>

<seg id="24">the Commission's objective:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to investigate the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of turnover tax, following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as the "EC") with the free movement of goods and services and the use of the MIAS1, in particular the control of turnover claims.</seg>
<seg id="26">(DE) The aim of the examination was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, in accordance with the aforementioned Regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to address them.</seg>
<seg id="28">VAT information exchange system Based on an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006, the audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Bundesrech-nungshof ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="29">The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international assistance between financial administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two states.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI auditing standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The period under review covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the 'exchange of information' priority under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="35">The review also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by coach and the comparison of statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">When comparing VAT management systems in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany the traders are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is the exceeding of the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, the taxpayer receives a tax code for VAT purposes which applies only to domestic transactions.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German tax payer wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must request the issuance of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="42">Since the different registration procedures give rise to problems, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and bus.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, international passenger transport by coach is free of VAT, but there is a right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT insofar as the route passes through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation under Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover taxation (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">Whilst in the Czech Republic the tax-liable VAT returns only have to be submitted for underage tax periods (month or quarter), tax payers in Germany (monthly or quarterly)</seg>
<seg id="49">VAT pre-registrations and after the end of the calendar year to submit a VAT annual return.</seg>
<seg id="50">In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany have to submit VAT pre-filings electronically.</seg>
<seg id="51">The introduction of the electronic VAT return policy in the Czech Republic would improve the effectiveness of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="52">4) Summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="53">While taxpayers in the Czech Republic must submit their Summary Reports to the Tax Offices, German taxpayers must submit the Summary Reports to the CLO2.</seg>
<seg id="54">Accordingly, in the Czech Republic, the information contained in the Summary Reports is available immediately after its submission.</seg>
<seg id="55">The data from the Summary Reports are only available to German companies after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="56">To combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="57">The monthly submission of Summary Reports would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the update of MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="58">This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the event of a request for information, the Czech CLO shall monitor compliance with the three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the prescribed period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German CLO constantly monitor the deadlines (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each Member State must develop its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">Within the framework of the cooperation, the two Court of Auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="69">Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed by using the legal possibilities of the CLO in which there were doubts as to the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The Court of Auditors found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, they used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the tax payers concerned.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the taxpayers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or failed to show the acquisition of goods in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, they could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because they were incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be recovered due to different laws in the two Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused the information requested.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some cases have been uncovered where tax payers incorrectly reported sales in their Summary Reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the specialist had to determine in these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Examination procedures</seg>
<seg id="79">Examination procedure in the CR</seg>
<seg id="80">The check became in the period from June, 2006 to March, 2007 from the department II - "a state budgetary income" and the territorial exam departments central Bohemians, northwest Bohemians, south Bohemians, Südmähren, Zentralmähren and Nordmähren carried out.</seg>
<seg id="81">Audited posts were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 CET Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaya, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The College of NKÚ approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Examination procedure in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The examination was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase, the actual test began in the 4 quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files from the following SITES were included in the audit:</seg>

<seg id="93">The examination results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors</seg>
<seg id="95">In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held between representatives of both auditors.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants in these meetings became familiar with the organization of the financial administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in the other country.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject matter of the test phase was agreed upon at the meeting in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics for the parallel tests were determined: 1.</seg>
<seg id="100">Registration of tax controllers.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">Cross-border passenger transport with buses - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of financial officials in the processing of requests for information and the verification of selected problems mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary messages.</seg>

<seg id="118">An entrepreneur with legal headquarters, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 shall become liable for payment on the first day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the threshold (§ 94/1). hereinafter referred to as "Law No 235/2004").</seg>
<seg id="119">The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.</seg>
<seg id="120">Current legislation does not allow retroactive registration of a tax payer if he has exceeded the registration deadline.</seg>
<seg id="121">An entrepreneur with legal domicile, place of business or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides VAT-relevant services or VAT-exempt services with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he/she has fulfilled other conditions in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="122">An entrepreneur with legal headquarters, registered office or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law may apply voluntarily for VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="123">The registration procedure in accordance with Law No 337/1992 begins when the application for registration is received by the local financial officer.</seg>
<seg id="124">If you wish to register voluntarily for VAT, you must indicate in your application the deadline from which you apply for registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The financial officer shall verify the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all attachments.</seg>
<seg id="126">If it has doubts about the information contained therein, it shall ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="127">If the financial officer has determined by verification that the entrepreneur meets the conditions for registration, he shall issue a written communication on the registration and allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision shall indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the VAT assessment period.</seg>
<seg id="129">The assessment period shall be the calendar quarter; unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="130">If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the financial officer of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The issuing of a tax code in the registration notice is always constitutive.</seg>
<seg id="133">The taxpayer shall provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the financial officer, and in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law No 235/2004, concerning the drafting of tax documents) 3.</seg>
<seg id="134">The control number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification character.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as a special law so specifies. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No 337/1992).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his repatriation despite a request from the financial officer, the financier must register him of his own motion.</seg>
<seg id="137">A communication will also be issued to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, every trader authorised for a business activity receives a tax number when he first registers for any type of tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">Pursuant to Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the obligation, the financial officer may not require the registration of VAT; that the taxable person has up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable transaction; the person concerned has acted unlawfully without taxation for the period from the date, from which the trader should have been registered as a taxpayer; until the date on which registration as a taxpayer took place by order of the tax official (§ 98 (1) of Law No 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount thus fixed is considered to be a tax payment within the meaning of Paragraph 98 (3) of Law No 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="142">If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VAT holder can be deleted for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of the registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="145">A taxpayer may request the cancellation of his registration not earlier than one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Cancellation of registration of its own motion (§ 106 (7) of Law No 235/2004), if: (a) the taxpayer has not provided a service for a period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the financial officer of the reasons for this, (b) the taxpayer has not fulfilled its aberrations in accordance with Law No 235/2004, (c) the previous taxpayer no longer meets the conditions for the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Taxpayers without legal headquarters, registered offices or offices in the Czech Republic A person, registered for tax purposes in another Member State and not having its legal headquarters in the Czech Republic; The place of business still has a permanent establishment or a tax-liable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and, pursuant to Section 108 of Law No 235/2004, has to file a tax return for these services or deliveries and pay taxes ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes taxpayable with the provision of the relevant service.</seg>
<seg id="148">He must submit an application for registration at the FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery concerned.</seg>
<seg id="149">It is leaked, in this application all VAT IDNs allocated to it in other Member States or third countries. to brag.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration later than on the day of the first tax-liable provision of services in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 FA shall register him retroactively, since he became subject to VAT under Law No 235/2004 on the day of the first tax-liable provision of services in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the event of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require the contractors concerned to provide proof of performance (invoices or written explanations).</seg>
<seg id="152">If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic prior to the first performance of a service, the Prague 1 FA shall request the submission of the contract documents which are based on the performance.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the Prague 1 FA, 124 of them from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No 235/2004, the financial officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on 31 January of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the postponement for filing tax applications or returns and for paying taxes.</seg>
<seg id="155">When the NKÚ was examined, it was found that in the case of a tax return by mail sent abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA by 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of cancellation of registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, it is no longer possible to cancel the registration of the non-resident trader at VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of tax payers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In accordance with the provisions of the Tax Ordinance (§ § 137, 138 AO), every business operation must be registered with the municipality and/or the competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">This notification shall be made no later than one month after the commencement of the business.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the competent tax office finds that a business has been started but has not been notified, it can also register the tax payer ex officio retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Tax payers in Germany, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are liable for registration for Zwekke VAT if they meet the requirements of § 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">For entrepreneurs resident abroad, special ZF are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="166">Thus is, e.g., for those enterprisers who have her seat in Czech Republic, the FA the Chemnitz south responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.</seg>
<seg id="168">According to the Federal Republic of Germany, these companies with special responsibilities refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new medium or medium-sized companies. Eastern European Member States of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten States to the EC, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These (note) self-employed persons do not fulfil the conditions for recognition as entrepreneurs laid down in § 2 UStG, since they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work execution.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the undertaking and the business activity carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a form that is binding on all German companies.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either in special organizational units within the ZF or in the organizational units generally responsible for the tax investment.</seg>
<seg id="174">This form is used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual tax controller prior to the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax code for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, The following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, The following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the tax controller, the last digit is always a control digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is allocated by the CLO on request if the trader is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="179">The VAT IDNr. is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxpayer declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-declarations or in his VAT annual return.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT IDNr. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. Upon request (e.g. when he ceases business activities), but only after all taxation transactions have been carried out (assessment of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer operates a business.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends. from the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In these cases, the customer must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID No. can be terminated at this time.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax payers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the VAT incurred thereon did not exceed the amount of €17,500 and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of €50,000 in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge other entrepreneurs VAT, nor to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they do not have to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs are forbidden to register with the tax office and submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small business owner may declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration shall be binding for the following five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">He may then charge the VAT and deduct the input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The prerequisite for this is that they exclusively carry out tax-free transactions and refrain from deducting input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The fiscal representative fulfils the tax reports of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for purposes of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices shall indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first condition for registration (among others) is the excess of the threshold amount mentioned in the VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="197">If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of registration for VAT, this tax code also applies to intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, a trader who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for domestic German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically assign a VAT ID number. apply.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both NKÚ and BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for both national registration for VAT and intra-Community transactions, could lead to serious misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-tier system allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not notify his business to the municipality or the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration permits a correct assessment of VAT for previous investment periods, in particular a precise estimate of the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">Since the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be harmonised.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.</seg>
<seg id="208">This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxes to every natural person after birth.</seg>
<seg id="209">This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person commences a business activity, the competent FA requests a commercial tax identification number, called VAT ID No. serves.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax payer and the allocation of VAT ID No. give.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on implementing an IT procedure for managing numbers has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">Cross-border passenger transport by bus and bus</seg>
<seg id="214">The legal regulations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">According to the regulations in §70 of the law No. 235/2004 the transportation is released since the 1st of May, 2004 from passengers between the single member states as well as between the member states and third countries in Czech Republic of the sales tax and there is claim to pretax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="216">The VAT exemption shall also apply where the transport of persons registered as taxpayers in other Member States or of foreigners who are taxpayers in their territory is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return journey is considered a separate transport operation.</seg>
<seg id="218">If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border carriage of passengers by coach, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as VAT eligible.</seg>
<seg id="219">Cross-border passenger transport has not been exempted from VAT in the Czech Republic under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The text of the point cited is worded as follows:</seg>
<seg id="220">'For the purposes of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EWG, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition laid down in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or until the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States. ';</seg>
<seg id="221">The legal regulations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EG of 28 November 2006, as transposed in Germany by Paragraph 3b (1) of the UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.</seg>
<seg id="223">Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxpayer transports through Germany, the part of the transport which is attributable to Germany is considered a taxpayer's transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="228">The latter registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each coach mentioned in the taxpayer's registration.</seg>
<seg id="229">The trader must state his tax-relevant transport services in a German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport service is provided to a domestic trader, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay VAT to the FA itself.</seg>
<seg id="232">In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services shall pay the turnover tax to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This transaction is referred to as the "deferral of liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EG.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the notification by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxpayer transport:</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile control groups of the customs check certificates of bus and coach registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each test, the mobile control groups shall submit an inspection report to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident taxpayer may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax liability indicated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the FA has doubts as to the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an examination to be carried out in the FA or may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Although the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally fixed turnover tax, the FA may 76/308/EWG request assistance under the Council Directive.</seg>
<seg id="240">The Federal Republic of Germany considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters for checking the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too costly in relation to the small volume of VAT on taxable passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the audit of the books of a non-resident tax payer causes disproportionate costs for the tax payer himself and for the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter must examine the foreign books, for which not only knowledge of the foreign language but also of the foreign accounting principles is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="243">Accordingly, such an audit is expected to involve a higher amount of time than a resident tax payer, although the examination is limited to the passenger transport operations that take place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must not only accept the auditing rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States in so far as he carries out passenger transport operations there.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, for each Member State where a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxpayer must comply with all existing fiscal reports in the different languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="246">This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation varies between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from turnover tax by virtue of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route falling within German territory.</seg>
<seg id="251">If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="252">This registers the taxpayer, who must declare the taxpayer's share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA have passenger transport as their business purpose.</seg>
<seg id="255">The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States which levy turnover tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EG of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should be taxable only in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the State in which the transport commences or in which the service provider is established.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EG of 28 November 2006.</seg>
<seg id="260">Sales tax explanations</seg>
<seg id="261">Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">Unless otherwise provided by the law, the entrepreneur, even if no tax liability has arisen, is forbidden to submit a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax liability is incurred upon expiry of the deadline for filing the VAT return. Exempt from this scheme is the VAT on imports of goods pursuant to Law No 235/2004. Here the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If, as a result, above-average deductible input taxes result in a refund entitlement, this amount shall be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of the determination of this input tax deduction, without the need for an application.</seg>
<seg id="265">The period shall not apply in cases where the financial officer initiates a tax procedure concerning the tax liability of the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="266">Pursuant to Paragraph 73 (11) of Law No 235/2004, the right to deduct VAT may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last taxation period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct VAT arose.</seg>
<seg id="267">At the end of that period, the deduction may be made within three years of the end of the taxation period during which the claim would have been possible for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this requires a supplementary tax return.</seg>
<seg id="269">An amendment to Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, permits the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been invoked for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">A taxpayer must file a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability; (b) he makes corrections which do not alter the most recently known tax liability; (c) he modifies only previous data in accordance with Section 49 of Law No 235/2004, corrections of the turnover liability.</seg>
<seg id="271">A tax payer may file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxpayer shall submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.</seg>
<seg id="273">The VAT return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or via data carriers.</seg>
<seg id="274">Delivery via the Internet can be done with or without a certified electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to a data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return form contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.</seg>
<seg id="277">The value of related services must be specified in separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered as taxable persons is compared with the data provided by the Czech taxpayers in their summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="280">The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from which they are registered as taxpayers is compared with the information given in the Summary Reports of taxpayers from other EC Member States using the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="281">Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA examines the credibility of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="282">This is done automatically, since the VAT return cannot be processed without the previous check.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility assessment includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an evaluation of the risks of the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">In accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 37 (1) of Law No 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary reports under this or a special tax law or decision under that law.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="286">In its examination, the NKÚ found that, in the event of non-submission of the VAT return, it was rarely used by the undertaking to impose a fine on the taxpayer concerned.</seg>
<seg id="287">Filing and processing of sales tax returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are forbidden to submit VAT pre-filings must nevertheless submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not liable to pay VAT must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="291">The taxpayers are generally forbidden to file a VAT advance declaration by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability in the previous year amounted to more than €6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is liable to make monthly VAT pre-filings no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer can also decide to submit monthly VAT pre-filings if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">If the annual VAT does not exceed €512, no VAT pre-registration or VAT returns shall be filed.</seg>
<seg id="295">A resulting VAT liability must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="296">A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no (statutory) deadlines for processing VAT returns and for reimbursement of VAT overpayments.</seg>
<seg id="298">To receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.</seg>
<seg id="299">In principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (tax or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">If granted, the pre-filing of VAT declarations and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment must be made.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment is offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-notification period of December.</seg>
<seg id="304">If an error is detected, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT advance declaration.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no "supplementary" VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">If the VAT return to be filed by 31 May of the following year is once filed with the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">At the end of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a reckless tax reduction or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Taxpayers must submit VAT pre-filings electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">They may grant exceptions to this rule to avoid unwanted hardships.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual VAT return can be submitted either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If the submission is made without certification, the tax payer must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">If no VAT pre-filings or declarations are submitted, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax controller 6.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of a delay, the tax payer may be charged a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to a sum of €25,000).</seg>
<seg id="315">In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the SGI often did not charge this late surcharge.</seg>
<seg id="316">In cases where the SE charged the late surcharges, the amount was fixed in a non-uniform and arbitrary manner.</seg>
<seg id="317">The late surcharge therefore fails to achieve its purpose of reducing the average delay, particularly when submitting the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The VAT return form contains separate lines for values relating to intra-Community deliveries or purchases.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions shall be reported in a separate line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="321">The VAT returns filed on paper must either be scanned or recorded electronically by dedicated personnel.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data of electronic tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="323">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="324">After all data have been collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a false selection is made on the basis of certain standards.</seg>
<seg id="325">The sales tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible specialist on the basis of the automatically created inspection instructions (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the tax payer's turnover, the taxation period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, taxpayers must file their pre-registrations at the latest 10 days after the end of either the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annual VAT return must be made no later than 31 May of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="332">There are some advantages and disadvantages to issuing an annual VAT return:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer may correct the errors in the monthly pre-declarations by submitting a single VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">- if the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM,</seg>
<seg id="335">- The Länder do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the annual VAT returns have normally been processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to the registration (see 4.1.3) German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This tax waiver enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the competent FA may reconcile the annual VAT return with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company concerned.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, the financial administration can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax payers are forfeited for the electronic filing of the VAT advance application.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the electronic filing of the tax return in the Czech Republic would increase the effectiveness of the Czech financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary messages</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">Pursuant to Paragraph 102 of Law No 235/2004, a trader supplying goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State shall submit summary declarations (hereinafter referred to as "the ZM").</seg>
<seg id="345">The value of the goods delivered shall always be indicated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down by USt-IdNr7, the individual taxpayers under which they are registered in the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="346">Information on services is not provided in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="347">The taxpayers with a calendar-monthly or a quarter-yearly tax period shall submit the ZM to the local FA no later than the 25th day following the end of each quarter.</seg>
<seg id="348">Incorrect data shall be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the detection of the error.</seg>
<seg id="349">Incorrect data in the ZM are always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly to tax returns, tax payers can also submit the ZM electronically.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a taxpayer does not surrender a ZM or correction ZM, even though he is forbidden to do so under Law No 235/2004, the financial officer shall ask him to surrender the ZM concerned, indicating the consequences of the non-levy. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary reports, the financial officer shall have the power to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Paragraph 37 of Law No 337/1992.</seg>
<seg id="352">In its examination, the NKÚ found that, in most cases, it did not use its power to impose fines on its defaulting taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, when the ZM is submitted, the tax payers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to surrender a ZM does not impair the amount of their VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">Pursuant to Paragraph 102 (5) of Law No 235/2004, the financial officer is forbidden to verify the information in the ZM or correction ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">If not matching</seg>
<seg id="356">8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxpayer corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting an adjustment ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.</seg>
<seg id="357">The financial officer shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">- the taxable person does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,</seg>
<seg id="359">- the financial officer has demonstrated that the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or correction ZM is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="360">Corrections entered by the tax official without a correction ZM being issued by the tax controller, do not replace the tax controller's reply to a correction ZM, but only result in the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from the ZM shall be forwarded to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of value added tax may transmit and receive this data.</seg>
<seg id="363">This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The "O_MCTL" message is automatically sent to the CLO from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect VAT IDNs specified in the submitted ZM rows.</seg>
<seg id="365">Becomes the incorrect VAT IDNr. in some of the transmitted rows of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of incorrect USt IDNr.</seg>
<seg id="366">The list contains a "Report of doubts regarding VAT ID No."</seg>
<seg id="367">The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the verification into the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxpayer must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return designated for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of differences between the values of the acquisitions made by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return and the values for the supply of goods indicated by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM are forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for verification.</seg>
<seg id="370">The specialists there must examine the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="371">Three different situations can then occur:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by the suppliers from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The difference amount is zero.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer in the meantime issues a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax official to check the accuracy of the data in the VAT return nonetheless.</seg>
<seg id="377">(c) the value of the goods purchased from other Member States which the Czech taxpayer stated in his VAT return is higher than the value of their deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here, in turn, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer shall enter the results of its review into ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">These results are forwarded to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of transactions sent by the CLO for audit can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 from Graphic No. 1 (Source: Czech Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="382">Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO decreased for each quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="383">The significant reduction in the number in the 4 quarter of 2005 is partly due to the fact that the Czech CLO raised the threshold for a false selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">Deviations between the data in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic purchaser.</seg>
<seg id="385">There may also be an error by the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of supplies in each Member State are indicated differently in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the audited ZF are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Traders who carry out intra-Community deliveries to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions from Germany must surrender ZM quarterly, in which intra-Community deliveries are listed by acquirer (§ 18a (1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="390">If a permanent extension is granted for the filing of the advance VAT declarations, this also applies to the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="391">The ZM must be submitted to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="393">The competent FA may allow exemptions for individual taxpayers in order to avoid unwanted hardships.</seg>
<seg id="394">If the person responsible for the tax determines that the ZM was incorrect, he is forbidden to submit a correction ZM within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">If the ZM is not surrendered, the CLO initiates a enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="396">This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty payment is set and - fixing the penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German tax code allows a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO) to be set, the CLO imposes penalty payments of €125, €250 and €500 in three stages.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, Paragraph 26a (1) (5) of the UStG stipulates that the tax payer acts irregularly if he deliberately or lightly does not surrender a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he does not correct a ZM or not in time.</seg>
<seg id="399">This infringement can be fined up to €5,000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the ZF because the CLO is solely responsible for processing the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="401">The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="402">The data from the Summary Messages are available only after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The time limits for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).</seg>
<seg id="405">In the case of incorrect VAT IDNr. the German CLO receives a notification "O_MCTL" from the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO then contacts the entrepreneur and requests the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then its task to request the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="409">In the course of its investigation, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs received the VAT IDNr. corrected at the request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, it takes too much time to remember and threaten and fix up to three consecutive penalty payments if a tax payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">The cases that were finally reported to the relevant ZF were usually closed within one to two mona-teens.</seg>
<seg id="412">The relevant FA refused the tax exemption for notified intra-Community deliveries in 73% of those offsets9.</seg>
<seg id="413">Put the correct VAT ID No. , the FA requested him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO because the CI cannot correct the MIAS data itself.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the CN nor the CLO controlled the levy of the corrected CM.</seg>
<seg id="415">Therefore, the tax payers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information provided in the VAT pre-declarations or the VAT return with the corresponding information in the ZM before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This reconciliation can only be carried out by the ZF. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT check.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT IDNr. are identified and reported to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data will be used to control the tax on labour market taxation in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once available in the system, it matches the CLO with previous calendar quarter data.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications shall be drawn up and transmitted to the competent ENTITY.</seg>
<seg id="422">This is done continuously, whereas an audit of the acquisition data of all VAT holders is later prepared and forwarded to the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="423">The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares these data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">The system fully verifies (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must submit a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="427">The ZF process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the taxpayers in the ZM shall be compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same taxpayers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are taken into account in the context of the tax determination.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, taxpayers who have carried out intra-Community deliveries are packaged to deliver quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.</seg>
<seg id="431">Since 1 January 2007, tax controllers have to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="432">The data from the ZM are only available to the CLO after their processing.</seg>
<seg id="433">Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the tax payers in the ZM indicate only the deliveries of goods.</seg>
<seg id="434">The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. In contrast to the Czech Central Bank, the German Central Bank cannot correct incorrect data in individual lines of the issued ZM itself.</seg>
<seg id="435">Due to this restricted access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT IDNr. not corrected even if the controller has the correct VAT ID number. to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German taxpayers in their pre-filing of VAT with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the pre-notification data and the ZM are not regularly uncovered before the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">On the basis of these findings by the BRH, it is apparent that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="439">The data on deliveries of goods to Czech taxpayers transmitted by other Member States shall be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods indicated by the Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The Czech CLO adjusts separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most serious cases of deviations will be sent to the ZF for verification.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general check is only carried out on taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="444">Furthermore, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax payers only if the RMS has drawn up an audit notice or the tax payer has already been selected for an audit.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the U.S. from clarifying the reasons for any differences that occur.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">To combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax payers had to surrender monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly levy would increase the bureaucratic expense only insignificantly, since most tax payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already forfeited for filing monthly VAT returns or pre-filings and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or pre-filings.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid red tape, the submission of the ZM could be linked to the submission of VAT returns or pre-filings.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, a lack of monthly distribution of ZM would create more periodic discrepancies between intra-Community supply data and intra-Community acquisition data and increase data flows between CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="454">The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">These feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">It is necessary to agree on the monthly monthly levy at European level so that monthly updating of the MIAS data is possible in order to be able to demonstrate the impact of the levy on the monthly ZM levy.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on deliveries of goods and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total turnover of intra-Community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both invoices requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID number. in the O_MCTL-Meldungen exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter audited.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data can be found in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">They have significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL-Meldungen.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O_MCTLMeldung entered.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information at level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">International exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxpayers who have carried them out.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of value added tax, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information and the exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request shall be carried out by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standardised SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="470">Financial officials in the Czech Republic shall send their RFIs or replies to an RFI received by the Financial Directorate to the CLO. This concerns the translation into the foreign language of the information provided in the standardised SCAC form and the transmission to the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also receives requests for information (RFIs) from other Member States and responses to requests sent. It takes care of their translation into Czech and their distribution to the responsible ZF for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 lays down a period not exceeding three months from receipt of the request for its processing.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period under review were examined by NKÚ.</seg>
<seg id="474">From the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NKÚ examination. More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Graphic 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">From the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%), a reply was received within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53,4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases no reply from Germany had been received at the time of the NKÚ examination (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to determine when Germany replied to the request for information on the basis of the stated information).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany have been answered can be found in Graphic No 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of intra-Community transactions indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Graphic No 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values of over €60,000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Financial officials in other Member States are often provided with information without prior request which is important for determining the value added tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">Exchanges of information between Member States are carried out electronically.</seg>
<seg id="484">"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-determined information to other Member States at regular pre-determined intervals without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="485">"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of pre-determined information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States of new vehicle deliveries by automatic exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="487">The financial officer receives this information from the form of notification concerning the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of Law No. 235/2004 as well as from the copy of the issued invoice.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data into the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, these data shall be transmitted to the other Member States within the prescribed period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Czech Republic shall also provide the other Member States with information on transactions in transit which are tax-free in the country of origin on intra-Community transactions which appear to be inadmissible and on potential "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="490">This information shall be transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in the spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.</seg>
<seg id="493">They will send the completed SCAC 2004 form directly by e-mail to the German CLO, which will forward the SCACV prints to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">They are required to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACVordruck used is one-piece.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure tax on acquisition in the other Member State or to demonstrate the tax exemption of intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO concerns the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are not written in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">In order to respond to the request for information, the CLO directs it to the competent FA, referring to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">No further deadlines are set at the various levels of the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor the keeping of the deadline, it does not have the necessary human resources to remind it of the reply to the unfinished requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">They receive the required information by writing to the tax controller or conducting an external audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the VAT special audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months or the so-called VAT review, which may relate only to a recent transaction.</seg>
<seg id="504">With this short and transparent form of audit, an announcement to the tax payer is not necessary and it has proven itself in the investigation of a single turnover.</seg>
<seg id="505">When exchanging information automatically, Germany shall provide the other Member State with the following information: - on VAT ID No., allocated to undertakings established in other EC Member States - on the refund of input tax to traders established in other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has refused to communicate the following information to the other Member States within the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. The supply of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant differences between the acquisitions reported by a taxpayer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States; intra-Community supplies of goods incorrectly taxed in Germany by the taxpayer; potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their UStIdNr. is still valid or has already been deleted as well as tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have received a VAT ID number. misused.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">Requests for information or spontaneous information shall be sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the locally responsible ZF, who shall transmit the corresponding SCACV prints to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACV prints (Czech-English) and translates information provided into English or German, the German SCACV follows the instructions to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration handled 74,5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information sent to Germany were dealt with by the German financial administration only in 40,6% of the cases within that period.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO points out the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.</seg>
<seg id="514">Due to the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of requests for information answered on time.</seg>
<seg id="515">This is why the Federal Republic of Germany has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has now changed.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices of the reply to the outstanding requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">Sales tax-risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the field of sales tax.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organizational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of VAT or its Unit for Risk Management is concerned with identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluating trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.</seg>
<seg id="523">At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk products, conceptually prepares risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates in this field with the competent EC bodies and the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Division for International Assistance in the Field of Turnover Tax shall, inter alia, exchange information, assist in the creation and implementation of a relevant information database, evaluate the data available in the MIAS system of other Member States, provide public information and be responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>

<seg id="529">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="530">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="531">The Department of Methodology for Tax Auditing and Tax Investigation conducts, among other things, risk analyses in the context of the methodological control of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be audited; prepare risk analyses to combat tax evasion and collect information from the financial administration and other sources in this context and propose measures to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Tax investigation offices exist at the financial directorates. Their tasks include searching for tax payers and industries that are at risk of hiding tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searching for unregistered tax payers (e.g. Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="533">Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected units.</seg>
<seg id="534">These have regional jurisdiction and carry out tax audits outside the local jurisdiction of the European Union on the basis of appropriate authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up the special audit units stemmed from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.</seg>
<seg id="536">These special units check according to the needs of the tax authorities or focus on tax payers with certain activities, multinational companies and tax payers with particularly high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for reducing VAT risks have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk-bearing nature of tax returns issued, - the task of "selection of taxpayers to be audited," with the taxpayers to be audited being selected on the basis of certain criteria, - the task of "MIAS," which allows fiscal officials access to the data provided by other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The task "MIAS" makes it possible to: - Check the validity of the VAT ID number. taxpayers from other Member States - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxpayer, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the tax controller concerned from other Member States; - drawing up a list of taxpayers who have not submitted ZMs, - formal control of the information provided by taxpayers in the Czech Republic in their ZM, before such information is transmitted to other Member States - drawing up a list of taxpayers, in whose VAT returns the information relating to deliveries of goods to other Member States does not correspond to the information in the ZM; - draw up a list of taxpayers in whose VAT returns the information on the value of goods purchased from other Member States is inconsistent with the information in the ZM of all their suppliers from other Member States13.</seg>
<seg id="539">In the context of their responsibilities to combat tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from state authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, trade registers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Submission and Processing of Summary Reports in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to its federal structure, the Federal Chancellery authorities (especially the CLO) as well as the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the Länder have a uniform data set.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the CLO, the unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - Coordination Centre for Special VAT Audits and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the findings of fraud audits in the OPUS database.</seg>
<seg id="545">In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or VAT cheaters.</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experiences of KUSS are introduced into the development of the RMS through their cooperation in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, experts from several other CLO and BMF organizational units are also involved.</seg>
<seg id="549">The formal verification of the composition of UStIdNr. other Member States appearing in the ZM of German taxpayers shall be implemented by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal review takes place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and therefore its benefits (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The validity check in the ZM-named VAT IDNr. is based on the O_MCTL-Kennungen provided by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the CLO's RMS relies on MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of communications to detect suspected missing traders. Certain features are used as indications, which usually occur in carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="553">The Federal States of Germany are instructed to process these communications and must forward the outcome of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.</seg>
<seg id="554">The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).</seg>
<seg id="555">Accordingly, the Federal Republic of Germany has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different indications in the preparation of the messages.</seg>
<seg id="556">The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the payment behaviour of the taxpayer, the industry or the company's shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the system produces a list of those tax payers who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-registration or annual declaration.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete delivery of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, in the case of this type of risk management, the acquisitions indicated by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="561">The financial administrations of the Länder avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as these would result in too many inconsistencies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="562">- suppliers and purchasers assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community turnover,</seg>
<seg id="563">- different accounting records and tax returns of discounts and discounts.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing the data from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company word skin, age of holders/shareholders, number of employees and payment method).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a fixed-rule risk management system that allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way as to eliminate suspected tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="566">This system is used when processing VAT applications.</seg>
<seg id="567">As a result, the competent FA receives the information from the RMS before the VAT is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers must adjust the rules according to the feedback from the ZF.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of uncovered evasion cases.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The system shall draw up a monthly list of tax cases where there are indications of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list, the competent tax authorities shall decide on the audit of the tax beneficiaries concerned.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, the auditors must report their findings so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests it proposes.</seg>
<seg id="574">In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on many data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called datamining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax payer is involved in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">After that, it compiles a monthly list of suspected tax cheaters.</seg>
<seg id="577">Based on this list, they select the relevant tax controllers for verification and report the verification results to the relevant data center.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud schemes appears to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will arise during actual use.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although it is not possible in this report to address the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Like the different approaches in the three German Länder mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - has not been a national but a European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">The persons involved in fraud shall coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.</seg>
<seg id="587">A Member State alone cannot develop effective RMS.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this is not done, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their offences.</seg>
<seg id="589">The loss of VAT caused by European fraud does not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">There should therefore be a European exchange of experience on RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected results from the audit of individual sales During the parallel audits, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or</seg>
<seg id="593">Acquisitions which have been the subject of an international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two jurisdictions jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, which had doubts about the implementation of which, or which the tax authorities of both States declared differently in the tax returns or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, in 43 cases the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany on the basis of communications from the BRH, which Czech taxpayers had indicated in their tax returns and ZM.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="598">The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to MIAS data, a Czech tax payer acquired €60,500 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech tax authority declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech financial administration sent Germany a request for information to verify the value of the delivered goods.</seg>
<seg id="603">In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German taxpayer in question stated that the Czech counterparty had delivered goods worth €27,381 in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="604">Further, the answer was that the VAT IDNr. the German taxpayer was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further request by the German taxpayer and the validity of the VAT IDNr. with retroactive effect from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German tax payer corrected the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="606">This information constituted a (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="607">By asking the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted supplementary VAT returns in 2004 for the individual (underage) tax periods during which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time the deduction of input tax from purchases from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent person in charge of the Czech tax office was not able to clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above mentioned purchases was also included in the declared purchases. German suppliers were included.</seg>
<seg id="609">In reply to a request for information from NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as liable for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only for a tax number valid for Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is usually not possible in Germany, a tax payer retroactively receives a VAT ID number. In 2006, the responsible person in charge of the German financial administration did so retroactively with effect from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO shares a VAT IDNr. retroactively if the dear entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO receives the delay following the request of the tax controller for the issuance of a VAT ID number. caused.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO issues the VAT IDNr. retroactive, because the entrepreneur according to § 6 UStG for an intra-Community delivery no valid VAT ID no. needs.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number. its supplier to declare the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these procedural differences between Member States, the German CLO granted VAT IDNr. retroactive in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="618">The MIAS data give the date of registration of 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the German local FA indicates 1 October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">The German authorities replied that the German tax payer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but did not have a VAT ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005 for organisational reasons. assigned.</seg>
<seg id="620">The NKÚ received a request from the local Czech finance official that the financial officer had carried out a VAT check on the Czech tax inspector for the taxation periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">In that examination, the Finanzamt found that the Czech taxpayer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German taxpayer prior to its VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">The (Czech) tax office set a tax liability of CZK 1,880 against the Czech tax payer for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="623">In response to the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had the VAT IDNr. had been allocated only when he notified his company, founded in 2004, to the FA on 16 February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="624">Furthermore, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for the purposes of VAT in order to be able to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this VAT return, the tax-payable intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic amounted to €160 (approximately CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In its VAT return for September 2004 and in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer reported shipments of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="627">When checking the registration of the German tax payer in the MIAS system, the Czech financial official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the deliveries of goods to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech taxpayer issued a supplementary VAT return declaring sales from domestic supplies worth CZK 114,615 and VAT of CZK 21,777, which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">By asking the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently applied for a reopening of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German financial administration that the German tax payer had been registered since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Accordingly, the Czech financial official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax payer in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">The German information showed that the German tax payer did not receive a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods. had been allocated.</seg>
<seg id="632">As a result, the Czech financial official rejected the request to resume the taxation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place because the German taxpayer did not have a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004. had received.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the turnover tax and also demanded the refund of input taxes of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">Since this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German taxpayer mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German tax officer also confused the Czech financial officer.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German finance official reviewed the acquisition of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax payer from a German tax payer worth €22,686.</seg>
<seg id="640">By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had examined in the context of an external audit of the Czech tax inspector whether the intra-Community supply had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax inspector had paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return because the German supplier did not enter his VAT ID number in the invoice. but only indicated its tax code for transactions within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">According to the MIAS data, the German tax payer is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech financial official also requested that the German financial administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxpayer so that he could, if necessary, initiate a corresponding tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose VAT on the acquisition of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH found that, under German law, a tax payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have a VAT ID No. for intra-Community deliveries in order to benefit from the VAT exemption for such deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier only needs the UStIdNr. the purchaser in the other Member State and can demonstrate the transport of the goods concerned to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">In this case, under German tax law, turnover is an intra-Community (tax exempt) supply which should be subject to acquisition tax in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this business transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount limit of €15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to MIAS data, a Czech tax payer acquired €12,561 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech financial officer carried out an audit for this period of taxation.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the context of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this supply of goods by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech taxpayer stated that he had not received the product, had never been in business contact with the German company and that the purchase of the products in question had not been booked by him.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification was given.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documentation for subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was unsuccessful and the original tax determination was in place.</seg>
<seg id="656">Following a question from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German tax payer acted as "Fiskalvertreter17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German tax officer explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to tax exemption has been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of the communication by the Federal Republic of Germany, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">Section 4.6.1 shows that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month deadline more than the responses of the Czech financial administration:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. In its audit, NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech Financial Administration submitted to Germany a request for information on the value of WA deliveries made in the 4 quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax payer had reported a supply of goods to the Czech tax payer worth €86,307; however, the Czech taxpayer declared only the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Since the German financial administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, a Czech financial official requested a SCAC form to verify the delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, indicating carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The NKÚ found that a German response to the request for information had not yet been received at the time of its examination.</seg>
<seg id="667">By means of a request to the local financial officer, NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not declared in his VAT return the supply of new motor vehicles to these German tax payers worth CZK 11,816,103.</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech financial officer corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax officer issued a corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="669">Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following notification by the Federal Republic of Germany, a special VAT audit was carried out by the German acquirer in Germany. It was found that the acquisition of all the motor vehicles concerned had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were resold to other taxpayers in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax payer acquired a car worth € 4 from a German tax payer in the 2004 quarter of 48.500.</seg>
<seg id="672">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="673">By asking the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Czech tax officer did not issue any tax returns even after being asked by the financial official. Consequently, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT debt at zero for the period October to December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the said supply from the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above delivery to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the reply to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the NKÚ examination was completed how the Czech financial official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="678">Due to non-compliance with the Czech VAT law, the VAT registration of the Czech tax payer was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only one partial reply was sent because, at the time the NKÚ and the BRH were examined, the competent FA had not yet completed the external audit:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech Financial Officer requested a SCAC form to verify the delivery of motor vehicles in the third quarter of 2004 to a German tax payer worth €16,991, indicating carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In his reply to the request for information, the German finance official stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech tax inspector for deliveries worth €16,335.</seg>
<seg id="683">In response to the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed with the acquirer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 double in its pre-registration VAT for August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, a Czech financial official requested a SCAC form to verify the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, indicating carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German Financial Administration submitted a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic confirming that the German taxpayer had acquired several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits on the Czech taxpayer in order to verify the deduction of higher than average pre-taxes.</seg>
<seg id="688">However, an unauthorized claim has not been established.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared the acquisition of goods from other Member States for a total value of €579,114 in his VAT returns for the period in question and that the examination of the German FA has not yet been completed at the time of acquisition in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="690">Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the intra-Community acquisitions declaration in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.</seg>
<seg id="691">In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistencies or the incorrect declaration of turnover as intra-Community supply of goods were not the most valid reasons for the differences:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to data from MIAS, the Czech tax payer acquired €35,716 worth of goods from the German tax payer in the first quarter of 2005; however, the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the financial officer and no business was carried out at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech financial official requested a review of how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech government in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="695">The German reply to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech tax payer was unknown at the address indicated and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarding agent.</seg>
<seg id="696">The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax payer only supplied goods worth €21,659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech tax payer sent the German tax payer an incorrect payment confirmation for the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After detecting the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax payer succeeded in recovering the delivered material with the support of his other Czech customers, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.</seg>
<seg id="699">By means of a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received, the financial administration subsequently carried out the turnover taxation of goods delivered from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.</seg>
<seg id="700">Following a request from the NKÚ, the Federal Republic of Germany confirmed that the German supplier had only reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax payer worth €7,916 after corrections.</seg>
<seg id="701">In accordance with German legislation, the German tax authority declared the reversal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.</seg>
<seg id="702">His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech taxpayers:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">As part of the international exchange of information, the German Financial Administration requested a SCAC print to verify the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxpayer with goods with a total value of €396,126 and provided services with a value of €11,885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The NKÚ found that the Czech Financial Administration had carried out an audit with the Czech taxpayer in order to investigate this supply.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the request for information, the Czech Financial Administration stated that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and assembled a production facility for the German.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German taxpayer did not remove the assembled production plant and claimed deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax authority calculated the German production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German tax officer received the calculations, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">By asking the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices in the books of the Czech tax payer had been duly recorded.</seg>
<seg id="713">The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax collector and related to invoices invoiced after the first May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH found that the local FA concluded, on the basis of the reply of the Czech Financial Administration, that these transactions were a single (goods) supply of the Czech tax payer to the German, including the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called plant delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German recipient of the works is liable for VAT in accordance with the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient may claim a deduction in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As the German tax payer's liability for turnover remained unchanged, the German FA did not initiate any adjustment to the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to the MIAS data, in February 2005 the Czech tax payer A acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax payer C.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech finance official sent a request for verification of this information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer C had delivered that machine to Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that it had returned it to German taxpayer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany but to the subsidiary of the German tax regulator C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">The reply to the request for information also showed that German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">This received the machine at the registered office of the German tax officer in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no internal supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">The NKÚ found that according to the MIAS data, the German tax payer C had supplied the Czech tax payer goods (another machine) worth €88,027 in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">Taxpayer B stated that it had not received this product and that the Czech tax official responsible for the local authorities had sent a request for information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">The answer was that the machine had been delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">In the course of further investigations at taxpayer B, the tax official found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been booked to taxpayer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the German taxpayer C's subsidiary had delivered to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The NKÚ also found that the Czech tax official responsible for tax taxpayer A had carried out an audit of the latter.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax official had the account of the German taxpayer C of 7 February 2005, in which the taxpayer A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech financial official found that tax payer A had not posted this invoice.</seg>
<seg id="733">Taxpayer A had entered into a lease agreement with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also provided transport.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of taxpayer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH found that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine worth €88,027 not to the Czech Republic but to another German tax payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">Accordingly, there was no intra-Community supply of goods, but a tax-payable supply within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the German tax liability C's claim to VAT exemption and corrected the information in its tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German tax controller D delivered the machine to the Czech tax controller B.</seg>
<seg id="740">Under German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">The BRH also found that German tax payer C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to Czech tax payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not verified during the tax examination carried out by the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following figure shows the contractual relationships between the counterparties involved in the above transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">When examining requests for information received, NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005, the Czech Financial Administration received a request for information from Germany in which a German financial official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">The German finance official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a positive intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The German taxpayer had not been active since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had carried out an external audit of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="749">The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a German tax payer's claim to the German financial administration, which the Czech tax payer claimed as a shareholder in the German company at the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech financial official has so far no information that the German financial administration is handling the case with reference to the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="751">It follows from the available information that this was not a delivery of goods; Nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community supply of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for these inconsistencies was the failure to state the intra-Community acquisition in recipients' tax returns (see section 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer delivered a total value of €33,205 to a Czech tax payer in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="754">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="755">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="756">In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the other goods had been collected personally.</seg>
<seg id="757">By asking the Czech official responsible for local operations, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="758">Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech financial official recommended a tax check with the Czech tax inspector.</seg>
<seg id="759">This test has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer had delivered €46,854 to a Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only €14,856.</seg>
<seg id="762">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for a review of the actual value of the supply.</seg>
<seg id="763">The German reply to this request sent three invoices showing a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="764">By asking the Czech financial officer responsible for local matters, NKÚ found that, after receiving the reply from Germany, the latter had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax inspector and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the owner about submitting a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">No additional VAT return has been filed so far.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech finance official informed NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retroactive VAT fixing for the tax period in question were respected.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax payer delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="769">In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official requested a check as to whether the Czech taxpayer in question actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer had established a number of hypocrites in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">As part of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">However, according to the Czech tax authority, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech taxpayer provided supporting documents for the sale in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech taxpayer was not registered in Germany as liable to VAT and had not taxed the sale of the product in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech financial official provided this information in his reply to the request for information to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="775">The NKÚ stated by inquiry to the Czech Financial Officer responsible for the local area: that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of a tax audit; in which he declared inter alia the value of the goods which he had acquired from a German taxpayer and at the same time claimed the right of deduction for acquisition from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="777">On the basis of a supplementary VAT return issued after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to Czech legislation, in this case there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, since the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">As a result, the Czech financial officer has drawn a false conclusion during the external audit.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German finance official corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded the payment of turnover tax worth €1,600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent FA sent a control communication to the FA responsible for the actual consignee of the product in order to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech finance official received a request for information from the German financial administration on whether the Czech tax payer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The request for information was accompanied by an attachment to the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="786">As a further installation, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="787">In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person mentioned therein had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and that he had no contact with a German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="789">With this information, the Czech financial official replied to the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.</seg>
<seg id="790">By inquiry with the Czech Financial Officer responsible for the location, the NKÚ determined that the Czech tax payer is not based at the address indicated in the Commercial Register and that the Managing Director of the company is not accessible.</seg>
<seg id="791">Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period February 2005, the Czech financial official set the Czech tax liability at zero.</seg>
<seg id="792">In the course of a further investigation, the Czech financial official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had acquired it on the basis of an Internet ad.</seg>
<seg id="793">The BRH found that the local German finance official had refused the German taxpayer's right to exempt that supply from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="795">A Czech tax payer should have delivered €89,424 worth of goods to a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In its reply to the request for information, the Czech finance official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the product was allegedly a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech taxpayer issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorised person, that shareholder of the company, following the cancellation of the managing director in the commercial register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech tax authority informed the financial officer that the capital owner had paid the payment received for the invoiced goods in euro into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash receipts were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">By inquiry to the Czech local FA, the NKÚ found that the financial officer had recognised the Czech taxpayer's entitlement to VAT exemption for goods shipments to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the German acquirer's VAT return, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="804">In the absence of any evidence of tax fraud from the previous external review, there is no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer acquired €4,251,196 worth of goods from the Czech Republic in 2005, according to which he had acquired goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in either its VAT return in 2004 or 2005.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, it did not declare value-related initial sales.</seg>
<seg id="808">Due to these inconsistencies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the 4 quarter of 2005 and the 1 quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods totalling CZK 167,246,083.</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received in which the German side requested that it be examined whether the supply notified by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this request for information, the Czech Financial Administration stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company had no managing director (or other legal representative).</seg>
<seg id="812">It can be seen from the documents provided to NKÚ by the responsible financial officer that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax officer, a protocol had been drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the start of the VAT audit for the 4 quarter 2004 and the period January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">The tax officer was simultaneously asked by the tax official to provide all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the only Managing Director's term of office expired on 16 May 2005 without a new Managing Director being appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech taxpayer has not submitted sales tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="816">In the context of the parallel examination, NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two Court of Auditors exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct tax-relevant transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005 but did not receive a German VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) to manufacture wind turbines and supply them to Austria on behalf, on the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to insufficient production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German tax payer (UDE) in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:</seg>
<seg id="824">- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.</seg>
<seg id="825">Due to the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the supply of wind turbines is controllable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">- Because the freight forwarder was contracted by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in his own name, at his own risk and on his own account, the place of delivery of the German subcontractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in one EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the supply of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the supply was intended was another Czech State.</seg>
<seg id="828">Accordingly, the supply is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.</seg>
<seg id="830">However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">- The supply of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">- The supply of the other wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community supplies either in its German tax returns or in its ZM submitted to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">Consequently, the Czech company may have uniformly treated all its intra-Community supplies as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria but reported intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">In order to ensure taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although in this case there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case-by-case scenarios to show the magnitude of the differences between the data in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The cases examined also show that it will take some time for the tax payers to apply the new statutory provisions:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax payer reported shipments of goods totalling CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-Community deliveries to another German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.</seg>
<seg id="842">From the information provided by BRH to NKÚ, it was found that both were supplies of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above-mentioned supplies in their ZM according to Czech Law No 235/2004 in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">In a further examination of these business transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 different statutory regulations on the supply and purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany were in force.</seg>
<seg id="845">Whilst in the Czech Republic the taxpayers are responsible for deliveries of electrical energy in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 declared as intra-Community deliveries of goods, the German statutory provisions in force in 2004 do not constitute an intra-Community acquisition of goods but are taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The differences in legislation were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635/2004, which amended certain tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. When examining intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that: that, for the first and fourth quarters of the year, a Czech taxpayer 2005 intra-Community deliveries to a German taxpayer with a total value of 240.411.163 CZK and another Czech taxpayer with an intra-Community supply to another German taxpayer with a value of 263.470.776</seg>
<seg id="848">Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases it was a supply of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">In accordance with the wording of Law No 235/2004, applicable from 1 January 2005, where electrical energy is supplied, the place of performance shall be that at which the purchaser has its legal seat, place of business or place of business for which the supply is made.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have indicated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electricity in their ZM as intra-Community supplies resulted in an amount difference of CZK 503.881.939 in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="852">Concluding remark</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation achieved the goals of the BRH and the NKÚ.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both audit offices gained in-depth knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation disclosed differences in the two systems and in the statutory provisions governing the VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions occurred.</seg>
<seg id="857">For some of them, another observation is worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit results, both Court of Auditors produced recommendations for the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="859">Follow-up of these recommendations in the form of an audit should be part of the follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both Court of Auditors is the basis for the successful execution of future VAT management audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Court of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and Overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance to both the State and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The State's task is to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to ensure that competition is largely unrestricted, contracting authorities have to comply with EU requirements in their procurement procedures, starting from certain value limits (thresholds).</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, EU Member States have to transfer and apply EU public procurement law into national law.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Below the EU thresholds, individual countries are left to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The award of services is also a corrupt area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In view of the high potential for damage in principle, contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and inadmissible benefits in the award of their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Court of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits both for the EU-wide award of construction services and for corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="14">The examinations focused on the application of the EU procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as on preventing corruption in the award of construction services in construction and road construction or transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">The award below the EU thresholds was also included in the considerations with regard to corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit results of both Court of Auditors are summarized in this Joint Report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="18">Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Court on the topics listed are mainly based on cross-sectional audits carried out in 2011/2012 by the building administrations responsible for the Federal Government's road and building construction in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, he examined the construction of motorways and large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the Bundesrechnungshof used results from previous investigations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction work in road construction, rail, water construction, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other other construction areas in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the public contracts awarded by the Federal Government are predominantly carried out by the construction administrations of the Federal States.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the public works administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the field of construction, the allocations are carried out decentrally by those bodies which use government budgetary resources.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, freelancers are also involved for sub-sectors of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="26">When comparing the evaluations, account should be taken of differences in the procurement law and the market structure for construction services of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Development of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is defined in laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to the national sector shall be governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions based thereon.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, for both EU-wide and national procurement, many complementary individual schemes are provided by internal administrative provisions,</seg>
<seg id="31">such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the statutory requirements are supplemented or elaborated in more detail in accordance with the law on procurement.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other statutory provisions applicable both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new regime increased transparency in the use of public funds, increased competition and limited the possibilities for corruption in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Broad principles of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure must be applied in particular for EU-wide contracts.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold apply the national types of procurement (Public Tender, Restricted Tender, Freehand Procurement), which correspond to the above-mentioned EU-wide types of procurement.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for EU-wide procurement) and the public tender (for national procurement).</seg>
<seg id="39">In the open procedure and in the public tender procedure, any interested undertaking may submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is mainly done by dividing a total construction measure into specialist and partial lots.</seg>
<seg id="42">The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.</seg>
<seg id="44">In Germany, more than 330,000 construction companies employ 1.9 million people.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures also apply to construction projects below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">An exception is the simplified procedure in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with EU law, Czech public procurement law contains provisions whereby contracts are to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="48">Current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow contracting entities to choose between the open procedure and the restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Czech Republic there are over 85,000 construction companies, of which about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of types of procurement in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In Germany, the total construction volume in the year amounted to 2011,307 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of this amount, EUR 45.5 billion was allocated to public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The construction volume of the federal government in the field of construction and highway construction (excluding railways and water engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="54">The volume of contracts for construction works in the construction and highway construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders and 6.6% negotiated procedures and free-handed tenders.</seg>
<seg id="55">Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, representing 37% of the total construction volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Breakdown by type of procurement for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% Negotiated procedures 8.4% Simplified procedures for volumes below the threshold 2.7% Other procedures</seg>
<seg id="59">The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public contracting entities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The above mentioned Data show that the parallel audits carried out by both countries are directed towards a significant proportion of public procurement, the prevention of corruption to be observed in all contracts is of great financial importance and the open procedure and the public tender are of outstanding importance in the award of the contracts.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the results of the parallel tests</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Court of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide allocation of construction services and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="63">In this context, the working groups of both Court of Auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the fields of construction and road construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">In essence, they found:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (n. 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the EU requirements, corruption prevention is also served by the procurement arrangements of both countries, some of which differ in their priorities and in their detail (point 3.2).</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, an essential requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information necessary for the proper submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not have any competition restrictive specifications.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, it remains a problem to determine the subject-matter of the contract sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, construction services are to be divided as far as possible into lots in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">Following the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">In its audits, the NKÚ found, in particular in the field of road construction, that the award of substantial services without lots or with only very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Market potential constraints can lead to significant cost increases and risk price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">In accordance with the provisions of both countries, contracting entities may, under certain conditions, agree, in principle, with the companies already contracted, additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective specifications for determining the type of award were mainly followed in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting entities can choose freely between open and non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary precedence of the open procedure applies to EU-wide contracts or public tenders which correspond to the open procedure for national contracts.</seg>
<seg id="79">This allows more companies to submit offers.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price agreements between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations generally awarded construction services throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct estimation of the estimated contract value is an essential basis for the selection of the correct type of procurement.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, cost databases are used for the determination of costs for public buildings, in particular in building construction,</seg>
<seg id="84">which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but this is not yet an effective instrument (point 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">For construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and notices must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to adapt to the proposed contracts at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="87">The audited building administrations generally adhered to this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (point 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to the EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries should switch among the companies to be requested as often as possible when selecting candidates.</seg>
<seg id="93">In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited administrations disregarded these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (point 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, it is necessary to ensure that the companies interested in submitting tenders receive the same information during the tendering phase in order to ensure equal competition.</seg>
<seg id="97">Contact between these companies and freelancers involved in the preparation of the SOW shall be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">The audited construction administrations in Germany partly did not comply with these requirements (point 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In opening up tenders, particular attention should be paid to the multi-eye principle and the transparency principle in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="101">The specifications for marking, documentation, storage and confidentiality of the offers are intended to narrow down the scope for manipulation and are defined in Germany in particular in detail.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tests in both countries revealed few complaints (point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Auditing and evaluation of tenders are defined in both countries by specifications for organising the structure and process.</seg>
<seg id="104">The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting entities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting entities handed over tenders to third parties for examination without first looking through the tenders and sufficiently documenting abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="106">The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">When the EU-wide procurement procedures are concluded, the companies participating in the competition are to be informed of the intended procurement before award.</seg>
<seg id="108">This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="109">The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in a few cases did the contracting entities not comply with the prescribed deadlines for awarding contracts or deviate from the tenderers' offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible by the audited construction administrations in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the awarding notes of some procedures.</seg>
<seg id="113">Some of the deficiencies detected also undermined the anti-corruption function of the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">The contracting authorities of both countries have largely fulfilled their reporting and reporting obligations (point 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Foundations of EU procurement law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">EU-assignment right</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure unlimited competition within the European Union with free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted inter alia the procurement coordination and appeal directives, which were to be transposed into national law by the Member States8.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general principles of European Union procurement are, in particular, that of competition, equal treatment or non-discrimination and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive contains specific rules for construction work on construction projects to be awarded throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="120">For this purpose, their expected order totals must currently reach or exceed EUR 5,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="121">The rules relate in particular to the content of the procurement documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the adherence to deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the procurement procedure, the requirements which may be imposed on the qualification of candidates and The Appeals Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of possible infringements of procurement law, undertakings concerned may have the decisions of contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.</seg>
<seg id="124">Corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="125">The importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">In both countries there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for the private benefit,</seg>
<seg id="128">the i.d.R. the beneficiaries of those decisions.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">In the area of the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may jeopardise confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">In doing so, they have to check the establishment and draining organisation of their administrations for areas particularly at risk of corruption in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.</seg>
<seg id="135">Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making to corrupt abuse.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corrupt area of work.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery as well as acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="139">In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on corruption preventation12 in the Federal Administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles must be taken into account for the procurement sector: priority of public procurement and open procedures, multi-eye principle and transparency, basic separation of planning, award and billing, accurate and complete documentation of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, further anti-corruption requirements have been included in the procurement rules.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the Federal Ministry of Public Procurement in the Field of Long-Distance Roads introduced an electronically based control system.</seg>
<seg id="142">with the procurement data - such as the estimated costs and the order sums - as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected and evaluated for abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="143">Corruption is also prosecuted in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="144">The statutory requirements for transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, constitute the most important basis for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">For public procurement, the Czech government has adopted anti-corruption measures in a anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of the measures it recommends have already been transposed into national procurement law and related administrative regulation14.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation essentially includes the following provisions: lowering the thresholds for smaller orders, the obligation to publish contracts in advance by the contracting authority, including the reasons for the invitation to tender; prohibition of restriction of the number of tenderers in restricted procedures, thereby eliminating the possibility of selection of tenderers through batch procedures, the introduction of the obligation to publish the procurement documents and all Annexes; Introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and list of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Test results for the individual stages of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Assignment documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Procurement documents The procurement documents must contain all the information that tenderers need for a proper tender.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the procurement documents must enable a correct calculation.</seg>
<seg id="152">Bidders must not be given risks that cannot be calculated for them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The procurement documents consist in particular of the SOW and the contract conditions.</seg>
<seg id="154">In addition, they contain the requirements for proof of the qualification (suitability) of the tenderers as well as the criteria which are decisive for the selection of the most economical tender.</seg>
<seg id="155">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="156">The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are addressed in particular to the technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="157">These must be equally accessible to all tenderers and should minimise competition.</seg>
<seg id="158">The SOW must always be product-neutral.</seg>
<seg id="159">Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the SOW is only permitted under strict conditions.</seg>
<seg id="160">Avoiding restrictive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the procurement documents must be avoided, since they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of the tenders and for manipulation in their evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="162">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="163">The same or similar rules In both countries, EU legislation on technical specifications has been transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="164">The services are generally product-neutral without factory specifications.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the performance descriptions, the individual services must generally be subdivided in detail into performance units with respective quantity data.</seg>
<seg id="166">Prices must be agreed on the basis of service units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.</seg>
<seg id="168">The specifications of performance must in any case be complete and unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="169">They shall contain precise quantities and shall not include services which do not determine whether they are required.</seg>
<seg id="170">Allowances according to lump sums or time are to be avoided as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite requirements in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The performance descriptions must enable tenderers to create their offerings securely and without extensive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender shall not be published until the procurement documents have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="175">There is no obligation to tender for works in lots in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="176">If it is possible according to the type of service to be assigned, the public contracting entities may divide works into several lots.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, construction services must in principle be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and/or by type or subject (specialised persons).</seg>
<seg id="178">This will allow SMEs to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible suppliers and make price agreements more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is considered to be the most economical as a rule.</seg>
<seg id="180">Assessment criteria in the Czech Republic must be indicated in the procurement documents, both in EU-wide and in national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">In this way, candidates should be able to identify in full and in conclusion the criteria on which their offers are to be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the indication of valuation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required for EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="183">In the case of national procurement procedures, the assessment criteria should only be recorded in an internal administrative award note.</seg>
<seg id="184">Contracting documents drawn up by freelance professionals may not contain references to these offices or participating planners or reviewers in Germany by the building construction and some road construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other unacceptable competitive advantages without the customer's knowledge of contact with these freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why freelancers may neither send procurement documents nor interpret planning documents for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contact person for the companies is the customer alone.</seg>
<seg id="188">There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic on this.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always required for large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="190">In both countries, the statutory provisions make it possible, to a certain extent, to award supplements to the already contracted company without the need to carry out a public procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">According to EU regulations and German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional services may not be separated from the main order without substantial disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a tighter limit of 20% applies to a corresponding award without public notice.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.</seg>
<seg id="195">If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is basically not possible according to the regulations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="196">In order to determine the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already awarded must be used.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to supplementary services, the scope of services may also be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, minorities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.</seg>
<seg id="199">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, the specifications contained references to national technical approvals or standards which had already been replaced by pan-European standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">Some performance specifications also contained product-related specifications - for example for graffiti protection, joint bands or noise protection plates - without this being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product was considered.</seg>
<seg id="205">Lists of services broken down by sub-service</seg>
<seg id="206">In none of the proceedings examined, the Federal Republic of Germany found breaches of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services broken down by part.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of performance descriptions</seg>
<seg id="208">In the vast majority of procedures, the procurement documents were finalised before the invitations to tender began.</seg>
<seg id="209">For some procedures, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tendering phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.</seg>
<seg id="210">Occasionally, the service directories contained items in which it was not established whether they were needed.</seg>
<seg id="211">A list of services for demolition work even consisted almost half of such demand positions.</seg>
<seg id="212">Lots and valuation criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">Many awards lacked the prescribed justification for the fact that the services mainly advertised by specialists were not further divided into partial lots.</seg>
<seg id="214">There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="215">References to freelancers</seg>
<seg id="216">A small part of the specifications contained references to the freelancers involved.</seg>
<seg id="217">Their names were partly on the cover pages or in annexed plans or opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even expressly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of invitation to tender."</seg>
<seg id="219">In particular in the field of building construction, the contracting entities attributed the above-mentioned complaints mainly to the failures of freelancers commissioned to prepare the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="220">The construction services pointed to the lack of capacity in order to be able to check the specifications sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="221">NK Ú</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender In the case of public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="223">The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.</seg>
<seg id="224">Suppliers and products were also specified in the tender for the construction of several university buildings.</seg>
<seg id="225">Performance descriptions with power units</seg>
<seg id="226">For construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the specifications of services.</seg>
<seg id="227">As power units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of performance descriptions</seg>
<seg id="229">When a motorway bypass was built, the specifications of performance were amended four times in the period August to September 2009,</seg>
<seg id="230">since the performance levels had increased considerably and the technical conditions had changed.</seg>
<seg id="231">Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary building studies and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services to be commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="232">When constructing a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not contain any product quality requirements.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lot and suitability criteria</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, the division of construction activities into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not obligatory.</seg>
<seg id="236">An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that with a loose allocation of selected parts, savings of up to EUR 31.6 million would have been possible at a total cost of EUR 620.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, in the case of six different works which were the subject of a single contract alone, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved in the case of a separate award.</seg>
<seg id="238">With a loose allocation of 20 bridges, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.</seg>
<seg id="239">When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority laid down very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.</seg>
<seg id="240">During the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required tenderers, in an open procedure, to prove, inter alia, at least three road construction projects carried out, each worth EUR 28 million, over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, no more than nine suppliers met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public award of another section of a motorway comprised six separate construction projects in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million over the last three years as a suitability criterion for the companies.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were allocated by a total of five companies which carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 procurement procedures with a contract volume of 528 million euros, only two or even only one tenderer tendered.</seg>
<seg id="245">The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Additional services</seg>
<seg id="247">When constructing a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures when awarding additional services in two cases, nor did it conclude any written contracts for the additional services.</seg>
<seg id="248">Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, supplements were generated in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case of up to EUR 165.4 million (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="249">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="250">For several university buildings, some services were not listed in the procurement documents, although their necessity was already known in the award process.</seg>
<seg id="251">Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the 20% threshold of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority carried out negotiated procedures with the contracted entities without notice of award.</seg>
<seg id="252">When constructing a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiated proceedings without a tender.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction period, the contracting authority expanded the scope of the work by EUR 2 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices for additional construction services awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.</seg>
<seg id="255">Further findings</seg>
<seg id="256">On the basis of a sampling of construction projects, NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic was up to EUR 14.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to an evaluation of long-term data from the German Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre, on the other hand, is up to 10.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison indicates that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="260">The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account the EU rules.</seg>
<seg id="261">They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">For example, the requirement for adequate determination of the specifications of performance is intended to allow tenderers to calculate and draw up their tenders appropriately;</seg>
<seg id="263">protect the customer from additional services to be agreed subsequently and also limit speculative margins.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the common basic requirements for procurement documents are complemented by regulations designed to further reduce competition restrictions and manipulation possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="265">In the Czech Republic there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria in the non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="266">The SOW requirements have been largely met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, deviations had to be challenged, which could also have led to restrictions of competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The existing requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.</seg>
<seg id="269">In the Czech Republic, according to the NKÚ audit findings, the awarding of large-scale services without lots or with only very large lots may result in restrictions on the provider field to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="270">The extensive reference requirements in the Czech Republic for road construction have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">Moreover, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">When awarding and remunerating additional or modified benefits, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to EU requirements and German provisions, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without procurement procedures with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a tighter limit of 20% applies, until which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiated procedure without notice.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="277">as the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the overrun is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised by public notice.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Define the type of procurement and take into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of award, the contracting authority shall determine the number of undertakings participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">It may leave the range of potential candidates and tenderers largely unrestricted, for example through the choice of an open procedure, or limit the scope of non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="283">Pan-European procurement procedures shall be applied for construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority shall take into account, in particular, the European competition and transparency bids.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total contract value of the construction work of a project is at or above the EU threshold of EUR 5,000,000 at present, the construction work must in principle be awarded throughout Europe in accordance with open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiated or competitive dialogue is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="288">The contracting authority may derogate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement in the case of construction projects which reach or exceed the EU threshold and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and that the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the total contract value.</seg>
<seg id="289">A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to remove the obligation to award construction services throughout Europe in principle.</seg>
<seg id="290">Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="291">The detailed justification of the type of award chosen and the examination of the obligation to apply the EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully transposed EU rules on procurement procedures and thresholds into national law.</seg>
<seg id="295">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and restricted procedures contained in the EURO Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU rules.</seg>
<seg id="297">There is freedom of choice between the open procedure and the restricted procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. However, other procedures are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or, in the case of national awards, the public tender is generally given priority. This is determined by budgetary and procurement law and by the anti-corruption directives.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of procurement - such as the restricted procedure or invitation to tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">The existence of an exceptional case must be clearly justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or public invitation to tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unlimited as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by fixing it on certain tenderers and to make possible price agreements between tenderers more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="302">The principle of public tender is a central element of corruption prevention in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimation of the estimated contract value is an essential basis for the selection of the correct type of procurement.</seg>
<seg id="304">The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the estimated costs in the area of public construction.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, inter alia, cost characteristic values for building categories, utilization units, components or individual construction services.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such cost characteristic values, the estimated order value of a planned project or a construction performance to be awarded can be determined.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few construction administrations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting entities in the Czech Republic cannot use central databases or average price determinations of comparable construction measures when determining the estimated costs of construction services.</seg>
<seg id="310">In most cases, the cost determination is based on estimates by the financing body or on the amount of the funds made available to the construction service.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures to standardize cost determination procedures are still in their early stages.</seg>
<seg id="312">Within the framework of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.</seg>
<seg id="313">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="314">This database is intended to collect information on material expenditure and construction and expansion services, as well as other data relevant to costs, in order to enable cost determination and determination of unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">In order to improve cost control, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a data collection for construction projects,</seg>
<seg id="316">which is intended to serve as a benchmark for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="317">Main inspection results BRH</seg>
<seg id="318">Choice of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting entities largely wrote off the works in the open procedure or in the public tender and thus followed the budgetary and procurement requirements.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the federal government's construction services in building construction were put out to public or open tenders.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">Some of the reasons why contracting entities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tender were lacking in the choice of non-public types of procurement.</seg>
<seg id="323">In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public procurement types have a significant competitive disadvantage compared to open procedures and public procurement procedures and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">In construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted to public tenders than to restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as to hands-free tenders.</seg>
<seg id="325">The investigation also showed that the offer prices for restricted tenders and hands-free contracts were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a Landesrechnungshof confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement types.</seg>
<seg id="327">The Federal Ministry of Construction even found double the differences between public and non-public procurement procedures as a result of its studies on economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="328">Taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="329">The audited contracting entities set up, as a rule, public procurement plans for the construction projects for which they had identified an estimated total contract sum of more than EUR 5,000,000, in which they defined the construction services to be awarded under EU-wide and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, more than 80% of construction work has always been awarded across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">An evasion of the commitment to EU-wide procurement through underestimated cost estimates was not noticeable.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, partially as a result of incorrect calculations, there was a de facto fall in the minimum proportion of EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="333">During construction, some contracting entities inadmissibly changed the definition of their procurement plans.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">For most of the audited construction measures, the share of EU-wide procurement was usually lower according to the settlement results than under the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, contracting entities were in breach of the requirement to invite all 1,000,000 euros and more in-depth singleness in EU-wide procedures,</seg>
<seg id="337">and chose national procedures instead.</seg>
<seg id="338">NK Ú</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of type of award</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several major construction measures, such as the construction of some sections of motorway, construction projects in the context of a large sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several partial contracts, although these services were identical or comparable.</seg>
<seg id="341">As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in breach of legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="342">Calculation methods for the estimated order value</seg>
<seg id="343">In road construction, the existing price databases for this sector were an insufficient tool to determine the expected contract values.</seg>
<seg id="344">The data were based on construction projects that had just been completed, but there were indications of a lack of cost-effectiveness, unnecessary additional performance costs or excessive profits of the contracted companies.</seg>
<seg id="345">For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined using the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="347">In construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by project architects or on estimates by investors.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimated values.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, but eight supplements led to a cost increase of EUR 2.1 million or 27% in the course of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase also occurring here.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.</seg>
<seg id="352">When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. When constructing a judicial building, costs increased disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had only expanded by 12%.</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have transposed into national law EU rules setting the type of procurement and taking into account the EU threshold. Therefore, the respective regulations correspond to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to non-public procurement procedures, public procedures or public tenders offer more companies the opportunity to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="357">The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of tenders and to the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="358">The risk of corruption is greatly improved by not restricting the field of applicants through tampering-prone specifications of the contracting entity and making price agreements between tenderers more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="359">The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="360">Under Czech legislation, contracting entities may award contracts by open or restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">According to the latest changes in procurement law, the number of tenderers may no longer be restricted in the case of procedures with previous competition.</seg>
<seg id="362">As a result, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, contracting entities have largely complied with the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services were inadmissibly allocated in order to avoid the requirements for the choice of the type of award.</seg>
<seg id="364">When taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be detected in Germany which led to a fall below the minimum proportion of tendered benefits across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="365">There is still no satisfactory solution in the Czech Republic to accurately determine the expected costs of construction work and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">Building administrations should, where appropriate, ensure, by means of further checks, that the requirements for the choice of type of procurement and the scope of services to be written off throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for appropriate cost determinations are established.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and notice</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies in advance of the invitation to tender of the proposed contracts.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and notices provide an important basis for Europe-wide competition.</seg>

<seg id="385">Procurement procedures may be started at the earliest one month after prior information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).</seg>
<seg id="386">Only in exceptional cases can the publication of preliminary information be dispensed with.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, the non-EU procurement procedures do not require prior information.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and participation competitions must be published on the Federal Internet portal and, where appropriate, also in newspapers or magazines before restricted tenders.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted invitations to tender without a competition, notices of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are required (ex ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">All planned lots of construction projects shall be included in the preliminary information.</seg>
<seg id="391">In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small size of the loose construction contracts.</seg>

<seg id="397">However, in the case of some open procedures, they reduced the time limit for submitting tenders, although the period of 52 days required between the submissions of the preliminary information and the notices had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the 12-month period of validity of the pre-information procedure had expired and before it had been extended.</seg>

<seg id="418">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage teaching system with prior information and publicity is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement in Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">Both countries have implemented EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector:</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates for non-public procurement types</seg>
<seg id="422">Unlike public procurement procedures, non-public procurement procedures do not allow any undertaking interested in carrying out the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="423">In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a preliminary selection of which undertakings should be invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention The EU rules allow a limit on the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, in the case of restricted procedures, at least five undertakings shall be required to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the case of negotiated procedures with a contract notice, at least three undertakings shall be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of requesting companies is a process within the procurement procedure which is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by giving unilateral preference to certain companies.</seg>
<seg id="430">In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both cases, the result can be significantly impaired at the expense of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="432">Contracting entities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate controls and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process step.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="435">The rules for the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the EUs, contracting entities should switch among the companies to be requested as often as possible when selecting candidates.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor can competition be restricted to companies located in certain regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The contracting entities shall justify the selection of candidates and document the course of the competition in their tendering notes.</seg>
<seg id="439">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, in the case of restricted invitations to tender, at least three and in the case of hands-free tenders, in principle several suitable candidates must be invited to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="441">Under the new Czech rules, it is inadmissible - apart from two special areas - to limit the number of tenderers in the case of restricted procedures and negotiated procedures.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the more-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.</seg>
<seg id="443">For example, if an employee has proposed a number of entities for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction department or a contracting agent from the contracting authority will normally have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed entity and/or complementing a new entity.</seg>
<seg id="444">The aim is to prevent a single person from defining the circle of undertakings to be participated in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">Otherwise, this could allow far-reaching agreements among stakeholders in the event of manipulative intentions.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of companies to be requested should be kept confidential, including to freelancers, and should not be made universally available.</seg>
<seg id="447">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic there are no corresponding rules for the establishment and confidentiality of candidate lists.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.</seg>
<seg id="451">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of candidates</seg>
<seg id="454">The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit tenders in the case of non-public contracts has been respected with few exceptions.</seg>
<seg id="455">An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-pan-European tendering procedures for construction services in the construction sector showed that in the case of restricted tenders issued by the Federal Government in Germany, the contracting entities requested an average of 6.6 companies to submit tenders and 4.4 companies to award tenders on a hands-free basis.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of companies and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular for trades with few providers, the contracting entities did not always change the circle of selected candidates.</seg>
<seg id="458">In particular, they took into account companies already known to them and proven from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="459">For this reason, they indicated that, in the case of non-public procedures, they had to ensure the suitability of the undertakings requesting competition before the invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="460">The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction on regional tenderers in the case of non-public procurement procedures, but indeed a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in the case of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting entities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services for non-public procurement procedures is on average considerably lower and therefore, for example, longer routes are more important than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="462">More-eye principle and proposals Freelance</seg>
<seg id="463">Contrary to the rules, contracting entities predominantly failed to modify the proposed list of companies by an independent person.</seg>
<seg id="464">In particular, they justified this by lack of machining capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.</seg>
<seg id="465">It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="466">Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the list of applicants and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting entities.</seg>
<seg id="467">As a result, the contracting entities did not protect themselves from possible manipulations to the extent required.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidential treatment of bidding lists</seg>
<seg id="469">At a contracting authority, the lists of undertakings to be requested were recorded in a data processing system which could be consulted by all staff of that department.</seg>
<seg id="470">In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or authorised undertakings could have been passed on unauthorised and, for example, could have been made possible by agreements between those undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">Only in a few cases did the documentation of the award procedures contain justifications for the selection of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="473">NK Ú</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection of candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of a motorway ring, tenderers did not receive information on the assessment criteria and evaluation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="476">In the case of restricted procedures for upgrading and modernising waterways and ports, the notices did not contain information on how the selection of candidates should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="477">In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the maximum number of companies to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Procurement Committee then carried out a lottery procedure for the selection of undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="479">However, this approach, which was in principle admissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="481">Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, the two countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">With the multi-eye principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the exclusive authority of the contracting entities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements limit such abuses.</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced provision of the largely unlimited number of bidders in the case of non-public procedures can in particular counteract possible manipulative restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been insufficiently implemented and that the manipulation potential for abusive restriction of the subscriber field has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting authorities should eliminate the shortcomings identified in full.</seg>
<seg id="486">Offer phase</seg>
<seg id="487">The announcement of the award or the invitation to tender shall begin with the tender phase in which the undertakings may draw up tenders on the basis of the procurement documents sent to them.</seg>
<seg id="488">Candidates may submit their tenders until the end of the tendering period fixed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="490">There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">Contracting entities shall comply with the national rules aimed at counteracting the possibilities of manipulation existing during the tendering phase.</seg>
<seg id="492">These are mainly organizational specifications and controls.</seg>
<seg id="493">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="495">The procurement documents on the basis of which the undertakings are to draw up their tenders must in principle only be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Freelancers involved in the procurement procedure This task must not be performed.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority shall ensure that all candidates receive the same information even during the tendering phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of ambiguity in the procurement documents or other questions concerning the invitation to tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="499">Freelance professionals commissioned to draw up the procurement documents may not provide information.</seg>
<seg id="500">Contacts between freelancers and applicants must be prevented during the entire offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="501">Freelancers may not become a hub of the procurement procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders sent by post or directly shall be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Electronic tenders shall have technical encryption.</seg>
<seg id="504">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may also assign the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents to external service companies whose employees must be obliged to keep the offers secret and to diligently fulfil the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="506">Tenders received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and sent directly, immediately and unopened to a member of staff responsible for safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This staff member shall not participate in the award.</seg>
<seg id="508">Tenders received shall be kept under wraps until the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, tenders received are marked with a reference number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority shall record the tender data, including contract numbers, and the creation and receipt information in a protocol.</seg>
<seg id="511">The storage of tenders is not specified in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="512">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">The audits on the offer phase focused mainly on the award procedures of a construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="515">Dispatch of procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The contracting entities of the audited building administration dispatched the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and dispatched by an external service provider.</seg>
<seg id="517">Freelance employees did not send out procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to applicants</seg>
<seg id="519">The audited building administration largely did not comply with the requirements for separating planning and allocation when designating the contact persons for enquiries and information.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the performance descriptions, contrary to the specifications, it did not specify employees from the contracting authority, but from the project management as contact persons.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some procurement documents even included the names of freelancers who had created the performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="522">In the case of requests during the offer phase, not all candidates received the same information in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="523">Labelling of tenders</seg>
<seg id="524">At the audited building administration, all tenders received were marked with an entry stamp and an entry note.</seg>
<seg id="525">In some hands-free contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the proposals for corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="526">Keeping tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Following their identification, not all tenders were sent directly and immediately to the official in charge of the storage, who included the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">In the meantime, tenders were placed in an open compartment of the post office to which each official had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another department had hung a mailbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers that had been made remained overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">Since the insertion slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the department would have had the opportunity to take out and manipulate tenders received.</seg>
<seg id="531">NK Ú</seg>
<seg id="532">No defects were complained about on the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="534">During the tendering phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers participating in the tendering procedure should be prevented in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="535">By providing all tenderers with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.</seg>
<seg id="536">The rules on receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of offers appear suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">The corresponding specifications in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening date, the previously closed offers are opened and their contents are read out and thus made known.</seg>
<seg id="543">From the opening date, tenderers shall be bound by their tenders until the end of the award period specified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">There are no separate EU rules for the opening of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition.</seg>
<seg id="547">The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and comprehensibility of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulations and changes to the submitted offers.</seg>
<seg id="548">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be determined by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrollably when the offers are opened.</seg>
<seg id="552">In most procurement procedures, tenderers may participate in the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="553">Only tenders submitted to the negotiator when the first tender was opened shall be accepted for opening.</seg>
<seg id="554">Tenders received late may in principle no longer be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the acts undertaken and the results of the opening of the tender shall be recorded in a protocol specifying, inter alia, the names of the tenderers and the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="556">The minutes must be read out and signed by the negotiating board.</seg>
<seg id="557">It can also be signed by the bidders present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a committee shall open tenders.</seg>
<seg id="560">Freelancers can also participate.</seg>
<seg id="561">The Committee may also be entrusted with further stages of the procurement procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, a negotiator and a writer open the offer.</seg>
<seg id="563">The negotiator shall be a staff member of the issuing body.</seg>
<seg id="564">The Head of Negotiations and, in the case of awards in building construction, the Secretary should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents as well as in the award and execution of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or late tenders - must be recorded in the minutes of the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="567">The German regulations provide that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.</seg>
<seg id="568">The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to persons directly responsible for the processing.</seg>
<seg id="569">Corresponding Czech regulations do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="570">If only one tender is received during a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, it shall not be opened and shall be returned unvalued.</seg>

<seg id="576">They conducted the opening dates with negotiators and scribes who were not entrusted with any other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, there were occasional cases in which freelancers opened tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>

<seg id="579">In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, for example, the tenders submitted late were not registered, and signatures were even missing in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="581">Labelling of tenders</seg>
<seg id="582">The contracting entities examined during the cross-sectional examination marked the tenders according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="583">Insufficient labelling had been detected in the case of tests carried out by some beneficiaries over a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, these contracting entities changed their labelling practice following the complaint by the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="585">NK Ú</seg>
<seg id="586">Offer term</seg>
<seg id="587">When road maintenance measures were awarded, a tender was received by the contracting authority only one month after the closing date for the submission of tenders. The contracting authority nevertheless accepted this offer.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="589">The rules governing the opening of tenders in both countries agree in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the transparency principle. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of offers can be substantially limited.</seg>
<seg id="590">The specifications in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict manipulation possibilities such as subsequent modifications of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, the persons responsible for opening the tenders may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The only few complaints in total demonstrate the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of supply.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">Examination and evaluation of tenders The contracting authority must examine and evaluate the tenders available at the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="596">It shall determine the tender for the award of the award which best meets the requirements according to the prescribed award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">The EU's guidelines provide for a multistage procedure:</seg>
<seg id="599">The suitability of tenderers must first be established.</seg>
<seg id="600">Tenderers must be economically and financially efficient and possess the necessary professional and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="601">Participation in the award procedure must in principle be excluded from undertakings which, for example, are finally convicted of bribery or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="602">Tenders submitted by the non-excluded tenderers shall be verified in terms of calculation, technology and economics and shall be assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting entity shall determine the most economically advantageous tender. Tenders with abnormally low prices must be examined by the client.</seg>
<seg id="604">The examination and evaluation of tenders is a phase of the award procedure which is particularly susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, tenderers may be unjustifiably excluded or tenders which do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">By preferring or disadvantaging bidders, the result of the evaluation can be impaired inadmissibly and thus the determination of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take special steps to ensure that the persons responsible for the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.</seg>
<seg id="608">It must also ensure the transparency and comprehensibility of the procedure and of the decisions taken.</seg>
<seg id="609">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="611">In line with EU requirements, tenders in both countries should be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements for the qualification of undertakings to be submitted and the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the procurement documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">After verification of bidding suitability, the suitability criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="614">The evaluation shall be limited to the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first of all be formally examined as to whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities which could indicate possible intentions of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="616">If tenderers are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the evaluation of the tenders results in an unreasonably low price, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his tender.</seg>
<seg id="618">The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="619">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for processing them.</seg>
<seg id="621">Only the contracting authority may carry out the review of tenders and the invoicing of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="622">It shall only appoint staff who are not involved in the award decision or in the implementation of the measure.</seg>
<seg id="623">The performance of the further audit and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.</seg>
<seg id="624">If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for decisions to be taken by contracting entities.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, procurement committees shall be set up to examine and evaluate tenders.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees prepare evaluation reports with award proposals.</seg>
<seg id="628">As in Germany, only contracting entities have to decide on the contracts.</seg>
<seg id="629">If evidence or declarations required for submission of tenders in Germany are submitted only incompletely, the contracting authority shall give tenderers the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only if the documents are still not available after the expiry of the deadline must the offer be excluded from the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a tenderer fails to do so, it must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, in addition to the total price, the standard prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.</seg>
<seg id="634">If, on the basis of the price structure of the offer, there are indications of prices for partial services which are too low or too high, the tenderer should be asked to remove these ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id="635">If it does not succeed and the awarding authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their supply, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of the construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.</seg>
<seg id="638">A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">A contract may not be awarded in Germany on offers with unreasonably high or low prices.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more tenders fall below the applicable price determination of the contracting entity or the sums offered by the other tenderers by 10% or more, the tenderers shall prove the correct calculation of their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the tenders concerned.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the invitation to tender may be cancelled after the economic assessment if only tenders with unjustifiable low prices are available.</seg>
<seg id="643">In contrast to German public procurement law, the contract cannot be refused for this reason in the case of tenders with prices substantially exceeding the calculation of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is a suspicion of restrictive conduct in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">The latter shall decide on the measures to be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.</seg>
<seg id="646">For example, the Supervisory Authority must agree to a level higher than EUR 50,000 for construction services if the contract is to be awarded by hand, if a contract is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price or if the invitation to tender is to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">There are no regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Suitability and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">The vast majority of tendering procedures audited were in line with the requirements set out above.</seg>
<seg id="652">For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting entities did not verify the suitability of the companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">A beneficiary contracted companies without the required qualifications being fully available.</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, it was not comprehensible whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the award criteria disclosed in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the 'price' criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting entities used unauthorised persons to examine the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="657">Freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks which could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction services justified this with insufficient staffing capacity in the respective areas.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to diligently fulfil the contractual obligations participated in the freelancers responsible for examining the offers.</seg>
<seg id="660">In most cases, it was also incomprehensible for the construction services whether the offers were only available to the persons directly responsible for processing.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and auditing of tenders</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting entities submitted the open tenders to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the tenders and the computational examination itself and having documented their results.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the tenders without this being comprehensible to the contracting entities.</seg>
<seg id="664">In the examined documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partly not marked or only insufficiently marked.</seg>
<seg id="665">Economic efficiency check</seg>
<seg id="666">For a sample in a construction administration, the most favourable tenders for three quarters of the tendering procedures audited were more than 10% of the estimated costs previously established.</seg>
<seg id="667">Every twentieth award procedure has been cancelled due to inappropriate offer prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">Not all bidding tests and information discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, more information was missing, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.</seg>
<seg id="670">The deviations were often justified only on a flat-rate basis, e.g. by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction services stated that the detection and verification of mixed calculations was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of an invitation to tender issued by an institution under public law, the offer price of the most favourable tender was 66% below the estimated value of those services previously established.</seg>
<seg id="673">Further calculation checks or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="674">In an enlightenment interview, the contracting authority did not find any evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.</seg>
<seg id="675">It thus remained unclear whether the estimated value determined was excessive or the offer price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the client assessed the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not hold quality or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another invitation to tender, a construction service awarded the contract for a tender whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.</seg>
<seg id="678">It did not cancel the invitation to tender, citing the non-substantive reasoning that this company could be concluded to have a reasonable calculation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspicion of irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">There were two cases of irregularities in an audited building administration, both of which were reported to the technical supervisor.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one case, the calculation of two tenderers was identical in the case of an invitation to tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both tenders from the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="682">When applying the other provisions, the tests did not reveal any significant complaints.</seg>
<seg id="683">NK Ú</seg>
<seg id="684">Aptitude test</seg>
<seg id="685">In many of the audited construction projects, including higher education, road construction and the extension of the rail network, the contracting entities did not exclude tenderers from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements set out in the tender documents or could not demonstrate their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had complied with the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="687">When awarding works for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="688">In the case of a construction project for the extension of the rail network, the contracting authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion "shortening of the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in a method.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the shortening offered was insufficiently taken into account by the bidders in second and third positions.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the offer selection</seg>
<seg id="692">In the case of three housing promotion procedures, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it applied and the basis on which it had selected the successful tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="693">When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller contracts up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys at prices and delivery conditions.</seg>
<seg id="694">Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="696">The rules for examining and evaluating tenders are in line with EU requirements in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ from one another.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, detailed requirements, in particular regarding the implementation of the multi-eye principle and the protection of offers, regulate the procedure more than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be examined.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, some of the tendering procedures examined had to establish that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or insufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="701">However, possible manipulative interventions are favoured without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly serious deficiency was the submission of all tenders to third parties, without the contracting authority having previously adequately reviewed and documented the tenders, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in the subsequent procedure.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contracting authorities have tasks carried out in the examination and evaluation of tenders by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">In assessing the appropriateness of prices, the audited services in Germany have not always made full use of the specified instruments and have only insufficiently examined the price structure of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, complaints were made primarily in the suitability test and in the application of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Conclusion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After examining and evaluating the tenders, the award procedure shall be concluded by awarding the award or by cancelling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers shall be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">Undertakings may examine the intended award by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or by other means of communication within 15 days and may initiate a review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="711">A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.</seg>
<seg id="712">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="713">If a tenderer submits a request for verification within the information period, the conclusion of a contract is only possible after the final decision in the verification procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">Undertakings may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court in the context of this review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="715">The purpose of the review procedure is to ensure the legal protection of undertakings and to encourage the contracting authority to observe the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="716">To this end, he must document the procedure sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="717">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented the EU rules on information and verification procedures.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the contracting authority must decide on the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="722">The customer is to place the order within the announced surcharge period,</seg>
<seg id="723">also because tenderers are no longer bound by their tenders after the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="724">In the case of open and restricted procedures or public and restricted invitations to tender, the contracting authority must in principle not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="725">The unsuccessful tenderers shall be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for not taking into account their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="726">Tendering procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, for example where the tender prices are excessive or where the tenders do not meet the requirements of the invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="727">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the 10-day and 15-day information and waiting obligation prior to the award of the contract also applies to the non-European construction services.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.</seg>
<seg id="730">In the case of the other procedures in Germany, tenderers may be informed of the award decision only after the award has been made.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure should be abolished if only one tender has been received or if only one tender has been evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it meets the conditions of the invitation to tender and is economical.</seg>
<seg id="733">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">There were only a few complaints about the audited contracts when the award procedures were concluded.</seg>
<seg id="736">Some companies received contract letters for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information periods, which can lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In individual cases, the order letters also contained content deviating from the offer content, such as modified dates, according to open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, the contracting entities did not comply with the award deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="739">In the case of an open procedure, a contracting entity therefore awarded the contract for the second most favourable tender, since a company with a 50% more favourable tender was no longer willing to export the services at the price initially offered after the end of the contract period.</seg>
<seg id="740">NK Ú</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of a construction measure in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.</seg>
<seg id="742">In the case of some contracts, such as construction of road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the statutory deadline.</seg>
<seg id="743">When awarding construction services for the rehabilitation of former military sites, the contracting authority only sent the notification of the award to all tenderers after the statutory deadline had expired.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the EU guidelines for the conclusion of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of unsuccessful candidates or tenderers will increase the scope for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The scope of legal protection is also extended in Czech public procurement law to include contracts below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, the deadlines for ordering were exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In future, construction administrations should avoid the shortcomings identified when completing their procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement procedures must be documented comprehensibly during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the reasons for the individual decisions.</seg>
<seg id="753">For EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.</seg>
<seg id="754">The order data are also recorded in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention Documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="756">A carefully and promptly prepared documentation enables the traceability of the award decisions.</seg>
<seg id="757">In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for tenderers for contracts above the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to substantially justify procurement decisions considerably narrows the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">The notice of a contract awarded under an EU-wide procurement procedure shall be sent to the EU Office for Official Publications within 48 days.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office shall publish the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thereby implement the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting entities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the EU Commission compiles an annual EU statistic to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.</seg>
<seg id="763">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements into national law.</seg>
<seg id="766">The documentation and reporting arrangements for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the publication obligation for contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notice period is reduced to 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is an obligation to publish only in the case of restricted invitations to tender and in the case of hands-free awards from value limits of EUR 25,000 or EUR 15,000 without VAT (so-called ex post transparency).</seg>
<seg id="771">Below these thresholds and in the case of public tenders, only the undertakings participating in the competition procedure receive information on the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="772">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="773">BRH</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of the tendering procedures audited were not fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The tendering notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national rules.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the case of a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to an undertaking, even though its tender did not contain evidence to be compulsorily submitted.</seg>
<seg id="778">In a few cases, the documents of the contracting entities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="779">Notices of award of contracts</seg>
<seg id="780">In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting entities failed to publicise the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="781">Further procurement procedures lacked evidence that the contracting entities had made public the contracts awarded.</seg>
<seg id="782">Reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="783">The statistical statements viewed contained the required minimum data. They had been created and sent on schedule.</seg>
<seg id="784">Ex-postal transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">Audited construction administrations in most cases published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="786">However, a building administration did not publish this data because of a transmission error.</seg>
<seg id="787">The building administration only noticed this mistake after half a year,</seg>
<seg id="788">so that the contract data of the procurement procedures completed until then have not been published.</seg>
<seg id="789">NK Ú</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a large sporting event, the documentation of procurement procedures showed considerable deficiencies. These were mainly incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the reports of the valuation commissions.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some minutes of the offer openings were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Notices of award of contracts</seg>
<seg id="794">For several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded have been published only late or not at all.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="796">The documentation and reporting requirements in both countries are broadly consistent and implement EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="797">This guarantees the transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="798">The rules applicable in the Czech Republic for publication go slightly further than the requirements in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="799">The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the announcements substantially restricted the orruption-preventing effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">The construction management should improve the transparency of her assignment procedures and placings of order further and follow completely her obligatory registrations and report duties.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two priorities which are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works by contracting authorities: the application of EU procurement rules and corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="804">The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Anti-corruption measures are not only designed to prevent or at least reduce corruption. They should also avoid economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two Court of Auditors on the application of the public procurement rules in both countries, together with the comparison of these rules, provide information on similarities and differences which may be helpful for both countries in the development of their public procurement law and its application.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement rules</seg>
<seg id="808">The EU's requirements for the award of construction services have been transposed into national law by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="809">Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of works and the consideration of the essential tenders of competition, the equal treatment of the parties and the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">The construction administrations of both countries have, in some cases, substantially underpinned these bids by further administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has to a large extent also transferred the requirements on EU-wide construction services to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the surveys carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that construction administrations have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="813">The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints highlighted when implementing the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">The tests carried out in the Czech Republic have mainly highlighted risks which affect the profitability of the awards.</seg>
<seg id="815">For example, incomplete specifications of services necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, the cost calculations were usually inadequate. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential tenderers and restricted competition, particularly in the case of transport buildings.</seg>
<seg id="816">Corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="817">The investigations did not aim to detect corruption cases,</seg>
<seg id="818">also because the Court of Auditors does not have appropriate instruments for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of works and how these requirements are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">In preventing corruption, the two countries have set different priorities.</seg>
<seg id="821">In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unlimited competition, as well as transparency and controls as key elements of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech rules aim above all at increased transparency of procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles are also implemented in the guidelines for the award of construction services and are geared towards their specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="826">In some cases, the rules set out very precisely how the anti-corruption requirements should be taken into account when the procurement procedures are carried out and when the persons involved are selected.</seg>
<seg id="827">In particular, the BRH considers that the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is an appropriate instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The GRC therefore sees no fundamental need for changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations when awarding construction services.</seg>
<seg id="830">The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The deficiencies identified in subdivisions have shown inadequacies in the implementation of some specifications.</seg>
<seg id="832">Construction administrations should further train their employees on the requirements for corruption prevention and raise their awareness of this problem.</seg>
<seg id="833">A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the construction administrations to freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.</seg>
<seg id="835">Tampering and corruption-related tasks should therefore only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">NK Ú</seg>
<seg id="837">The Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption at governmental level, in which the area of public procurement is the most important component.</seg>
<seg id="838">The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.</seg>
<seg id="839">The NKÚ audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, as contracting entities must justify the cost-effectiveness of the award of contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the assessments and must properly document and publish all these aspects.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">The NKÚ and the BRH generally evaluate the implementation of the EU guidelines positively.</seg>
<seg id="843">The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that EU competition, equal treatment and transparency bids are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the allocation of construction services, both auditors believe that construction administrations in their countries should continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.</seg>
<seg id="847">The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased as open procedures provide a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="848">A greater division of works into lots can also have a favourable effect on supply prices, provided that greater competition is achieved with a higher number of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring that procurement procedures are implemented correctly is an essential basis for efficient procurement activities by contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks - with the exception of transport projects - are performed by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.</seg>
<seg id="851">The Courts of Auditors of both countries have the concern to continue to develop the relevant findings for them, even after the completion of their joint project, and to ask parliament and government of their country, if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="852">Both Court of Auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and their implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI). The principles and findings set out above are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure economic procurement of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.</seg>

<seg id="18">Exam aim:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The management of VAT and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures applied by the financial authorities to intergovernmental assistance should be examined.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit should evaluate how financial management has implemented the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, additional test fields linked to the VAT should be processed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The findings made should be compared in order to determine whether the tax procedures can be optimised.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audit period was from 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from before the audit period until the completion of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit</seg>
<seg id="25">The Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit for the administration of the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the previous parallel investigation, they had uncovered suspected intra-Community transactions:</seg>
<seg id="27">which made a further examination seem appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result of the audit findings, the two Court of Auditors made recommendations on the management of the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aim of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the suspected cases identified should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also dealt with other matters. This included selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables and VAT auditing of large enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Court of Auditors found that:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous audit</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: The rules governing the registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">During the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the registration procedures for the VAT in the two countries and identified differences which caused problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxpayers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This has also been taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798/2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of the persons obliged to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="38">The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Court of Auditors expected Member States to agree on appropriate arrangements to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible, in accordance with their decision in principle.</seg>
<seg id="40">Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the final version of the draft.</seg>
<seg id="41">These common rules are no longer included. The two Court of Auditors regret this.</seg>
<seg id="42">They still consider such regulations important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of Summary Notifications As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended that Member States submit Summary Notifications (ZM) monthly in future.</seg>
<seg id="44">The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be revised more rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EG amending Directive 2006/112/EG on the common system of value added tax with a view to combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions shortened the time limit for the submission of the ZM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the CZ, this specification was implemented by an amendment of the VAT Act which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, implementation did not take effect until 1 July 2010. It has thus not transposed the obligation to hand over the ZM monthly into national law in due time.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Data comparison of pre-registration VAT and ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of procedures for pre-registration VAT and ZM The German financial administration has taken up the recommendation issued by the Bundesrechnungshof and has set up a working group to work out possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components and approaches to a risk management system at EU level In the course of the first audit, the two Court of Auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria and elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this is not done, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems which have both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Bundesrechnungshof concentrated on German participation in the "Platform for Risk Management."</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Verification of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the first audit, the Court of Auditors had jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been exported or which had been declared differently by the taxpayers of the two States in the VAT pre-declarations (or VAT declarations) or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the audit.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits carried out by the Tax Offices of both States had not yet been completed when the first parallel audit was completed.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit showed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. Appropriate measures had been taken by the respective financial administrations (including: subsequent VAT determinations or the prevention of VAT refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between taxpayers in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is used to identify vulnerable taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States may participate in this system on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data under EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the point of view of an active participating State, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">As a result, no information could be obtained on which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as highly risky cases.</seg>
<seg id="68">The NKU found both normal transactions and those suspected of VAT fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.</seg>
<seg id="69">ZF was able to check sales at high risk only to a limited extent. This was especially true for "missing traders," whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="70">Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports</seg>
<seg id="71">it is recommended that customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely to monitor the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany and a number of other countries have rejected active participation in EUROCANET because they do not have a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Bundesrechnungshof found that the German financial administration uses other instruments to identify taxpayers who are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="74">However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The EU Council agreed on a draft regulation:</seg>
<seg id="76">created by EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="80">Requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are therefore processed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Federal Court of Auditors and the NKU compared the statistics sent by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">These statistics contained inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two Court of Auditors consider a renewed debate on statistics at EU level to be useful in order to avoid any remaining inconsistencies in the future.</seg>
<seg id="84">If this is not done, the statistics cannot be adequately used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">An analysis of detailed data may make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">Both Court of Auditors consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should endeavour to achieve at least the average recovery rate.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Commission should assist Member States in this, if desired.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. VAT testing at large enterprises</seg>
<seg id="90">The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large enterprises in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from financial administrations that they considered important in this context.</seg>
<seg id="92">It became clear that the situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="93">The CZ has a system for the selection of risky cases which includes a large amount of relevant data (including: information on VAT audits, balance sheet data, profit and loss accounts).</seg>
<seg id="94">As a result, the VAT control can be effectively controlled and analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="95">A special tax office for large enterprises is to be set up in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is still no comparable system in Germany. This makes it difficult to control and analyze the VAT control as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="97">The German financial administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="98">Various risk management components, which are still to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Examination procedures</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">Division II - Government Revenue and Regional Departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited between May 2009 and February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="102">Audited bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 CET: Finanzamt (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FA in Hodonín, FA in Hradec Králové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA in Písek, FA in Pilsen, FA Prague 1, FA Prague 4, FA Prague 8, FA in Rakovník, FA in Sokolov, FA in Tábor, FA in Vysoké Mýto, FA in Zlín and FA in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Examination procedure in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">From February 2009 to February 2010, the test area for traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich audited.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:</seg>
<seg id="107">• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. In addition, they conducted interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance (Bundesfinanzministerium).</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files from the following sites were included in the examination: • Erlangen, Central Tax Office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Special Finance Office Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmost-Essen; •</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, discussions were held with the universities Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Bundesrechnungshof reported the audit results to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors</seg>
<seg id="112">In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both Court of Auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">In December 2008, the Presidents of both Court of Auditors signed the Parallel Audit Cooperation Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams informed themselves about the initial results obtained during the preparation of the examination, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The audit teams exchanged the prior knowledge and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint audit report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two Court of Auditors identified the following topics for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of recommendations made in the previous report; • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • Review of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany; • Audit the procedures of the two tax administrations concerning intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits on large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Audit of VAT management in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint audit</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Implementation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Harmonisation of conditions for registration of taxpayers within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">in response to the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended that the VAT registration requirements be adapted and that new rules be introduced for the deletion of registration in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="125">These amended rules should more effectively curb the risk of possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="126">In certain cases, it was found that VAT registration of taxable persons was not cancelled if they failed to fulfil their obligations under Czech Law No 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT Law").</seg>
<seg id="127">To date, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted a amendment to require the VAT to be deleted if taxpayers repeatedly fail to file VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the Czech VAT Act, the FA may delete the registration of a taxable person on its own initiative if: (a) the taxable person has not carried out transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for such transactions; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT law; c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the conditions for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="129">The first examination showed that, in view of the existing legal situation, the FA Prague 1 is required to cancel the VAT registration of "foreign taxable persons" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year, if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Prague 1 FA often did not cancel the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">Accordingly, the FA has the power to cancel the registration of a foreign taxable person if he has not provided, in the preceding calendar year, goods or services which are not subject to taxation or exempt from tax and are entitled to deduction.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly submission of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="135">On the basis of the initial audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended introducing the monthly levy of ZM.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive, which reduced the cycle for the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The ZM must now be delivered electronically.</seg>
<seg id="138">In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) VAT law are provided for a person registered in another Member State as subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="139">The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008/8/EG amending Directive 2006/112/EG as regards the place of supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation referred to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">In its system, the Czech financial administration automatically compares data ATIS4 intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">The proper collection of VAT is an essential prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">Therefore, the fight against VAT fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this is demonstrated, inter alia, by an investigation published by the European Commission in October 2009.</seg>
<seg id="148">In this report, an external expert estimated the loss of VAT for the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006. After evaluating the available data, the tax default for the above period was estimated at EUR 90 to 113 billion. This was based on the fact that the EU-25 lose on average 12% of the VAT they are entitled to each year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The estimated tax default for the CZ was in 2006 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first audit found that a Member State alone cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS).</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">In relation to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).</seg>
<seg id="153">For this purpose, intra-Community transactions at risk were selected by taxable persons exported within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The EUROFISC network aims to optimise administrative assistance in tax matters and to combat tax fraud more effectively. Cooperation between competent authorities should be improved in order to identify fraud as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN-Rat6 approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008, while adopting the principles for the functioning of the system.</seg>
<seg id="157">The EUROFISC model is EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian Financial Administration in cooperation with the other Member States, with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7.</seg>
<seg id="158">The purpose of the system is to detect high-risk transactions and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The assessment of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Harmonisation of conditions for registration of taxpayers within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">Based on a detailed questionnaire, the German financial administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system itself is constantly being improved.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data specified in the questionnaire are now recorded electronically and will be available for later research. They are thus part of the risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission had 1798/2003 a proposal8 amending the Regulation. It provided, inter alia, for common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="168">The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended that the Federal Ministry of Finance should not fall short of the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly submission of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, a law9 transposing EU directives into national law was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="173">It contains, inter alia, provisions on the monthly levy of ZM on intra-Community supplies</seg>
<seg id="174">and enters into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-declarations and the VAT ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the VAT pre-declarations and the VAT ZM</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint federal-state working group has been set up,</seg>
<seg id="178">has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the VAT pre-registration and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="179">The approach is still being discussed with the countries.</seg>
<seg id="180">In addition, this working group has dealt with a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level Relevant information is exchanged at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the initiative and initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 18 Action Plan in the written procedure of 2006 October 2006-2007.</seg>
<seg id="185">The platform's members covered the following topics in 4 sub-groups: • Risk management tools, • Influence on the behaviour of taxpayers, • Evaluation, • Update the Risk Management Guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports from the Risk Management Tools subgroups and the Risk Management Guide were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The question of conditions for VAT registration and its deletion in different countries was addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amended Council Regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="192">The issues of registration and deletion are reserved until further notice for the national legislation of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended that the Federal Ministry of Finance not fall short of the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2010, the Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the last version of the draft.</seg>
<seg id="196">It no longer contains common rules for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="197">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="198">The two Court of Auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly submission of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="201">With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous audit, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">The RL 2008/117/EG of the Council amending the RL 2006/112/EG on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the cycle of submitting the corresponding ZM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the CZ, this provision was implemented by the amendment of the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not implement the commitment to the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and therefore not within the deadline, while the CZ complied with the EU's requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-declarations and the VAT for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT pre-declarations and/or the VAT</seg>
<seg id="206">The German Finance Administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to draw up possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">The Bundesrechnungshof concentrated on German participation in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Verification of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">The first audit jointly examined transactions in which there were doubts as to whether they had actually been exported or whether inconsistencies had been found in taxpayers' declarations in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the purpose of verification, in which the tax audit carried out by the VAT of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">A Czech taxable person acquired goods worth EUR 22 686 from a German taxable person in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration, since the period referred to as taxpayer did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for domestic German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="218">Through international assistance pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that under German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods did not need a VAT identification number in order to benefit from the tax exemption for intra-Community deliveries of goods.</seg>
<seg id="219">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the audit carried out by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxable person submitted an additional VAT declaration declaring the acquisition of goods of the above value and at the same time claiming his right to deduct VAT of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">A Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">However, he stated that he did not purchase the goods and therefore did not explain them in his VAT statement.</seg>
<seg id="223">On the basis of a provision of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German financial administration refused to process the request because the turnover linked to the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech FA was not able to obtain any documents, the tax audit remained unsuccessful and the original tax determination was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="225">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the acquisition in its regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">A Czech taxpayer allegedly purchased a car worth EUR 48 500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, it did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, he had not made a VAT statement since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information provided from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the FA requested the taxpayer to file a subsequent tax return in March 2007, which the taxpayer failed to do.</seg>
<seg id="232">The audit established that the FA had carried out further audits in this tax case in 2007. It found that the car in question had been sold by the taxable person to a used car dealer in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech FA assessed the taxation period December 2004 by imposing additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="234">The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings on the Czech taxpayer's assets; an insolvency administrator has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability should be irrecoverable.</seg>

<seg id="237">In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer was reported to have delivered new vehicles (cars) with a total value of 198 167 euros to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="238">The reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 stated that the German taxpayer was subject to criminal tax proceedings in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">The audit of the Bundesrechnungshof showed that, after the conclusion of the proceedings, there was evidence that the German taxpayer was involved in fraud.</seg>
<seg id="240">The intra-Community acquisition of goods was subject to an acquisition tax of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="242">Based on information provided by the German Financial Administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxable person has taken place for the taxation periods April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA established an additional tax of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">In February 2005, Czech taxpayer A allegedly acquired a machine with a total value of EUR 58 000 from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="246">In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer allegedly supplied the Czech taxpayer B with a machine worth EUR 88 027. B, however, contested the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had acquired the machine from a German company established in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech taxable person A did not indicate the acquisition of the goods from the German taxable person in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">The German FA's reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German taxable person had not supplied an intra-Community supply of a machine worth EUR 58 000 but a supply within the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the audit, the Bundesrechnungshof found that the intra-Community supply of the machinery was classified as a domestic supply after the completion of an audit and the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">A German taxpayer allegedly delivered goods worth EUR 11 600 to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had carried out its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration indicating inadmissible acquisitions from another Member State, including acquisitions in the abovementioned amount.</seg>
<seg id="255">The Bundesrechnungshof found that, after receiving a reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the German taxable person's VAT return and fixed an additional VAT of EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="256">Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an investigation is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="257">The German taxpayer's ZM has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxpayer who surrendered the ZM can also correct it.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German financial administration pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the acquisition of a car worth EUR 47 400 by a Czech taxable person in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After an examination for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA fixed the Czech taxpayer's tax liability at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer had been cancelled because he had failed to fulfil his tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="262">The Czech FA had sent the documents to the Czech police.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer has not yet corrected its information in the ZM but has appealed against the tax notice.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person supplied a total value of EUR 33 205 to a Czech taxable person, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="266">The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA examined the reasons for the inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer made repeated subsequent VAT returns for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, the Czech FA was not able to clarify the difference in the acquisition amount of CZK 134 273 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this by the fact that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated and accepted the VAT statements made.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">A German taxable person had delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA reviewed the actual value of the supply.</seg>
<seg id="273">The German reply to this question sent three invoices showing a total value of the delivered product of EUR 31 998, i.e. an amount equal to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxable person and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="274">According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer submitted a subsequent VAT declaration for the taxation period July 2004 following repeated reminders from the FA in January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="275">With this declaration, the taxable person simultaneously claimed his right to deduct VAT. His tax liability for the tax period in question therefore remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures concerning the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial administrations in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including: subsequent VAT fixing or prevention of VAT refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Examination of selected cases of risk-bearing intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET may be a major source of information to identify vulnerable taxpayers in the Member State of acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is verified by the competent FA with the acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has introduced into the EUROCANET system information on transactions and taxable suppliers deemed to be at risk.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,</seg>
<seg id="283">entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="284">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German financial administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with German VAT identification number were classified as risk-bearing by the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit identified both normal transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">In the cases concerned, they exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003,</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• During the verification of the early warning information, ZF did not detect any suspicion of high-risk sales.</seg>
<seg id="290">The taxpayers concerned were constantly monitored because their data were stored in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• Under the audits of high-risk transactions, they failed to demonstrate infringements of the rules for calculating the taxable amount and the VAT on the basis of the accounting documents provided, even though they detected inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or in business relations with mail box companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with and could not be contacted by the ESA.</seg>
<seg id="293">Most of the risky taxpayers and transactions referred to in EUROCANET's early warning reports were checked by the competent tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="294">However, their possibilities for checking high-risk revenues, especially "missing traders," are limited.</seg>
<seg id="295">In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly prove the fraudulent conduct of the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="296">Stricter registration requirements for taxpayers for the purposes of VAT and greater flexibility in cancelling registrations would be helpful in combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="297">The taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for purposes of the VAT in order to fake notional deliveries of goods throughout the EU or to formally issue correct tax documents to other taxpayers with which they then claim unauthorised claims for deduction.</seg>
<seg id="298">In the case of suspected carousel fraud involving imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely to monitor the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="299">Member States may participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three major Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Findings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The Federal Court of Auditors evaluated data available from EUROCANET at the Federal Central Office for Taxes, including data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">They served as a basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="304">Both Germany and a number of other countries refused active participation in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not itself send data to Brussels, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal Government</seg>
<seg id="307">no unquestionable legal basis [exists] which would allow the tax secrecy in Germany to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Federal Government has no reliable knowledge of how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET. "12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Office for Taxation has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the Federal and State financial authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German companies receive control notifications concerning the direct business relations of taxpayers registered with them with companies from other EU countries recorded in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the respective German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the above-mentioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company established in another Member State, which is also in business contact with the German company from the Control Communication.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory for other Member States to refuse active participation.</seg>
<seg id="314">Accordingly, the test had to be carried out differently in this area.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, significant differences in the success of the detection of VAT fraud could not be ascertained. This is because EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, the financial administrations of both countries have a large number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13 establishing EUROFISC, a network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared between Member States at European level and integrated into this network.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">The cases brought to justice at national and European level demonstrate the need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for exempting intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:</seg>
<seg id="324">Council Directive 76/308/EWG on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">Council Directive 2001/44/EG amending Council Directive 76/308/EWG on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, levies and customs duties and on value added tax and certain excise duties; and</seg>
<seg id="326">the directive in 2002 / 94 / the EC of the commission to the definition of detailed implementing regulations to definite articles of the directive 76 / 308 / EEC about the mutual support with the recovery of demands in connection with certain deliveries, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">The CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308/EWG by Law No 252/2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of the Council Directive 2001/44/EG, it had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, it was necessary to amend the aforementioned law.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, Law No 191/2004 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new relevant legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Annexes to this Regulation shall contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the Regulation makes electronic transmission compulsory and requires the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the respective original.</seg>
<seg id="332">Key principles of international assistance for the recovery of claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. The principle of reciprocity applies;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. Assistance must always be provided only on request and in the event of fulfilment of all conditions;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. Assistance shall not cover claims deemed to be criminal penalties in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. The intergovernmental assistance procedure for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. Assistance shall be provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. The principle of exhaustion shall apply: the requesting State shall use all resources available to it under national law to recover the claim.</seg>
<seg id="340">Law No 191/2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: provision of information, service of legal acts and actual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="341">Outbound request procedures for other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The competent FA shall transmit electronically to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ the request for information, the request for notification of acts or the request for recovery, together with the instruments concerned, through the respective Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall arrange the translation of the request into the relevant language, scan it with all installations and transmit it via the communication network or CCN/CSI common interface to the competent financial authority of the State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="344">A request for recovery assistance must meet the following condition: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not exceed five years of age.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedures for in-depth requests from other Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">The receipt of requests from other Member States shall be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance of the CZ as soon as possible, within seven days at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">If it decides not to accept the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the grounds for refusal, giving the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="349">Such notification shall be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance shall examine whether the request meets all legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="351">It will then submit the request to the competent FA through the Financial Directorate concerned. If the recovery request is accepted, the FA shall, inter alia, determine the debtor's assets, e.g. by extracts from the land register, inquiry into existing bank accounts and registration of motor vehicles with the registration body.</seg>
<seg id="352">At the end of six months from the date of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigations carried out.</seg>
<seg id="353">The requesting authority shall also be informed if the taxpayers concerned cannot be reached and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="354">All successfully recovered sums shall be transferred to the applicant authority within one month of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech FA concerned with recovery may, with the agreement of the requesting State, agree on the claim for hours or instalments.</seg>
<seg id="356">Interest or surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of delay pursuant to Law No 337/1992 on the management of taxes and fees</seg>
<seg id="357">shall be the responsibility of the requesting State.</seg>
<seg id="358">In particular in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance delayed sending to the competent FA the recovery requests received.</seg>
<seg id="359">The same applies to the forwarding to the competent authority in the requested State of the recovery requests submitted by the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit showed that the Ministry of Finance violated the Law on Intergovernmental Assistance for the Recovery of Claims. It failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="361">The situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">Pursuant to § 13 (4) of Law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ compiles statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This contains the number of requests for information, notification and recovery submitted in the previous year, including the amount of the respective claims.</seg>
<seg id="364">On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission shall prepare its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit showed that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the CZ reported the claims by EUR 5 250 000 too low. The reason was the incorrect indication of the amount of a VAT claim introduced in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech kroner to euro).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>

<seg id="368">4.4.2 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is Council Directive 2008/55/EG of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178/2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In order to improve legibility and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codified the Council Directive 76/308/EWG of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">It covers, inter alia, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and wealth, including interest, fees and surcharges.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.</seg>

<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Financial Authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Office for Taxpayers18.</seg>
<seg id="378">The general conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery aid are:</seg>
<seg id="379">• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (§ § 251, 254 AO).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All domestic recovery funds have been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• The claims for which mutual assistance is requested are indisputable.</seg>
<seg id="382">• The period between the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became indisputable and the date of the request shall not exceed five years.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The claim must be at least EUR 1 500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedures for outbound requests to other EU Member States The German requests for the recovery of backbound taxes are forwarded by the enforcement authorities to the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO, via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Office for Taxes.</seg>

<seg id="402">4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases</seg>
<seg id="403">A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between the CZ and Germany were selected for the audit. The following are 10 cases in which, inter alia:</seg>
<seg id="404">The following was found:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of VAT owed by a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 in the total amount of EUR 3,883 (109,820 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="407">Only on 26 February 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a pledge.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since the encumbered land was not sufficient to pay the entire tax liability, an instalment payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was reached with the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="410">An interim report was sent to the German FA on 31 August 2009. In the meantime, the taxpayer had settled tax liabilities of CZK 49 600 (as at 25 August 2009).</seg>
<seg id="411">The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on 28 August 2009, a further 3 000 CZK were transferred.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery request for tax liabilities (VAT, income tax) and interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling EUR 180 869 (= CZK 4 434 915).</seg>
<seg id="414">Only on 27 November 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="415">After checking the bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have pledgeable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Investigations on the ground also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">The Czech Ministry of Finance received this communication on 6 April 2009 and forwarded it to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT plus interest and fees totalling EUR 3 139 (= CZK 84 846).</seg>
<seg id="421">Only on 6 August 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now paid the debt.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully settled his debt in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the debt was also settled in the CZ under the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Because of the long time it took for the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the Bundesrechnungshof, it was found that the amount recovered is offset against the tax liability from another proceeding, which amounts to EUR 6 649 and was to be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only a request for recovery of EUR 3 139 for the company concerned. The recovery request of EUR 6 649 was not found there.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling EUR 39 957 = CZK 956 654.</seg>
<seg id="429">Only on 19 December 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="430">The recovery procedure was initiated on 1 June 2009. A decision was taken to attach the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (7,000 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor disagreed with the amount of the tax liability and declared the amount disputed.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros a month in the past, but the German FA did not agree.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxpayer agreed to discuss his case with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax for 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling EUR 113 444 = CZK 3 116 304.</seg>
<seg id="437">It was not until 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the Prague 1 FA, which is empowered to deal with tax cases of taxable persons not established in the CZ; a local FA could not be determined on the basis of the available address.</seg>
<seg id="438">During its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008 stating that the debtor's income was EUR 4 704. However, it could not issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to attach the debtor's assets to credit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of a VAT debt, together with legal costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.</seg>
<seg id="443">Only on 13 May 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA transferred to the Czech authorities, through the Bundesbank, the amount of EUR 17 700 = CZK 439 226, recovered by attachment.</seg>
<seg id="445">A conversion error was detected during the verification of the amounts recovered.</seg>
<seg id="446">The recoverable amount of 146 223 742 CZK was converted at the exchange rate of EUR 1 = CZK 25,065, but a comma error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The amount to be recovered was EUR 5 833 782.</seg>
<seg id="448">Consequently, a recovery request of EUR 5 250 404 was too low.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery for a VAT debt plus interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.</seg>
<seg id="451">Only on 10 November 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="452">The German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.</seg>
<seg id="453">Taking into account the significant reduction in the Company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability. Euro 8 on 2009,-,4,600 April, Euro 6 on 2009,-3,000 May and Euro 16 on 2009,-,2,500 June.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax liabilities totalling EUR 398 653 = CZK 9 832 779; included, inter alia, real estate tax.</seg>
<seg id="458">Only on 2 October 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="459">In a letter from the German Finance Administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009, the request was returned.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration justified this on the ground that the real estate tax was not 2008/55/EG for the purposes of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of the Directive.</seg>
<seg id="461">In addition, Article 2 (g) concerns liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55/EG applies to taxes on income and assets not referred to in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799/EWG.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new request for recovery to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the basic acquisition tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but the arrears of the VAT, corporation and income tax.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax liabilities of the same taxable person amounting to CZK 7 079 735.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328.</seg>
<seg id="467">The VAT debt was CZK 1 133 967.</seg>
<seg id="468">Only on 18 April 2007 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration</seg>
<seg id="469">and only on 11 November 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech Financial Administration's reply of 9 July 2007,</seg>
<seg id="470">According to which, on 11 June 2007, the German FA issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account. The Bank stated that it was not in any business relationship with that taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="471">The request was therefore deemed to have been completed for the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery of VAT debt totalling CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The Finance Directorate responsible sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German financial administration on 15 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before submitting the request, the Czech FA enforced the tax claim by attachment of the accounts in the case of banks and wages and by debiting a property.</seg>
<seg id="477">Before the request for recovery, a request for information was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">According to the reply of 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities of EUR 8 437. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the recovery request and did not forward it to the competent Czech FA until 12 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="479">According to the applicant, the tax liability in Germany is not recoverable due to the insolvency of the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="480">No property was found and the income from non-self-employed activities was already the subject of other enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German financial administration therefore considered the request to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">When recovering, all EU Member States apply the requirements of EU law for intergovernmental assistance.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The Federal Court of Auditors and NKÚ compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">There were inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States compile their statistics with greater care.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite the increased number of requests for assistance, the inconsistencies in the statistics had decreased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both Court of Auditors consider a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics to be useful in order to avoid the remaining inconsistencies in the future.</seg>
<seg id="490">If this is not done, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="491">Furthermore, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics reflect both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of sums recovered per Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics submitted by Member States, the Commission could assist Member States in assessing their measures to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">As the recovery rate per Member State can be calculated, the Court of Auditors argues that Member States with a low rate should aim at at least the average recovery rate within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.</seg>
<seg id="495">The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were delayed in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="496">The same applies to the recovery requests submitted by the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The examination showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance infringed Law No 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance in so far as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of recovery measures within the six-month period from the date of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 VAT check for large enterprises</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 VAT auditing at large companies in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">Universal</seg>
<seg id="501">The taxation procedure for large businesses is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="502">The audit of large enterprises is regulated by Czech Law No. 337/1992, the "Tax and Fee Administration Act."</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been set up to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the tax period in question is at least CZK 2 billion according to the income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="504">the taxable person is classified as a large holding on the basis of the turnover amount according to income or corporation tax return during the respective taxation period; for the first time in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A natural or legal person shall no longer be managed as a large holding for the purposes of turnover taxation if its net turnover during the taxation period is less than CZK 2 billion over three consecutive assessment periods. The deadline begins at the end of the taxation period for which the conditions were met for the first time according to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="506">A taxable person may be removed from the list of large enterprises only if at least one type of tax has been examined beforehand for a period of taxation.</seg>
<seg id="507">By the end of 2009, all large enterprises were audited at least every five years.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their adverse effects on the proper determination and collection of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="509">The tests carried out by the EU should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="510">The large-scale taxable holdings have been audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent firm set up at a total of 13 CET.</seg>
<seg id="511">A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the requirements of the Head of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition, she also checked</seg>
<seg id="513">taxable persons with unusual and special business activities; and</seg>
<seg id="514">those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.</seg>
<seg id="515">Taxpayers with complex location distribution and organizational structure are also examined.</seg>
<seg id="516">Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion</seg>
<seg id="517">and taxable persons belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified deduction.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information on the number of audits carried out by the Special Audit Bodies and the additional tax results of these audits are given in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No 531/1990 for regional financial authorities. In particular, the establishment of a special tax office with national jurisdiction for selected taxpayers (legal persons established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least. CZK 2 billion).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 VAT check at large companies in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">Universal</seg>
<seg id="522">The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. For audits, the general rules • the Tax Code (AO), • the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and • the Audit Code (BpO) apply.</seg>
<seg id="523">There are also work aids.</seg>
<seg id="524">Abgabenordung</seg>
<seg id="525">The provisions of § § 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 - External Examination" contain in particular rules on the admissibility of an external examination and its factual scope, distribution of competence, the form and content of the audit notice, the principles of examination, the obligations of the taxpayer to cooperate and the requirements for final interviews as well as for the review report.</seg>
<seg id="526">External audits are carried out by the competent ZF (§ 195 AO).</seg>
<seg id="527">Finance Administration Act According to § 5 paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with § 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Office for Taxes to participate in external audits of the Federal Ministry of Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and scope of this participation will be agreed between the authorities involved.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Office for Taxation may require that certain establishments it names are audited at a specific time.</seg>
<seg id="530">In this case, it may lay down rules for the external examination of those taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="531">Audit Regulations In accordance with Article 108 (7) GG, the Audit Regulations (BpO 2000) were adopted with the approval of the Federal Council.</seg>
<seg id="532">It applies to external audits of the Federal Tax Authorities and the Federal Central Office for Taxes.</seg>
<seg id="533">According to § 3 BpO, companies are regularly classified in size classes.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large-scale enterprises must be subjected to a connection test (cf. 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">In accordance with section 33.1 BpO, each competent financial authority must maintain a Group list within the meaning of the provision.</seg>
<seg id="536">Administrative Tools</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the following work aids were issued for the administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">• "Uniform manual for the special VAT test";</seg>
<seg id="539">• VAT-country online - USLO (= dialogue system in intra-Community VAT control procedure) with guidance on how to use the data contained in MIAS on intra-Community business relations;</seg>
<seg id="540">• Working aids for difficult and special situations.</seg>
<seg id="541">• Central database for the storage and evaluation of VAT fraud cases and the development of risk profiles - SPELL;</seg>
<seg id="542">Taxpayers are classified in size classes. These are based on criteria such as turnover and profit, the limit values being different depending on the business sector.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">The values shall be reviewed every three years and fixed for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of enterprises - not only large enterprises - is regularly recorded (last reporting date: 1 January 2010).</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, large enterprises must be inspected without gaps.</seg>
<seg id="547">The audits are announced and usually cover the VAT,</seg>
<seg id="548">d. that is, the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income and corporation tax as well as business and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT can be checked either by auditors or VAT special auditors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of each country.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">The BpO 2000 assumes three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">The audit shall be subject to all taxes on which an entity has been assessed.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of VAT auditing at large companies</seg>
<seg id="555">According to the agreement, both auditors did not check individual cases. They examined the question of how financial administrations conduct VAT audits of large enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="556">By means of a questionnaire, they collected information from financial administrations which is essential for the audit of large enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="557">• Which statistical records and evaluations for the VAT testing of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there statistics or records as to the extent to which a distinction is made between VAT fraud control and general VAT testing?</seg>
<seg id="560">CZ: No, the current version of the system ATIS does not allow such a distinction.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there statistics or records about the timeliness of the tests?</seg>
<seg id="563">CZ: Information on the timeliness of intra-Community purchases of selected VAT payers is recorded in the ATIS system;</seg>
<seg id="564">the same applies to information on the start and end of the FA audit.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the statistics for auditors summarized at federal level contain only information about the so-called average last audit period (year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not provide an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT special auditors concentrate on the last VAT assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large holdings.</seg>
<seg id="568">The federal statistics for VAT special auditors do not contain information on the size class of the audited establishment.</seg>
<seg id="569">• Are there statistics or records of the type of extra result; For example, divided by:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. real extra result (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general rate of VAT)</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. incorrect additional result (e.g. relocation/postponement of a situation not subject to VAT law into another taxation period)</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. Cash effectiveness (payment of fixed additional income)</seg>
<seg id="573">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech Financial Administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of additional tax income broken down by type of tax, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, reminder procedures) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Irrespective of this, the amount of additional payments and the receipts of payments are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics on tax liabilities are kept by type of tax. However, there is no distinction between tax liabilities arising from a tax return and those arising from auditing activities carried out by the FA.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the statistics summarized at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not differ according to the above criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Most of the financial authorities where local surveys were carried out also did not differentiate in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are results-relevant test fields recorded?</seg>
<seg id="581">CZ: Yes, the FA can select audit cases based on criteria associated with selected identifiers stored in the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="585">According to this, country auditors and tax inspectors must enter the tax surplus obtained by them in SPELLS if a certain threshold is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, additional information shall be provided, such as the origin of the additional VAT result obtained.</seg>
<seg id="587">• Which are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="589">- taxable large enterprises have unjustifiably used VAT deductions for supplies and services received,</seg>
<seg id="590">• which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity pursuant to § 72 (1) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which were used for representation expenses in accordance with § 75 (3) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="592">• based on invoices which do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG</seg>
<seg id="593">- large taxable enterprises have failed to notify VAT payable under § 21 (1) CZ UStG.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="596">Findings on VAT from audits of large enterprises are not recorded separately by the countries.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, the Federal Central Office for Taxation can evaluate the SPELL database into which state auditors and tax inspectors have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold value is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does financial management analyze audit fields that are significant in terms of results and draw consequences for strategic control?</seg>
<seg id="599">CZ: Yes, for example, country-wide audits are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide any information on particularly "productive" test fields.</seg>
<seg id="602">With regard to the analysis of such information, the benefits and the way in which it is used further, there were different views among the survey bodies.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some Senior Finance Directorates make such information available to the EU, but they are free to use it or not.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">As a result, it should be noted that large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. For example, data from VAT audits as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss statements are processed in the system.</seg>
<seg id="606">The CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases based on a wide range of information.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT tests in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In the CZ, the establishment of a Special Finance Office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparably large amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="610">Accordingly, it is more difficult to carry out these tasks in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="611">The emphasis is on the selection of specific cases.</seg>
<seg id="612">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of the data in VAT pre-filings or VAT declarations as well as test instructions, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.</seg>
<seg id="614">In order to reduce revenue losses at the VAT and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs, appropriate management processes and risk management systems should be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="615">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="616">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation between the two Court of Auditors has proved its worth.</seg>
<seg id="619">Thus, necessary insights could be gained on the systems applied in both countries: This concerns in particular: • Intra-Community turnover, • Risk management at the VAT in particular with regard to the selection of risk-related turnover, • Recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT audit of large enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="620">The audit disclosed differences in the strategies for detecting VAT fraud and the systems explained above.</seg>
<seg id="621">These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="622">They can also be used to stimulate discussion among interested parties as to which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud. This applies, for example, to the relationship between Member States and the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The experience and insights gained should encourage us to continue to examine the management of the VAT together.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Kommunique</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the presidents of the Czech Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="626">Status of information: June 2010.</seg>
