<seg id="6">It requires a high level of organizational, technical and financial efforts.</seg>
<seg id="7">When establishing and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises with European and national policy objectives often have to be made, such as the preservation of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially because of the necessary environmental protection measures, the construction of the transport infrastructure is complex.</seg>
<seg id="9">When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify deficiencies that prevent an Optimum level of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also make suggestions for improvement for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (Nkú), carried out parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and a 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The two highways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the course of its cooperation with the BRH, the NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the Planning Progress, the date of completion was finally set for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the procurement procedure, the road and motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor ensured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint examination activity, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the Bridges was the size of the bridge area.</seg>
<seg id="24">A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square meter.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis showed that the border bridge, the most expensive was among the large bridges with lengths of about 100 m.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was also due to the price increase resulting from the delays in the award.</seg>
<seg id="27">The comparison of the prices of the tunnel structures showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both BRH and NKÚ can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices for future checks on the cost - effectiveness of transport infrastructure spending.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both courts recommend to standardize bridge constructions and to carry out steel composite and special constructions only where prestressed concrete constructions are inexpedient.</seg>
<seg id="30">The examination process was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of this report is the parallel testing of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and a 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The focus of the examination was on economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of funds.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel tests were conducted by the BRH in Germany and the Nkú in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="36">in 2005 and 2006 by.</seg>
<seg id="37">The NKÚ tested the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure for the near-border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway amounting to approx. 20 billion CZK gross (approx. 690 million €).</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, € 64 million will be made available from EU structural funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">The BRH had independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005 already examined the planning and construction of the motorway a 17.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of approx.€ 670 million, € 277 million will be co-financed by European funds (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the pan – European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - central and South – Eastern Europe-Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,</seg>
<seg id="43">the A 17 from the border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the test, the sections of the motorways near the border were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">Here the crossing of a protected landscape area in the bohemian low mountains is planned.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the traffic volume in 2008 in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will amount to 22 940 cars per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 20%. 25 000 cars per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded an agreement on the merger of the German a 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border by establishing a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since both States are involved in the construction of this bridge, this single construction project, an important aspect of the parallel audits of both SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="53">From the middle of 2005, the two audit offices made joint considerations for cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany partly finances the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech road administration.</seg>
<seg id="58">There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The NKÚ did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly in view of the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The NKÚ also had to check the effectiveness of the expenditure. For this purpose, the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels should be examined, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">After preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courts of auditors concluded an agreement on the Coordination of inspections of the Prague – Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006. </seg>
<seg id="64">In the course of 2006, the auditors of both audit courts met at approximately six to eight-week intervals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for the examination of bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged examination results for the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">Essential to the cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH focused primarily on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs, and thus also the way in which the two audit offices complete their audits.</seg>
<seg id="69">For this reason, both authorities prepared separate national reports on their examination results.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the Treaty of 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.</seg>
<seg id="74">Later they postponed the date until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as the client of the construction project.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany is co-financing 42.13% of the bridge construction.</seg>
<seg id="77">Initially, the RMD envisaged a prestressed concrete construction for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, however, the RMD agreed with its German Partner on the construction of a steel composite structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">They based this decision on the possible reduction of the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated ecological benefits for the valley floodplain.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had indicated the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, this was due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,</seg>
<seg id="83">however, it is actually 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the procurement procedure, the RMD made serious errors,</seg>
<seg id="85">by insufficiently preparing the procurement documents and inaccurately describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.</seg>
<seg id="86">These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the evaluation commission and the Director General of the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="87">An unsuccessful bidder contested the outcome of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation by the Czech cartel authority, delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a result, the following summer construction season following the Tender Review was lost in 2004 and the available total construction time was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in less time. This led to a significant price increase.</seg>
<seg id="91">The measures offered included the double Assembly of the superstructures, the modification of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally intended steel grade.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new steel grade - the higher costs of approx. The client alone contributed € 4 million - making it possible to shorten the construction time planned for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the offer price of approx. The total construction costs of the border bridge will increase significantly by € 18.3 million net as a result of the acceleration measures and other additions.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">The costs are currently approx. € 25.9 million net (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both courts examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterized by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="99">The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways a 71, a 38 and a 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="101">When preparing this part of the exam, a precise definition of the price term was important.</seg>
<seg id="102">For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts agreed on detailed specifications, such as: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="103">(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change.), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion. (29 CZK = 1€).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of different types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and of different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.</seg>
<seg id="106">The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">Concrete bridges were by far the most common on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The study focused on this type of bridge because the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The investigation showed that the m2-price of concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface area): the bigger the bridge, the lower the square metre price.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see figures below).</seg>
<seg id="111">On the A 17, two bridges and on the D 8 four bridges with a significantly increased price could be identified.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges were determined partly by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between Bridge price and size (atypical expensive bridges can be identified based on the distance to the regression curve).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, the atypical high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw final conclusions, the causes for the respective high price have to be determined in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">This could be due, for example, to uneconomical administrative action, but also to the requirements for the protection of the environment or other legitimate reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Taking into account the greater average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to Germans (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between Bridge price and length led to the expectation that Czech concrete bridges would be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">In addition, labour costs in the Czech Republic were lower than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">During joint discussions, two causes for this situation were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="122">This also enables medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.</seg>
<seg id="124">Orders of this size cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge structures built is greater than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the NKÚ noted that the construction of Bridges is determined long before construction begins,</seg>
<seg id="128">this was already the case when the RMD submitted the application for planning approval.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this time, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, economic efficiency plays a minor role in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">Only by means of a thorough analysis of the construction industries of both countries would a final conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany have been possible. However, this would have blown up the scope of this examination.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">A comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany revealed no significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The significant price differences may result from underdeveloped competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow any generalizing conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden – Prague motorway</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the highway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">It was planned to gradually extend the D 8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">The section 0805 through the bohemian central mountains was to be built in front of the border section 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic finances the D 8 within the framework of the programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the program number 327 220 “construction of highway D 8 Prague – Ústí nad Labem – Czech-German state border” defined two objectives :</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">as a national goal: to improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the pan-European transport corridor IV Berlin-Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="147">The plan was to complete the construction of the section through the bohemian Highlands in June 2008 and the construction of the section near the border 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the date of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The NKÚ determined that the planning decision had already been issued for the construction of the section leading through the bohemian uplands.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental associations have appealed against this decision.</seg>
<seg id="151">A final judgment is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="152">Compared to the schedule provided for in the program documentation, a delay of several years in the completion of Section no.0805 could not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of the construction section No. 0805 for the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">In the years 1999 to 2001, the RMD carried out an economic assessment of the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 and Section No. 0805 through the bohemian uplands.</seg>
<seg id="156">As investment costs, it set approx. € 639 million for both sections no. 0805, and no. 0807 of.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: results of the profitability analysis ( EIRR = internal rate of return)</seg>
<seg id="158">Variant opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 22 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic feasibility study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section through the bohemian central mountains will be subject to traffic at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the examination it was obvious that the section through the bohemian uplands would not be opened at the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The costs of both sections were € 897 million excluding VAT as at 31.12.2005, 27.4% higher than in the profitability analysis of 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different, more complex course of action, which would affect the profitability of the project.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22 940 cars per day.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, a study on diversion routes as an Alternative to the missing section through the bohemian central mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12,600 to 13,750 cars per day in 2007. The project is then below the profitability limit.</seg>
<seg id="171">A higher volume of traffic on the routes intended to replace the missing section with the bohemian Uplands is highly likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the border section of the D 8 is, therefore, uneconomical.</seg>
<seg id="174">Also with the construction of the A 17 there were cost increases as with the construction of the two above mentioned sections of the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment for the federal transport infrastructure plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for Transport assumed investment costs of approx. € 320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">Thus, it determined a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">Meanwhile, the costs have increased to approx. € 670 million and reduced the benefit/cost ratio by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">The BRH had independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005 the economics of the planning and construction of the motorway a 17 examined.</seg>
<seg id="179">He noted that the authority responsible for the permit requested an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the superfluity of the landscape tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="181">As a result, € 10 million in construction costs and € 150,000 in annual operating costs could be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="182">During the examination of the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was insufficiently prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">In the planning phase, the road administration did not measure the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschen wall, as it was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">Only when the tunnelling reached the wall did it catch up.</seg>
<seg id="186">This showed that the Rock was more weathered than was assumed in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">Elaborate measures such as anchorages, injections and rockfall protection nets for around€ 3.3 million were necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional, already required eistungen such as securing the Dölzschener wall, but also for those, which would not have been necessary at all with a perfect construction preparation.</seg>
<seg id="189">This includes expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the tunnelling team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of construction time (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">These additional expenditures of around € 10.7 million do not represent any lasting added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to exercise better the technical supervision for major road construction measures which was incumbent upon it.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, it should urge that road construction administrations introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Advantages of the cooperation for BRH and NKÚ the cooperation fulfilled the expectations of both courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both audit offices developed a database on Bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.</seg>
<seg id="196">The NKÚ found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and carriageway of the D 8 did not differ from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of both audit offices involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience that will be of use in future audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Preface</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the courts of auditors are empowered to audit all public finances.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration requires that the courts of auditors have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The organisation of European supreme audit institutions (EUROSAI) regards taxes as an important component of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thematic focus of the sixth EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the court of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the most important steps on the way to optimizing the audit activities of a court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for the audit of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.</seg>
<seg id="9">As the national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, a Situation may arise in which the National Audit offices can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit offices of other countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">As an example, the examination of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.</seg>
<seg id="11">Cooperation between the authorities is required in the fight against such crimes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Courts of auditors that audit in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea for an examination of the value added tax and the MIAS system originated at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the course of thorough preparation, the participating audit offices first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we selected the subjects for the examination planning.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing Problem and individual states (especially the EC member states) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.</seg>

<seg id="25">(CZ) the purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the field of Value Added Tax following the Integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter “EC”) with free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra - community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="26">(DE) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-community VAT control with a focus on administrative assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of the audit, vulnerabilities should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.</seg>
<seg id="28">VAT information exchange system the audits were carried out jointly by the court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("Nkú") and the Federal Audit Office ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006. </seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 on the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The period under review covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005. </seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel testing</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two accounting offices.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the focus on "information exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) no 1925/2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary declarations.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation regarding cross-border passenger transport by bus and the comparison of statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas::</seg>
<seg id="37">1) registration for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is exceeding the turnover threshold specified in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number valid only for domestic sales for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-community transactions, he must issue a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number., request.</seg>
<seg id="42">As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the regulations should be standardized within the EC (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) international passenger transport by bus.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus is VAT-free, but there is a right to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the transport service, insofar as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/ EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of Value Added Tax (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">Whereas in the Czech Republic taxable persons are required to submit VAT returns only for tax periods during the year (month or quarter), in Germany taxable persons (monthly or quarterly)</seg>
<seg id="49">Pre-registrations of sales tax and a declaration of sales tax after the end of the calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="50">In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany have to submit VAT pre-registrations electronically.</seg>
<seg id="51">The introduction of the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="52">4) Summary Messages.</seg>
<seg id="53">While taxpayers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the tax authorities (FÄ), German taxpayers have to submit the summary reports to CLO2.</seg>
<seg id="54">Accordingly, FAS in the Czech Republic have access to the information from the summary reports immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="55">The information from the summary reports is only available to German FÄ after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="56">To combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-community sales is needed as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="57">The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of sales and the update of MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="58">This would allow a timely examination of taxation in the member state of the acquirer (see 4.4), but only if all EC member states introduce the same deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of Information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">For incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor processing times.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of the requests for information received within the specified period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a constant monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two member states is to develop its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a member state alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC member states. Otherwise, scammers will choose the member state with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">Within the framework of the cooperation, the two audit offices examined selected cases of intra-community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="69">Of these, 31 cases were examined jointly by using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The court of auditors noted the following::</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the FA used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the taxpayers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or had not reported the purchase of goods in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the FA could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal regulations in the two member states.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the financial administration of another member state refused to provide the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="76">A number of cases have been uncovered in which taxpayers misrepresented sales in their summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the clerks (the FA) had to determine in these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Test procedure</seg>
<seg id="79">Examination procedure in the CR</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II – "state budget revenue" and the Territorial audit departments of Central Bohemia, North-West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audit bodies were: the Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The College of the NKÚ approved the examination findings on 23 April 2007.</seg>

<seg id="85">It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase, the actual testing began in the 4th quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">Apart from Interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was conducted in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files from the following FA were included in the audit:</seg>

<seg id="93">The examination results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two courts of auditors</seg>
<seg id="95">In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both audit courts took place.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the tax administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in the other country.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint Meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel examinations: 1.</seg>
<seg id="100">Registration of Taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">Cross - border passenger transport by bus – legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. international exchange of information, in particular the actions of tax officials in processing requests for information and reviewing selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>

<seg id="118">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months shall be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (section 94 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., with regard to VAT; hereinafter referred to as “Law No. 235/2004”).</seg>
<seg id="119">The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he or she has crossed the registration threshold.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxpayer if the latter has exceeded the application deadline for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct input tax must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other conditions specified in Law No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="122">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions set out in the law may voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="123">Upon receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer, the registration procedure according to Act No. 337/1992 begins.</seg>
<seg id="124">If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you must specify in your application the reference date from which you apply for registration as a VAT-liable person.</seg>
<seg id="125">The financial officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all attachments.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he shall request the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="127">If the tax officer has ascertained by verification that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notification of registration and the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="128">In the communication, the tax officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for VAT and the assessment period for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">The assessment period is the calendar quarter, unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="130">If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the tax officer of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The issue of a tax number in the registration certificate is always constitutive.</seg>
<seg id="133">The taxpayer is required to provide the tax number for all communications (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law No. 235/2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents)3.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax number contains the code " CZ " and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as this is determined by a special law. For legal entities, the general identification mark is the company identification number (according to the provisions of § 33 (12) of law no.337/1992).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite a request from the tax official, the locally competent tax official has to register him ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="137">A notification is also issued to the Taxable Person.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business receives a tax number for any type of tax on his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="139">This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the duty to register Value Added Tax, the tax officer may require that the taxpayer receive up to 10% of the proceeds of the taxable turnover that the person concerned has unlawfully effected without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person until the date on which the registration as a taxable person took place by order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount thus determined shall be considered as a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a person liable for VAT can be deleted for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="145">A taxpayer may request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) cancellation of registration ex officio (Section 106 (7) of Law No. 235/2004), if: (a) the taxpayer has not performed any service for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officer of the reasons for doing so; (B) the taxpayer has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235/2004; (C) the previous taxpayer no longer fulfils the requirements for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) taxable persons without legal domicile, Registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic a person who is registered for tax purposes in another member state and who does not have his legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or supplies in accordance with Section 108 of Act No. 235/2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes taxable upon the provision of the relevant service.</seg>
<seg id="148">At the latest on the day of the delivery in question, the customer must submit an application for registration with the Prague 1 company.</seg>
<seg id="149">In this application, he is obliged to provide all VAT ID numbers assigned to him in other member states or third countries. specify.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 company has to register him retroactively, as he became subject to VAT in accordance with Law No. 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the case of retroactive registration, the Prague 1 company must request proof (invoices or written explanations) from the entrepreneurs concerned for the proof of performance.</seg>
<seg id="152">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the Prague 1 company must request the presentation of the performance-based contract documents.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prag 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">According to the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is authorized to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on January 31 of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to submit tax applications or declarations and to pay tax. </seg>
<seg id="155">During the examination of the NKÚ, it turned out that if a tax return is submitted by Post with dispatch abroad on January 25, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for submitting a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA by January 31. </seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than January 31, it is no longer possible to cancel the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the relevant calendar year. </seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of taxpayers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">According to the provisions of the Tax Ordinance (§§ 137, 138 AO), every business must be registered with the municipality and/ or the competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">This registration must be made at the latest one month after commencement of business activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality forwards the application to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has commenced but has not been declared, it may also register the taxpayer ex officio retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">In Germany taxpayers, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register for Zwekke of the value added tax if they meet the requirements of § 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (Ustg).</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">Special FÄ are responsible for entrepreneurs resident abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, the CHEMNITZSÜD FA is responsible for those entrepreneurs who have their headquarters in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="167">A total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered as of 30 April 2004; 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered as of 1 March 2006.</seg>
<seg id="168">According to the findings of the BRH, this ABIL denied with special responsibilities, often the registration of so-called Bogus self-employed resident in the new mid. Eastern European member states of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed persons tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These (sham)self-employed persons do not fulfil the requirements for recognition as entrepreneurs as defined in § 2 UStG, since they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work performed.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the relevant FA and provide information on the company and the business carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a form that is binding for all FÄ in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either in special organisational units within the FA or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="174">With the help of this form, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual taxpayer before the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain specifications:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="179">The VAT-IdNr. is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxable person declares intra-community deliveries in his VAT pre-registrations or in his annual VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT-IdNr. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. on request (e.g. if he stops doing business), but only after processing all tax transactions (assessment of all financial years) or 2. if the financial administration determines that he no longer operates a business.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends. from the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO about the deletion of the VAT number, so that there the validity of the VAT ID number. at this time can be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the value added tax act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay any value added tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the subsequent value added tax did not exceed the amount of € 17,500 and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of € 50,000 in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although you do not have to pay any sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and submit an annual sales tax return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small business owner may declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration is binding for the following five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">He may then invoice the value added tax and deduct the input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (§22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The prerequisite for this is that you make exclusively tax-free sales and waive the input tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="192">The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices shall indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The Situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the exceeding of the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for internal German sales.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-community transactions, he must specifically allocate a VAT ID number. request.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both the NKÚ and the BRH noted that the German two-stage registration system in other member states such as the Czech Republic, which issues a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-community transactions, can lead to significant misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows a correct assessment of VAT for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">Since the different registration procedures lead to problems, the regulations for the whole EC should be standardized.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.</seg>
<seg id="208">This should be allocated by the federal Central Tax Office to each natural person after birth.</seg>
<seg id="209">This number is valid for life for natural persons resident in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business activity, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which is registered as a VAT ID number. serve.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the National Registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID number. give.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for managing the numbers has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">Cross-border passenger transport by bus</seg>
<seg id="214">Legal regulations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">According to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No. 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the transport of passengers between member states and between member states and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduct input tax. </seg>
<seg id="216">Exemption from Value Added Tax shall also apply where the carriage is carried out by persons registered as taxable persons in other member states or by foreigners taxable in the territory of the country.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return journey is considered a separate transport process.</seg>
<seg id="218">If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than cross-border passenger transport by bus, they are not obliged to register as liable to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">International passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT due to the act of accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (B). The cited body States in the wording:</seg>
<seg id="220">"For the purpose of applying Article 28(3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport until the condition of Article 28(4) of the directive is fulfilled or until the same exemption is applied by any of the present member states.“</seg>
<seg id="221">The legal regulations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected. </seg>
<seg id="223">Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (Bus)entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxable person travels through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany shall be deemed to be taxable transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="228">The latter registers it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus mentioned in the taxpayer's registration.</seg>
<seg id="229">The entrepreneur must indicate his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport service is provided for an entrepreneur resident in Germany, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT to the FA himself.</seg>
<seg id="232">In its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is referred to as" shifting the tax liability partnership " and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the correctness of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile control groups of customs check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each inspection, the mobile control groups send an inspection report to the FA responsible.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident taxable person may deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability specified in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the FA has doubts about the correctness of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the FA or may use the means of administrative assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may request assistance in accordance with council directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters for the verification of the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too costly in relation to the low revenue from VAT on taxable passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxpayer incurs disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.</seg>
<seg id="243">Accordingly, such an audit is to be expected to take more time than that of a resident taxpayer, although the audit is limited to passenger transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must not only accept the audit rights of his national tax administration, but also those of the other member states to the extent that he carries out passenger transport there.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, for each member state where only one passenger transport is carried out, the Taxable Person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms provided by the tax administrations of the EC member states concerned.</seg>
<seg id="246">Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border Passenger Transport Services leads to a disproportionately high administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation is different in the two states.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC member states as well as between member states and third countries is exempt from VAT under the act of accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route covered by German national territory.</seg>
<seg id="251">If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA in advance.</seg>
<seg id="252">This registers the taxable person who must declare the taxable portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.</seg>
<seg id="255">The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to administrative expenses.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member states – which collect VAT pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of Value Added Tax-have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue. </seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid the disproportionately high costs of assessment of Value Added Tax, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to taxation in one member state.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state in which the promotion begins or in which the service provider is located.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006. </seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">Unless the law provides otherwise, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit a VAT return on the form specified by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period, even if no tax liability has arisen.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax liability arises upon expiry of the deadline for submitting the VAT return. According to Law No. 235/2004, VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this provision. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If, as a result of an above-average deductible input tax, a claim for a refund is made, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of this input tax deduction, without any application having to be made.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit shall not be applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the taxpayer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">According to § 73 (11) of Law No. 235/2004, the right to deduct input tax can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax arose.</seg>
<seg id="267">After expiry of this period, the input tax deduction can still be asserted within three years after the end of the tax period in which the assertion would have been possible for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this requires the submission of a supplementary income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="269">An amendment to Act No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct input tax could have been claimed for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">A taxable person must submit a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax liability but only change previous information, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with Section 49 of Law No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">A taxable person may submit a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Taxable Person must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the relevant facts were established.</seg>
<seg id="273">The VAT return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.</seg>
<seg id="274">The submission via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.</seg>
<seg id="275">If it is made without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carriers.</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return form contains separate lines indicating the value of intra-community deliveries and purchases.</seg>
<seg id="277">The value of services purchased must be indicated in separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some sections are used for automated primary controls within the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of goods delivered to other EC member states to persons registered as taxable there is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary declarations.</seg>
<seg id="280">The value of purchases of goods from other member states from persons registered as taxable there is compared with the information contained in the summary declarations of taxable persons from other EC member states by means of the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="281">Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check of the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="282">This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility check includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">According to the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Act No. 337/1992, the FA May repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special Tax Act or a decision under this act.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system – automated tax information system used by Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="286">The NKÚ found during its examination that the FA rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxpayer concerned if the VAT return was not submitted.</seg>
<seg id="287">Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT returns and annual VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit advance VAT returns must nevertheless submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small business owners who are not obliged to pay VAT must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="291">The taxable persons are generally obliged to submit a VAT registration before the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the value added tax arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability in the previous year amounted to more than € 6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT registrations no later than the 10th day after the end of the respective month. </seg>
<seg id="293">The taxable person can also opt for the submission of prior monthly VAT registrations if he has received a refund of € 6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">If the annual value added tax has not been more than € 512, neither VAT registrations nor VAT returns are to be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="295">A resulting VAT liability must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="296">A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no (legal) deadlines for processing VAT returns and for refunding VAT overpayments.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount may be offered.</seg>
<seg id="299">In principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German Value Added Tax Act allows an extension of these (tax or payment)periods (§ 18 (6) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">If it is granted, the submission of sales tax pre-registrations and the corresponding payments may take place one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment is to be made.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment will be offset against the VAT liability determined for the December pre-registration period.</seg>
<seg id="304">If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no" supplementary " VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">If the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has once been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT registration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return. </seg>
<seg id="307">Corrections of this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was submitted.</seg>
<seg id="308">After the expiry of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of reckless tax reduction or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">The taxable persons must submit the VAT pre-registration by electronic means.</seg>
<seg id="310">The FA may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unfair hardships.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual VAT return can be submitted in paper form or via the internet with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If the tax is paid without certification, the taxpayer must also submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">If no advance VAT declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxable person6.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of late submission, the taxpayer may be subject to a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).</seg>
<seg id="315">In an earlier examination, the BRH found that Faes often do not charge this delay surcharge.</seg>
<seg id="316">In the cases where the FA collected the late surcharges, the determination of the amount was inconsistent and arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="317">The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, especially when submitting the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-community deliveries or purchases.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable sales must be indicated in a separate line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="321">The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data of electronically filed tax returns are immediately available to the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="323">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="324">After all data is collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.</seg>
<seg id="325">The sales tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible officer on the basis of the automatically generated audit notes (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the Taxable Person's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, taxpayers must file their pre-registration at the latest 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annual VAT return must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest. </seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by submitting a single VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">- If the Taxable Person corrects his information on intra-community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;</seg>
<seg id="335">- The federal states do not equalize MIAS data on intra-community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the annual VAT returns have usually been processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This tax obligation enables the German tax administration to verify compliance with the sales ceiling for small businesses.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the competent FA may reconcile the annual sales tax declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the Income Tax Return issued.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are obliged to submit VAT registration electronically.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary Messages</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary declarations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235/2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another member state is required to submit corresponding summary declarations (hereinafter referred to as “CM”).</seg>
<seg id="345">The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the CMM in Czech currency, broken down by VAT IdNr7, the individual taxable persons under whom they are registered in the other member state.</seg>
<seg id="346">Information on services is not provided in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="347">Taxpayers with a calendar month or quarterly tax period must submit the tax return to the local competent FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter. </seg>
<seg id="348">Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the finding of the error.</seg>
<seg id="349">Incorrect data in the ZM will always be replaced by the data from the correction ZM.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similar to tax returns, taxpayers can also submit the tax return electronically.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a taxpayer does not submit a tax return or correction tax return, even though he is obliged to do so under Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer must ask him to submit the relevant tax return, referring to the consequences of the non-tax return. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the tax officer is entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Act No. 337/1992.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Nkú found in its audit that the FA did not usually use their power to impose fines on their defaulting taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, taxpayers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations when submitting a tax return, as the failure to submit a tax return does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">According to § 102 (5) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the CMM or corrective CMM, to remove any ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In Case Of Non-Conformity</seg>
<seg id="356">8 of the information in the financial statements with which the taxpayer corrects incorrect information in the financial statements by submitting a corrective financial statement either on his own Initiative or upon request.</seg>
<seg id="357">The Financial Officer shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other member states in the ATIS system if::</seg>
<seg id="358">- the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the CMM (or correction CMM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction CMM,</seg>
<seg id="359">-the tax officer has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxable person in the CTM or correction CTM.</seg>
<seg id="360">Corrections entered by the tax officer, without a correction ZM from the taxpayer, do not replace the duty of the taxpayer to submit a correction zm, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from the CM will be forwarded to the member states concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only the National Tax Authority designated for cooperation with the other member states in the field of Value Added Tax may transmit and receive this data.</seg>
<seg id="363">This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of international administrative assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The message "O_MCTL" automatically receives the CLO from the other member states.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect USt-IdNr. which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the incorrect VAT-IdNr. used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry in the list of the wrong VAT ID number takes place.</seg>
<seg id="366">The list contains a " notification of doubts concerning USt-IdNr.“.</seg>
<seg id="367">The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the System.</seg>
<seg id="368">When purchasing goods from another member state, the Taxable Person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the acquisition in the designated lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech taxpayer in its VAT return and the values of the goods delivered by the supplier from the other member state in its VAT return shall be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="370">The clerks there must examine the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="371">Three different situations can then occur:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) the value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the supplies indicated by suppliers from other EC member states.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) the difference is zero.</seg>
<seg id="375">This Situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer in the meantime submits a supplementary VAT return on his own Initiative).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.</seg>
<seg id="377">( C) the value of goods acquired from other member states which the Czech taxpayer has declared in his VAT return is higher than the value of the goods delivered by the suppliers of the other EC member states.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here again, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="379">After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer enters the results of his review into ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">These results are forwarded to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of transactions sent by the CLO for audit is shown for the individual quarters of 2005 in Graph 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="382">Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO to the FA for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for Case Selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC member states.</seg>
<seg id="384">Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error of the domestic acquirer.</seg>
<seg id="385">There may also be an error by the taxable person in another member state or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries are indicated differently in the CM in the individual EC member states.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the FA audited are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-community deliveries from Germany to other EC member states or participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly ZM, in which the intra-community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question. </seg>
<seg id="390">If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of sales tax pre-registrations, this also applies to the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="391">The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">The electronic tax has been mandatory since 1 January 2007. </seg>
<seg id="393">The FA may allow exemptions for individual taxpayers to avoid unfair hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">If the taxpayer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a corrective ZM within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In case of non-submission of the ZM, the CLO initiates a coercive procedure.</seg>
<seg id="396">This includes the following steps: - first reminder-second reminder, connected with the threat that a penalty payment will be fixed and – fixing the penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German tax code allows a penalty payment of up to € 25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of € 125, € 250 and € 500 in three stages.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxpayer acts in an irregular manner if he intentionally or recklessly fails to deliver a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he fails to correct a ZM or not in time.</seg>
<seg id="399">This violation can be punished with a fine of up to € 5,000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-community deliveries cannot be entered by the FA into the MIAS, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for the processing of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="401">The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="402">The information from the summary messages is only available to FÄ after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The data of the ZM must be stored within three months after the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).</seg>
<seg id="405">In case of incorrect VAT-IdNr. in the ZM German Taxpayer, the German CLO receives a message "O_MCTL" of the other member state.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then his task to request the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="409">In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs have the VAT ID number. at the Request of the CLO, corrected.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, reminding and threatening and imposing up to three consecutive fines takes too much time if a taxpayer may be involved in a cross-border merry-go-round scam.</seg>
<seg id="411">The cases that were ultimately reported to the relevant FA were usually concluded within one to two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The relevant FA refused the tax exemption for the reported intra-community deliveries in 73% of these Cases9.</seg>
<seg id="413">The taxpayer submitted the correct VAT ID number. before, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FA cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the FA nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="415">Therefore, taxpayers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, no comparison of the information on goods deliveries made in the VAT pre-declarations or the VAT return with the corresponding information in the CTM takes place before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other member states.</seg>
<seg id="416">This comparison can only be made by the FA. This usually happens when preparing a VAT special audit.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data received from other member states will be processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT-IdNr. are recognised and reported to the member states concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data are used for the control of acquisition taxation in the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="420">As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with the data of previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control messages are created and transmitted to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="422">This happens continuously, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all VAT-liable persons is compiled later and forwarded to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="423">The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares these data with those for intra-community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">The System completely checks (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another member state must, within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter, submit a tax return to the local competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="427">The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of intra-community deliveries declared by the taxable persons in the CECs are compared with the values of intra-community deliveries declared by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the reconciliation are taken into account in the context of the tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly tax returns within the first 10 days of the following calendar Quarter10.</seg>
<seg id="431">Since 1 January 2007, taxpayers have had to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="432">The data from the ZM are only available to FÄ after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">In the Czech Republic as well as in Germany, the tax payers only state the deliveries of goods in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="434">The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German Fä cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.</seg>
<seg id="435">Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect USt-IdNr. even if the taxpayer does not correct the correct VAT ID number. to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax administration does not equalize the information on intra-community deliveries that German taxpayers provide in their VAT pre-registrations with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of the pre-registration and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other member states.</seg>
<seg id="438">Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="439">The data transmitted by other member states on the supply of goods to Czech taxpayers will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchase of goods which Czech taxpayers have indicated in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The Czech CLO carries out the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such general control is only carried out for taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-community acquisitions of other taxpayers only if the RMS has created an audit notice or the taxpayer has been selected for an audit anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves FA from clarifying the reasons for differences.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">To combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay could be reduced to up to four months if the taxpayers had to submit monthly tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly tax would only increase the bureaucratic burden immeasurably, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or pre – registrations anyway and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or pre –registrations.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the submission of VAT returns or pre –registrations.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, a duty to provide ZM on a monthly basis would create more periodic discrepancies between the data on intra-community deliveries and those on intra-community purchases and would increase the data flows between the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the Federal government considered the General introduction of monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="454">The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that monthly transmission of MIAS data to the CLO of other member states could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In order for the obligation to pay monthly fees to be effective, it is necessary to agree on a uniform monthly fee at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on goods deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total turnover of intra-community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both courts requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID number. in the O_MCTL messages exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual quarters audited.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data can be found in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">They have significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_mctl messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which the O_mctl message was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information at Level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">International exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information enables tax officials to obtain information from other member states on intra-community transactions and on the taxpayers who have carried them out.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of Value Added Tax, which repealed directive (EEC) no 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as “Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003”), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information (engl.: request for information RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their answers to a received RFI through the financial Directorate to the CLO. This ensures that the information provided in the standardised SCAC form is translated into the foreign language and forwarded to the other member states.</seg>
<seg id="471">In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other member states and answers to requests sent. It arranges their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FA for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period under review were audited by NKÚ.</seg>
<seg id="474">Out of the total number of 94 RFI received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the remaining one case, no answer had been sent to Germany until the Nkú had examined it. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this period and in 19 cases no reply had been received from Germany at the time of the Nkú's examination (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information on the basis of the information provided).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic were answered from Germany can be found in graph No. 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of intra-community sales reported in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information usually had values of more than € 60,000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="481">The tax officials of other member states are often provided with information without prior request that is important for determining the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, All information is collected at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The exchange of information between the individual member states takes place electronically.</seg>
<seg id="484">"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-determined information to other member states at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="485">"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to another member state without its prior request as soon as the relevant information becomes available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic shall inform the other member states in an automatic exchange of information about deliveries of new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="487">The tax officer receives this information from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to Section 19 of Law No. 235/2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data into the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, these data will be transmitted to the other member states within the specified period, namely no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Czech Republic also provides other member states with information on mail order transactions that are tax - free in the country of origin, on intra-community transactions that appear to be illegal and on potential "Missing Traders".</seg>
<seg id="490">This information is transmitted to the other member states by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, the initiative for information requests and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the locally responsible FA.</seg>
<seg id="493">The FA send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCACVordrucke to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the used SCACVordruck is one-way.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were submitted in order to ensure the taxation of acquisitions in the other member state or to demonstrate the tax exemption of intra-community deliveries from Germany to the other member state.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another member state, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of € 15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover that is below the minimum amount limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are neither written in German nor in English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To answer the request for information, the CLO forwards it to the FA responsible and refers to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">No further deadlines are set at the various levels of the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacities to remind FÄ to respond to the unfinished requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">Faes receive the required information by letter from the taxpayer or by carrying out an external audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the VAT special audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only relate to a recent transaction.</seg>
<seg id="504">With this short and flexible form of audit, an announcement to the taxpayer is not required and it has proven itself in the investigation of a single turnover.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the case of automatic exchange of Information, Germany shall transmit the following information to the other member state: – via VAT-IdNr., which have been allocated to undertakings established in other EC member states,-on the refund of input tax to entrepreneurs established in other EC member states.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC member states within the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information::</seg>
<seg id="507">a. The delivery of new vehicles to the entrepreneurs without VAT no., B. distance sales (mail order) to other EC member states which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c.significant differences between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other member states, d. intra-community deliveries of goods which have been subject to taxation in Germany by the taxable person incorrectly, e. potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-community transactions, regardless of whether their UStIdNr. is still valid or has already been deleted and F. taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries to potential "Missing traders" or to customers who have a VAT ID number. used abusively.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the Initiative of the local FA, who transmit the corresponding SCACVordrucke to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACVordrucke (Czech-English) and translates information given into English or German, the German FA follows the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the German financial administration only completed the requests for information addressed to Germany in 40.6% of the cases within that period. </seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO refers the FA to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.</seg>
<seg id="514">Due to the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of requests for information that are answered within a time limit.</seg>
<seg id="515">Therefore, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Situation has now changed.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities to respond to the outstanding requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT Risk Management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Czech Ministry of finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department for methodology and economic management of Value Added Tax and its risk management unit deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenues and evaluates the Trends in these risks in domestic and intra-community trade.</seg>
<seg id="523">At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of sales tax returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-community deliveries and acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares the concept of risk management in the field of Value Added Tax and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and other member states.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department for International administrative assistance in the field of Value Added Tax provides inter alia for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the system MIAS of other member states, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.</seg>

<seg id="530">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="531">The tax audit and tax enforcement methodology department carries out risk analyses within the framework of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be audited, creates risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Tax investigation agencies exist at the finance directorates. Its tasks include the search for taxpayers and industries that are at risk with regard to the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet business, Gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxpayers (e.g. in the sectors of internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of linkages in chain fraud cases and informing local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Special examination units were set up in 12 selected FA.</seg>
<seg id="534">These have a regional competence and carry out tax audits also outside the local area of competence of the FA on the basis of appropriate authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain transactions.</seg>
<seg id="536">These special units examine according to the needs of the tax investigation agencies or focus on taxpayers with certain activities, multinational companies and taxpayers with particularly high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for reducing VAT risks have been integrated into the ATIS system: – the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk – bearing nature of tax returns submitted; – the task of "selecting the taxable persons to be audited", selecting the taxable persons to be audited on the basis of certain criteria;-the task of "MIAS", which gives tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC member states.</seg>
<seg id="538">The task "MIAS" allows among other things the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT-IdNr. of Taxable persons from other member States, – confirmation of the value of the to a Czech Taxpayer supplied Goods, as specified in the ZM of all of the supplier of the Taxable person from other member States, – preparation of a list of Taxpayers that have not delivered the ZM, – formal control of the information, the Taxable person in the Czech Republic in your ZM have made before this information is transmitted to other member States, – preparation of a list of the Taxable person, in their VAT returns the data on deliveries of goods to other member States, not with the data in the ZM match, – creation of a list of Taxpayers in their VAT returns the data to the value of the other member States Goods purchased does not match the information in the ZM of all of your suppliers from other member States übereinstimmen13.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their duties to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from state authorities such as Commercial Registers, Land Registry, motor vehicle registers, trade register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 submission and processing of summary declarations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and implementation of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a complete uniform database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the CLO, unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "Kiss" – Coordination Office for VAT special audits and tax investigation measures) collects the audit findings on fraud cases in the Opus database.</seg>
<seg id="545">In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up during the kiss. There, the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="546">The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at the national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experiences of KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.</seg>
<seg id="549">The formal Review of the composition of signed for and on behalf. other member states that appear in the ZM German tax payers are carried out at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal review takes place before the CM is transmitted to other member states in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its benefits (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">Checking the validity in the ZM mentioned VAT-IdNr. done on the basis of the o_mctl identifiers transmitted by the other member states (for the procedure of correcting invalid VAT ID no. see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, CLO RMS relies on MIAS data provided by other member states and generates various types of notifications to detect suspected missing Traders. As a guide, certain features are used, which usually occur in Carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="553">The FA of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to forward the result of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.</seg>
<seg id="554">The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features must be taken into account in order to conclude with sufficient probability on a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).</seg>
<seg id="555">Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different indications when preparing the notifications.</seg>
<seg id="556">The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the payment behaviour of the taxpayer, the economic sector or the company's shareholding relationships.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of risk management exists in the federal states ' financial administrations and focuses on the processing of sales tax pre-registrations and annual declarations.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the System creates a list of those taxpayers who have indicated intra-community deliveries in their VAT registration or annual declaration.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions specified by the taxpayer in its annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as these would result in too many discrepancies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="562">- Supplier and Purchaser assume different times for the execution of intra-community turnover;</seg>
<seg id="563">– different accounting and tax Declaration of discounts and discounts.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing the information from the sales tax returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the sales tax returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owner/partner, number of employees and method of payment of the taxpayer).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which enables a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out.</seg>
<seg id="566">This System is used in the processing of VAT registrations by FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="567">This gives the competent FA the advice of the RMS before the value added tax is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this System is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FA.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of discovered evasion cases.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the features for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The system creates a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list, the competent FA decides on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.</seg>
<seg id="574">In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based Fuzzy System.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this Neuro-Fuzzy system (also called Datamining System) calculates how likely it is that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">On the basis of this list, the FA selects the relevant taxpayers for the examination and reports the examination results to the relevant data centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three systems for the fight against fraud seems to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will materialize during actual use.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although it is not possible in this report to address the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and BRH have noted that each member state has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">An exchange of experience is currently taking place between the tax authorities of the European member states on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud-has proven to be not a national but a European Problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several member states.</seg>
<seg id="587">A member state alone cannot develop an effective RMS.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC member state. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the member state with the weakest RMS for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="589">The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the member state in which the Initiator is based.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any other member state involved in the fraud may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">Therefore, there should be a European exchange of experience about the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected results from the examination of individual sales the nkú and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and sales in parallel tests.</seg>
<seg id="593">International exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two courts jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, about the execution of which there were doubts, or which the taxpayers of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, on the basis of information from the BRH, the NKÚ examined in 43 cases the values of intra-community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxpayers had stated in their tax returns and ZM.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="598">The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC member states lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth € 60,500 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only € 29,869, the Czech Tax Administration sent a request for information to Germany to check the value of the goods delivered.</seg>
<seg id="603">In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer in question had delivered goods to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004 to the value of € 27,381, in the third quarter to the value of € 31,997 and in the fourth quarter to the value of € 10,276. </seg>
<seg id="604">Furthermore, it emerged from the answer that the VAT-IdNr. of the German taxpayer was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application by the German taxpayer and the validity of the VAT ID no. retroactively to 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German Taxpayer corrected the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this Information, it was a (intra-community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="607">In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004, the Czech taxpayer had submitted supplementary VAT returns for the individual (annual) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other member states and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from purchases from other member states.</seg>
<seg id="608">On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared purchases also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="609">In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as liable for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, he did not have the allocation of a VAT ID number when registering., but only applied for a tax number that is exclusively valid for Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is usually not possible in Germany to provide a taxpayer with a VAT ID number retroactively. this was done in 2006 by the Responsible Officer of the German financial administration retroactively as of 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO shares a USt-IdNr. retroactively, if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer's request for a VAT ID number. manmade.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO issues the USt-IdNr. retroactive, because the entrepreneur according to § 6 UStG for an intra-community delivery no valid VAT-IdNr. requires.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number. of its supplier to declare the intra-community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these procedural differences between the member states, the German CLO granted the USt-IdNr. in this particular case retroactive.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested a review of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.</seg>
<seg id="618">From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the locally competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004. </seg>
<seg id="619">The German authorities stated in their reply that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons did not have a VAT ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005.  get assigned.</seg>
<seg id="620">The NKÚ learned from a request made to the local Czech tax official that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit on the Czech taxpayer for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">During this audit, the Tax Office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 that he had provided to the German taxpayer before its VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">The (Czech) tax office established a tax liability of CZK 1,880 against the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="623">On the basis of the Nkú's request, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had the VAT ID no. he was only assigned when he registered his company founded in 2004 with the FA on February 16, 2005. </seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from October 1, 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this VAT return, the taxable person stated intra-community acquisitions from the Czech Republic in the value of € 160 (approx.CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3.in his VAT return for September 2004 as well as in his tax return for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer stated deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="627">When checking the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS System, the Czech tax official stated that this registration was only valid from November 11, 2004, and thus after the delivery of goods to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech taxpayer submitted a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries to the value of CZK 114,615 and VAT of CZK 21,777, which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">Through a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently filed an application for resumption of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered since 1 January 2000. </seg>
<seg id="630">Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">From the German information it emerged that the German taxpayer only on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods a VAT ID no. had been assigned.</seg>
<seg id="632">As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request for resumption of tax proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH found that in this case no intra-community acquisition of goods had taken place, because the German taxpayer had not received a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004.  had received.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-community acquisition as well as the VAT on this and also demanded the refund of input taxes in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the German taxpayer's tax liability, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">Furthermore, the BRH found that the German taxpayer's company mentioned in the request for information was changed in Germany during the processing of the reply, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax official.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the acquisition of goods by a Czech taxpayer from a German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005, worth €22,686.</seg>
<seg id="640">Through a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had examined the Czech taxpayer during an external audit whether the intra-EU delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-EU acquisition in his VAT return because the German supplier did not provide his VAT ID number in the invoice. but only gave his tax number, which is intended for business within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">According to MIAS data, the German taxpayer is registered for VAT in connection with intra-community transactions only as of 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxpayer. </seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxpayer so that he could initiate the appropriate tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech FA considered this business as the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private)person in Germany and therefore did not set a Value Added Tax for the acquisition of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH found that under German law a taxpayer who delivers goods to other member states does not have a VAT ID number. for intra-community deliveries, in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only signed for and on behalf. of the purchaser in the other member state and can prove the Transport of the goods in question to the other member state.</seg>
<seg id="647">In this case, according to German tax law, turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-community delivery that should be subject to tax on acquisition in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-community transactions if these are below the minimum amount limit of € 15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth € 12,561 from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">As part of the Intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery of goods by means of an SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech taxpayer stated that he had not received the goods, that he had never been in business relations with the German company, and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of supporting documents – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – because the turnover was below € 15,000 and no other justification had been given.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documents for subsequent taxation of the acquired goods, the tax audit was fruitless and the original tax assessment was successful.</seg>
<seg id="656">On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as "fiscal Representative17" (§ 22 (A) – (e) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to tax exemption was recognized.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">In Section 4.6.1 it was shown that the answers of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers of the Czech financial administration:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. in its audit, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of goods delivered to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="662">In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxpayer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer to the value of € 86,307; however, the Czech taxpayer only declared the purchase of goods to the value of €35,314 in his VAT return for the same period.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005. </seg>
<seg id="664">Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7.in 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 to the value of € 1,265,554, with indications of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The NKÚ stated that at the time of its examination a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.</seg>
<seg id="667">Through a request to the local tax officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German taxpayer in the value of CZK 11,816,103.</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer submitted a corrected tax return.</seg>
<seg id="669">Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out at the German acquirer in Germany. It was determined that the purchase of all the motor vehicles in question had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were resold to other taxpayers in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. according to MIAS data, in the 4th quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car worth €48,500 from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="672">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="673">By asking the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Czech taxpayer did not submit any tax returns even after being requested by the tax official. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the value added tax liability at zero for the period October to December 2004. </seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the said delivery from the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official, the tax official sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the reply to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the end of the Nkú audit how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="678">Due to non-compliance with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxpayer was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005. </seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial answer was sent because at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth € 16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with indications of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he had only received invoices for deliveries worth € 16,335 issued by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="683">On the basis of the Nkú's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth € 16,335 twice in its VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10.in 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, that the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 be reviewed to the value of € 198,167, showing signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration submitted a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had acquired several motor vehicles and that, moreover, the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech taxpayer in order to verify the deduction of above-average input taxes.</seg>
<seg id="688">However, an unjustified claim was not established.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared in his VAT returns for the period in question the acquisition of goods from other member states with a total value of € 579,114, and that the examination of the German FA with the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier'S tax return.</seg>
<seg id="691">In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistencies or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-community delivery of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences.:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to MIAS data, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth € 35,716 from the German taxpayer, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official and there was no business activity at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax official requested verification of how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="695">The German response to the request for information revealed that according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarder.</seg>
<seg id="696">The total value of the order was 155,000 €, but the German taxpayer only supplied goods worth 21,659 €.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech tax payer sent the German taxpayer a false payment confirmation for the amount of € 155,153 in favor of the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After detection of the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech buyer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the delivered Material with the exception of a part worth 7,916€.</seg>
<seg id="699">Through a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the tax administration, on the basis of the information received from the Czech taxpayer, among other things, subsequently taxed the turnover of goods delivered from other member states in the amount of CZK 388,522.</seg>
<seg id="700">On the basis of a request from NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had reported only one delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth € 7,916 after corrections.</seg>
<seg id="701">In accordance with German law, the German taxpayer declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="702">His CMM contained the following information concerning the Czech taxpayer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the verification of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a Scacvordruck.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxpayer with goods with a total value of € 396,126 and provided services with a value of € 11,885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit on the Czech taxpayer in order to investigate this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the request for information, the Czech Tax Administration reported that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and installed a production plant to the German.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after May 1, 2004. </seg>
<seg id="709">The German taxpayer did not take off the assembled production plant and claimed defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German for the production plant for € 107,100 and € 11,885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German taxpayer received the invoices, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">By asking the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices had been properly recorded in the accounts of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="713">VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer relating to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH noted that, based on the response of the Czech tax administration, the local FA came to the conclusion that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxpayer to the German, including the assembly performed.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German recipient of the work delivery owes the value added tax in accordance with the German Value Added Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient can claim an input tax deduction of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">Since the VAT liability of the German taxpayer remained unchanged, the German FA did not require a correction of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. according to MIAS data, Czech taxpayer a purchased a machine worth € 58,000 from German taxpayer C in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany to verify this information.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that he had returned it to the German taxpayer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the German tax administration, the machine was not returned to Germany, but transported to the branch of the German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">The latter received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's branch in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">By asking the local tax officer responsible for taxpayer B, the NKÚ found that according to MIAS data, German taxpayer C had delivered goods (another machine) worth € 88,027 to the Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">Taxpayer B stated that he had not received the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">The answer was that the machine had been delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">In the course of further investigations at taxpayer B, the tax officer found that the machine, valued at € 88,027, had not been booked at taxpayer B and that it could be the same type of machine that the branch of German taxpayer C had delivered to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The NKÚ also noted that the Czech tax official responsible for taxpayer A had carried out an audit on the tax official.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax officer had at his disposal the invoice of the German Taxable Person C dated 7 February 2005, in which the Taxable Person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine. </seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax official noted that taxpayer A had not booked this invoice.</seg>
<seg id="733">Taxpayer A had concluded a lease agreement with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided the Transport.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of taxpayer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH found that the German taxpayer C had not delivered the machine worth € 88,027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxpayer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">Accordingly, there was no intra-community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the German tax - payer C's claim for VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German taxpayer d delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">Under German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">The BRH also noted that the German taxpayer C had stated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth € 58,000 to the Czech taxpayer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="743">The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005, the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-community deliveries of a German taxpayer worth € 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer. </seg>
<seg id="746">The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The German taxpayer had not carried out any active business activity since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit on the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="749">The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim by the German taxpayer against the German tax administration, which the Czech taxpayer had asserted to the German FA as a shareholder in the German company.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official has so far no Information that the German tax administration is handling the case with respect to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="751">From the information available, it appears that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to mention the intra-community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see also Section 4.4.1).):</seg>
<seg id="753">15.according to MIAS data, a German taxpayer supplied goods with a total value of €33,205 to a Czech taxpayer in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="754">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the other goods had been picked up by the latter personally.</seg>
<seg id="757">By asking the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the relevant period before receiving a reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="758">Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="759">This test has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to the MIA's data, a German tax had paid in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech Taxpayer at a value of 46.854€.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-community acquisition of goods worth only €14,856.</seg>
<seg id="762">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="763">With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of € 31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="764">By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, the latter had contacted the Accountant of the Czech taxpayer and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about submitting a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">So far no supplementary VAT return has been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT determination for the relevant tax period were respected.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth € 11,600 to the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official asked to verify whether the Czech taxpayer mentioned actually existed, as the alleged owner of the German taxpayer had set up a number of shell companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech taxpayer, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech taxpayer submitted supporting documents for the sale in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech taxpayer was not registered as liable to VAT in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official forwarded these details to the German tax administration in his response to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="775">By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German taxpayer and at the same time asserted the right to deduct input tax for the acquisition from other member states.</seg>
<seg id="776">In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="777">On the basis of a supplementary VAT return submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">In this case, the Czech legislation did not provide for the purchase of goods from other member states, as the goods were not dispatched or transported from another member state to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">Thus, the Czech tax official has drawn a wrong conclusion during the external audit.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH noted that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded the payment of VAT worth € 1,600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the relevant FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-community deliveries that may not have been carried out:</seg>

<seg id="784">The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a car worth € 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The request for information was accompanied by a print of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="786">A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was also attached.</seg>
<seg id="787">In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official discovered that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had had no contact with a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, the print of which had been sent from the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="789">With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car.</seg>
<seg id="790">By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer is not domiciled at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is not available.</seg>
<seg id="791">After a tax appeal procedure for the Tax Period February 2005, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at zero.</seg>
<seg id="792">In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="793">The BRH found that the locally competent German tax officer had rejected the German taxpayer's claim for exemption of this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="794">19.in the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of € 3,000 between the value of the purchased goods as stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other member states.</seg>
<seg id="795">A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods worth € 89,424 to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of the deliveries and their payment as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered. </seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was allegedly a Relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech taxpayer submitted a VAT return and a tax return, which, after the deletion of the managing director in the Commercial Register, had been signed by an unauthorised person, namely this shareholder of the company.</seg>
<seg id="800">The Accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax official that the owner of the capital had deposited the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash receipts were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">By asking the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax officer had recognised the Czech taxpayer's right to VAT exemption for goods delivered to other member states in the value of CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer, since a German court had meanwhile confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a determined VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. according to MIAS data, in 2005, a German taxpayer acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth € 4,251,196, after which he had acquired goods worth € 43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-community acquisitions either in his 2004 VAT return or in the 2005 return.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, he did not declare any value-related initial sales.</seg>
<seg id="808">Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006. </seg>
<seg id="809">In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-community goods deliveries with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006 the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).</seg>
<seg id="812">From the documents provided to the NKÚ by the Responsible Tax officer, it can be seen that on 30 March 2006, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer, a protocol had been drawn up on the start of the VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005. </seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the tax officer asked the taxpayer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but he failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the commercial register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on May 16, 2005, without the appointment of a new managing director. </seg>
<seg id="815">The Czech taxpayer has not submitted any tax returns on sales since April 2006.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the parallel investigation, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two courts of auditors exchanged information about the cases examined via the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21.a Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent company (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct taxable business in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Based on this Information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and for the account of the Danish Customer.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to insufficient own production capacities, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German taxpayer (Ude) based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:</seg>
<seg id="824">- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.</seg>
<seg id="825">Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the Transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (Ude) is where the Transport began, i.e. in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC member state (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EC member state (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC member state for which the delivery was intended is different from the country of residence of the Czech Company19.</seg>
<seg id="828">Accordingly, this delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the input tax deduction in its VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the Transport started.</seg>
<seg id="830">However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">- The delivery of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community deliveries from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH noted that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-community deliveries uniformly as intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-community deliveries to Austria, but intra-community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">In order to ensure the taxation of intra-community acquisitions in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the NKÚ and BRH reviewed case designs to determine the magnitude of the differences between the information in the sales tax returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the taxpayers and the FA to apply the new legal regulations:</seg>
<seg id="840">22.in its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxpayer reported goods deliveries with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-community deliveries to another German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.</seg>
<seg id="842">From the information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ, it emerged that in both cases electricity deliveries were involved.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 different legal regulations on the supply or purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.</seg>
<seg id="845">Whereas in the Czech Republic, the taxable persons declared deliveries of electrical energy as intra - community deliveries of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, it was not an intra-community acquisition of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The differences in the legal provisions in the Czech Republic were eliminated by the adoption of Law No. 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005. </seg>
<seg id="847">23.in the examination of intra-community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxpayer declared intra-community deliveries to a German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 in its CM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and another Czech taxpayer declared intra-community deliveries to another German taxpayer with a value of CZK 263,470,776 in its CM for the same period.</seg>
<seg id="848">Information transmitted by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases it had been deliveries of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">In accordance with the wording of Law No. 235/2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment for which this supply takes place. </seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have reported the electricity deliveries in their ZM for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-community supplies led to a difference in the amount of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="852">Final remark</seg>
<seg id="853">Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NKÚ were achieved.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both audit offices gained in-depth knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them are worth further observation.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit results, both audit courts developed recommendations for the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control audit should be part of the further observation.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two accounting courts are the basis for the successful execution of future audits in the field of VAT administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement of construction services and Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and Overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance for the state as well as for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state has the task to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important element in the creation of a single Economic Area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to be able to guarantee largely unlimited competition across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements for their contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, the EU member states have to transfer and apply the EU procurement law into national law.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Below the EU thresholds, it is up to the individual countries to regulate the awarding of public contracts themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The award of services is also a corruption-prone area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Due to the fundamentally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue advantages in the award of their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to conduct parallel audits on the EU-wide award of construction services as well as on corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="14">The focus of the audits was on the application of the EU procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as preventing corruption in the award of construction services in building construction and road construction or transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">The awards below the EU thresholds were also included in the considerations in order to prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit results of both audit courts are summarised in this joint report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of supreme audit institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="18">Audit areas and audited bodies the evaluations of the Federal Court of auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross - sectional audits that it carried out in 2011/2012 with the building administrations responsible for the Federal Road and building construction in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large building projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the Federal Audit Office used results from previous investigations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on examination findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction measures in road construction, railway infrastructure construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction sectors in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the public contracts awarded by the federal government are mainly carried out by the building administrations of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the State Building administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In building construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budget funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, freelancers are also involved for parts of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="26">When comparing the evaluations, differences in the procurement law and in the market structure for construction services of both countries must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="27">Development of Public Procurement Law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to the national field are governed by budgetary law and the administrative regulations based on it.</seg>
<seg id="30">For both EU-wide and national procurement, many additional individual regulations are also specified by internal administrative provisions,</seg>
<seg id="31">such as the so-called" procurement manuals " of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or more precisely formulated in compliance with procurement law case law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and other statutory provisions which apply both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new regulation increased transparency in the handling of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited the possibilities of corruption in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Principles of Public Procurement Law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure are to be used in particular for EU-wide contracts.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, the National Award types (public tender, restricted tender, open tender) are to be used for Measures below the EU threshold, but these largely correspond to the EU-wide award types mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of priority of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public tender (for national contracts).</seg>
<seg id="39">In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested company can submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">Above all, the division of an overall construction project into specialist and partial lots serves this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="42">The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be used below the thresholds and under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Czech public procurement law, in accordance with EU law, contains provisions according to which contracts are to be concluded when competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow contracting authorities to choose between open and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the procurement types in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to 307 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of this amount, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15 %), which, in addition to federal construction, also includes the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The construction volume of the federal government in building construction and trunk road construction (excluding rail transport infrastructure and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the volume of contracts for construction work in building construction and highway construction in the Federal Republic of Germany was distributed among the types of contracts as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% restricted procedures and restricted tenders, and 6.6% negotiated procedures and open tenders.</seg>
<seg id="55">Of these, 33.2% were awarded Europe-wide.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, which represented about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, which represented 37% of the total construction volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for order volumes below the threshold 2.7% other procedures</seg>
<seg id="59">The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public procurement agencies in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries are directed towards a significant part of public procurement, the Prevention of corruption to be observed in all contracts has a great financial impact and the open procedure and the public tender are of outstanding importance in the award of contracts</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of results of parallel tests</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Nkú) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and on corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="63">In this context, the working groups of both audit bodies compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">In doing so, they essentially stated::</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (no. 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the EU regulations, the procurement regulations of both countries also serve to prevent corruption, which partly differ in their focus and in their detail (No. 3.2).</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, an essential requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information required for the proper preparation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The performance specifications must be neutral and must not have any restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Germany, the procurement documents have largely met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, it is still a Problem to determine the subject of the contract sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, construction work must be divided into lots, if possible, in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Nkú found in its tests, especially in the field of road construction, that the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Narrowing the market potential can result in significant cost increases and carry the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">In accordance with the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already commissioned additional or amended services that prove necessary after conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective specifications for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities are free to choose between open and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary primacy of the open procedure applies to EU-wide contracts or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts.</seg>
<seg id="79">This allows more companies to submit offers.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities awarded the construction services in principle throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, cost databases are used for the cost determination of public buildings, especially in building construction,</seg>
<seg id="84">based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective Instrument (No. 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">For construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to adapt to the planned Awards at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the audited building administrations complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or missing controls may affect competition (No. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of candidates for participation in public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">According to EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to the requirements of the EU, the awarding authorities in both countries should switch between the companies to be invited as often as possible when selecting applicants.</seg>
<seg id="93">In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="94">The audited administrations disregarded these requirements in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, in the interest of equal competition, it is necessary to ensure that the companies interested in submitting a bid receive the same information during the bidding phase.</seg>
<seg id="97">In order to avoid anticompetitive agreements, contact between these companies and with freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description must be avoided as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="98">The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">The certified building authorities in Germany partially did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">When opening the offers in both countries, the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency must be observed in particular.</seg>
<seg id="101">The specifications for the marking, documentation, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tests in both countries revealed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by requirements for the structure and process Organization.</seg>
<seg id="104">The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, procurement agencies handed over offers for examination to third parties without having to look through the offers beforehand and sufficiently document abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="106">The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition should be informed of the intended assignment before the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="109">The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities not comply with the specified deadlines for the award of contracts or deviated from the bidders ' offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible with the audited building administrations in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">The EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notes of some procedures.</seg>
<seg id="113">Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the anti-corruption function of the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">The contracting authorities of both countries largely fulfilled their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Fundamentals of EU procurement law and Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the procurement coordination directive and the remedies directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the member states.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general procurement principles of the European Union are in particular the competition law, the Equal Treatment Law or the Prohibition of discrimination as well as the transparency law.</seg>
<seg id="119">In order to achieve these objectives, the procurement coordination directive contains special provisions for construction services to be awarded throughout the EU for construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="120">For this purpose, their estimated order amounts must reach or exceed a current volume of 5,000,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="121">The regulations concern, in particular, documents the content of the Award, the publication of certain information before, during, and after the award, to Comply with deadlines, including for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the procurement procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of the applicants and The remedies Directive provides the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of possible infringements of Public Procurement Law, the companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">Importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">In both countries there is no legal Definition of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private benefit,</seg>
<seg id="128">which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can impede competition and cause significant economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the European Union, the scale of these costs is estimated at 1%.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of public clients, restrictive agreements or unfair conduct may call into question trust in the integrity and functioning of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">They have to check the structure and process Organization of their administrations for areas particularly at risk of corruption in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption there.</seg>
<seg id="135">Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of Public Works is generally regarded as a particularly corrupt field of work.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption – in particular bribery and bribery as well as acceptance and approval of benefits-is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="139">In order to prevent corruption, the federal government has adopted a directive and recommendations on the Prevention of Corruption12 in the federal administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed for the procurement area: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and billing, precise and complete documentation of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the procurement regulations.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, for example, the Federal Ministry responsible for procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,</seg>
<seg id="142">with the award data − such as the estimated costs and the order totals-as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected comprehensively and evaluated for abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="143">Corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders as well as the Prohibition of any discrimination form the most important foundations of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on combating corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national procurement law and corresponding administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation contains essentially the following provisions: reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation to publish the contracts in advance by the awarding authority, including the reasons for the tender, Prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus abolition of the possibility of selecting tenderers by lot, introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Examination results for the individual phases of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Procurement documents the procurement documents must contain all the information that the bidders need for the proper preparation of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the procurement documents must enable a correct calculation.</seg>
<seg id="152">No risks may be transferred to bidders that are not calculable for them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The procurement documents consist in particular of the service description and the contract conditions.</seg>
<seg id="154">In addition, they contain the specifications for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.</seg>
<seg id="155">Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="156">The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are directed in particular to the technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="157">These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="158">The service description must be product-neutral.</seg>
<seg id="159">Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.</seg>
<seg id="160">The avoidance of restrictions on competition in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the procurement documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation when preparing the tenders and for manipulation of their valuation.</seg>
<seg id="162">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="163">Same or similar regulations in both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications have been transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="164">The services are generally product-neutral without specification.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the service descriptions, the individual services must usually be subdivided in detail into service units with respective quantities.</seg>
<seg id="166">The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m2 or per piece).</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases may performance be defined by functional targets.</seg>
<seg id="168">In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.</seg>
<seg id="170">Compensation according to flat rates or according to time expenditure must be avoided as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified specifications in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The service descriptions must enable the bidders to create their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The tender shall only be made public when the tender documents have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="175">There is no obligation to tender for construction works in lots in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="176">If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public procurement authorities may subdivide construction services into several lots.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, construction services are generally to be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and/ or by type or subject area (specialist lots).</seg>
<seg id="178">This should enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price agreements more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is usually considered the most economical.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be indicated in the procurement documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should allow applicants to be fully and conclusively aware of the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the specification of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria are to be recorded only in an internal administrative procurement note.</seg>
<seg id="184">Procurement documents drawn up by authorised freelancers may not contain references to these offices or involved planners or experts in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is intended to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client through contact with these freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why freelance procurement documents may neither send nor interpret planning documents for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contact person of the companies is solely the client.</seg>
<seg id="188">There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additional or amended services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) are almost always required for large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="190">In both countries, the statutory provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of supplements to the company already commissioned, without the need for a public procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of the supplementary services may not exceed half of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies for a corresponding award without public notice.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.</seg>
<seg id="195">If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible under the regulations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="196">In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis of the price determination of the order already issued must be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to supplementary benefits, there may also be a reduction in the scope of benefits.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset against additional additional services.</seg>
<seg id="199">Essential Examination Results</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">Some performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications – for example for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels-without this being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product was eligible.</seg>
<seg id="205">Tables of services broken down according to partial services</seg>
<seg id="206">The BRH has not found in any of the audited procedures violations of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="208">In the vast majority of the procedures, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="209">In some procedures, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.</seg>
<seg id="210">In some cases, the service lists contained items that did not determine whether they were needed.</seg>
<seg id="211">A list of services for demolition work even consisted almost half of such demand items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Lots and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">With many awards, the prescribed reason was missing, why the predominantly after unprofessional advertised services were not further divided into partial lots.</seg>
<seg id="214">There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="215">References to freelancers</seg>
<seg id="216">A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the involved freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="217">Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or reports.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the awarding authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender".</seg>
<seg id="219">In the building sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints mentioned predominantly to the failures of the freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="220">The Construction Services pointed out the lack of capacities in order to be able to adequately control the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="221">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral tender in the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.</seg>
<seg id="223">The awarding authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.</seg>
<seg id="224">During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="225">Performance descriptions with performance units</seg>
<seg id="226">In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the awarding authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="227">As performance units, it only specified the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="229">During the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance specifications were changed four times in the period from August to September 2009 as part of a restricted procedure,</seg>
<seg id="230">since the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.</seg>
<seg id="231">Tender documents for Social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary structural studies and incomplete design drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="232">During the construction of a large library building, the interior specification contained no requirements for product quality.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result of these missing specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lots and selection criteria</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="236">An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring revealed that savings of up to 31.6 million euros at a total cost of 620.3 million euros would have been possible if selected parts were awarded in batches.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, six different buildings that were the subject of a single contract could have saved 2.5 million euros (25 %) if the contract had been awarded in batches.</seg>
<seg id="238">With a loose allocation of 20 bridges, savings of 11.5 million euros (25 %) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.</seg>
<seg id="239">When awarding construction services in road construction, the central awarding authority specified very extensive reference requirements as selection criteria.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the case of the construction of a part of a motorway, the awarding authority required the tenderers to provide evidence of at least three road construction projects, each worth 28 million euros, carried out over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public award of another section of a motorway comprised six separate construction projects, in which the awarding authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million in the last three years as the selection criterion for the companies.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of the funds spent on road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were allocated to contracts from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.</seg>
<seg id="244">In 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even only one bidder submitted an offer.</seg>
<seg id="245">The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Additional Services</seg>
<seg id="247">In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the awarding authority did not apply any of the legally prescribed procedures when awarding additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.</seg>
<seg id="248">Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, additions were made in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case of up to EUR 165.4 million (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="249">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="250">For several university buildings, some services were not listed in the procurement documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="251">Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiated procedures with the contracted companies without a contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="252">During the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiated procedures without a tender.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction period, the awarding authority expanded the scope of the works by 2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.</seg>
<seg id="255">Further Findings</seg>
<seg id="256">Based on a sample survey of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to EUR 14.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">In Germany, however, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of construction.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison indicates that highway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary Findings</seg>
<seg id="260">In both countries, the basic rules on procurement documents are largely identical and take into account the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="261">They serve both a comprehensive and fair competition as well as the Prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">For example, the requirement for the sufficient certainty of the service descriptions should enable the bidders to calculate and prepare their offers appropriately,</seg>
<seg id="263">protect the client from additional services to be agreed subsequently and also limit speculation.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the common basic specifications for the procurement documents are supplemented by regulations that are intended to further reduce restrictions on competition and opportunities for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="265">There are no requirements to this extent in the Czech Republic, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="266">The requirements for the description of services have been largely complied with in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions of competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The existing requirement to form lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.</seg>
<seg id="269">In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can result in restrictions of the provider field on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="270">The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow range of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="271">Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">The regulatory approaches in both countries differ with regard to the award and remuneration of additional or amended services.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to the EU regulations as well as the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a procurement procedure with public announcement.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in a negotiated procedure without notice.</seg>
<seg id="275">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="277">since the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the excess is greater than 20 %, the additional services must be tendered with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing services into lots, restrictions of competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Defining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="281">By defining the type of award, the client determines the amount of the number of companies participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">It may leave the range of possible candidates and tenderers largely Unlimited, for example by choosing an open procedure or by limiting the scope of non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="283">For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures shall be applied.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">When choosing the type of contract, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European law requirements on competition and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is equal to or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services are generally to be awarded throughout Europe according to open or restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="288">In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and may award construction services in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="289">A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to withdraw it from the obligation to award the construction services throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="290">Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="291">The detailed justification of the chosen type of contract as well as the examination of the obligation to apply EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the contract award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements on procurement procedures and the threshold value into national law.</seg>
<seg id="295">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="297">There is freedom of choice between the open and the restricted procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. Other procedures, however, are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or – in the case of national contracts − the public tender generally take precedence. This is determined by the budget and procurement law as well as by the guidelines for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of procurement – such as the open procedure or the Restricted Tender − are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of priority of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure the most unrestricted competition possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by defining certain tenderers and to make possible price agreements between tenderers more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="302">The principle of public tendering is a central Element in preventing corruption in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.</seg>
<seg id="304">The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organizations to determine the expected costs in the field of Public Building Construction.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost parameters for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such cost parameters, the estimated contract value of a planned project or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only some construction administrations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price estimates of comparable construction measures when determining the expected costs of construction services.</seg>
<seg id="310">In most cases, the cost estimates are based on estimates made by the financing agency or result from the amount of funds made available to the Building Services Agency.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures to standardize cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.</seg>
<seg id="312">As part of the Anti - Corruption Plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.</seg>
<seg id="313">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="314">In this database, information on material expenditure and construction and finishing works as well as other cost - relevant data are to be recorded in order to enable cost estimates and provisions of unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control,</seg>
<seg id="316">which is intended to serve as a benchmark for pricing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="317">Essential test results BRH</seg>
<seg id="318">Choice of award procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities largely wrote out the construction works in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus followed the budgetary and procurement requirements.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the construction work of the federal government in building construction was put out to public tender or in an open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">In the selection of non-public types of procurement, detailed reasons were sometimes lacking as to why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.</seg>
<seg id="323">In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures that non - public procurement methods have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted in public tenders as in restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as in private tenders.</seg>
<seg id="325">The study also showed that the offer prices were on average 6% and 10% higher for restricted tenders and hand-over tenders than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of construction and a State Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement methods.</seg>
<seg id="327">As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of construction even found twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="329">For the construction projects for which they had calculated an estimated total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually drew up procurement plans in which they defined the construction services to be awarded in accordance with EU-wide as well as national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, a share of more than 80% of the construction work was to be awarded throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">Circumventing the obligation to award contracts across the EU through too low cost estimates was not detectable.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures fell below the de facto level.</seg>
<seg id="333">During construction, some contracting authorities inadmissibly changed the specifications of their procurement plans.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures was still adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="335">For most of the construction measures examined, the proportion of EU-wide contracts awarded according to the settlement results was usually lower than foreseen under the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities violated the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more of the single lots in EU-wide procedures,</seg>
<seg id="337">and instead chose national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="338">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of award type</seg>
<seg id="340">For several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several partial contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.</seg>
<seg id="341">As a result of these divisions, the individual services were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="342">Calculation methods for the estimated order value</seg>
<seg id="343">In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an insufficient Instrument to determine the expected order values.</seg>
<seg id="344">The data were based on construction projects that had just been completed, but where there were indications of a lack of economic efficiency, unnecessary additional performance expenditure or excessive profits of the commissioned companies.</seg>
<seg id="345">For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined using the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">In the meantime, the Ministry of transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="347">In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by the investors.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimated values.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, however, eight additions in the course of construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros or 27 %.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, the actual value of the contract for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, although here too costs increased during the construction phase.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the offer prices exceeded the estimated values and increased during construction.</seg>
<seg id="352">When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, costs rose disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had only increased by 12%.</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary Findings</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented the EU rules for determining the type of award and for taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations largely correspond.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to the non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in the competition in public procedures or public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="357">The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of Offers and the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="358">The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the candidate field by regulations of the client that are susceptible to manipulation and by making price agreements between the bidders more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="359">The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="360">According to Czech legislation, contracting authorities may award contracts in open or restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="361">According to the latest changes in procurement law, the number of tenderers may no longer be limited in Proceedings Involving previous competition.</seg>
<seg id="362">Thus, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the awarding authorities have largely followed the guidelines on the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services were improperly allocated in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.</seg>
<seg id="364">When taking into account the EU threshold value, errors had to be detected in Germany that resulted in a fall below the minimum proportion of services advertised throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected costs of construction services and construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">If necessary, the building authorities should ensure by means of further checks that the specifications for the choice of the type of contract as well as the scope of services to be written out throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for appropriate cost assessments are created.</seg>
<seg id="367">Prior information and announcement</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies about the planned Awards in advance of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for a Europe-wide competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">The preliminary information shall contain the essential information under public procurement law relating to the planned construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">They are required for those construction projects for which the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and for which the client wishes to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">In notices, the client must provide further details on the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe in a binding manner.</seg>
<seg id="374">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="375">In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.</seg>
<seg id="376">The common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV Codes), which is standardized throughout Europe, must be used to describe the object of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and notices are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer profile of the client.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to prevent any discrimination against foreign interested parties, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the text of the announcement has been sent to the office for official publications of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="380">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for prior information and publication into national law.</seg>
<seg id="383">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published for construction works not to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="385">Procurement procedures may be started no earlier than one month after the sending of the preliminary information to the EU official journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the National Official Journal (for all contracts).</seg>
<seg id="386">Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a preliminary information be dispensed with.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, no prior information is required for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="388">In national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and participation competitions must be published before restricted tenders on the federal government's internet portal and, if applicable, in newspapers or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted tenders without a competition, notices of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">All planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.</seg>
<seg id="391">In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the loose construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="392">In the Czech Republic, this regulation has only a small impact, as much less construction work is divided into lots.</seg>
<seg id="393">Essential Examination Results</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Pre-information</seg>
<seg id="396">The examined contracting authorities published preliminary information for all tested construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open proceedings, however, they shortened offer periods, although the 52-day period necessary between the sending of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">Other shortened procedures were only tendered after the twelve-month period of validity of the prior information had already expired and before it had been extended.</seg>
<seg id="399">Many published preliminary information lacked references to the planned division of construction services into lots.</seg>
<seg id="400">Notice</seg>
<seg id="401">The notices of the audited entities partly contained CPV Codes that deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or that did not accurately record the required services.</seg>
<seg id="402">In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information – e.g. on the deadlines for implementation – than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="405">It published the reports on its own fee-based procurement platform.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the awarding authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the reports to the free internet portal of the federal government as required.</seg>
<seg id="407">Samples showed that only one third of the reports of the audited administration were published on this Portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="409">Notice</seg>
<seg id="410">When building a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on the basis of which it wanted to select the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="411">The awarding authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.</seg>
<seg id="412">The limitation of the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the awarding authority did not specify in any detail in the contract notice or in the documentation of the contract award procedure, according to which it would assess the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="414">In its assessment, the awarding authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst ratings from the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="415">The procedure of the awarding authority was not transparent because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of notices</seg>
<seg id="417">During the renovation of former military sites, the awarding authority did not publish the tender.</seg>
<seg id="418">Summary Findings</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage Information System with prior information and publicity is an important component in order to implement the transparency requirement for Europe-wide procurement, to strengthen competition and thus also to prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures also in the national procurement area:</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates for non-public procurement</seg>
<seg id="422">In contrast to public procurement procedures, in non-public procurement procedures, not every company that is interested in performing the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="423">In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the awarding authority must make a selection in advance of which companies are to be invited to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption the EU regulations allow a limit on the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, in the case of restricted procedures, at least five companies are to be invited to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="426">At least three companies must be invited to participate in negotiated procedures with a contract award notice.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of companies to be invited is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be unilaterally preferred.</seg>
<seg id="430">In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both cases, the award result may be significantly affected at the expense of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="432">The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="435">The rules for selecting applicants are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding authorities should switch among the companies to be invited as often as possible when selecting candidates.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor may Competition be limited to companies located in certain regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The awarding authorities shall justify the selection of applicants and document the course of the selection procedure in their award notes.</seg>
<seg id="439">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three suitable candidates are to be invited to submit tenders in the case of restricted tenders and, in principle, several suitable candidates in the case of free-handed tenders.</seg>
<seg id="441">Under the new Czech regulations, it is inadmissible − apart from two special areas − to limit the number of bidders in restricted and negotiated procedures.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.</seg>
<seg id="443">If, for example, an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non - public procurement procedure, the management level of the building services department or an agent from the procurement agency must generally amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and/ or supplementing a new company.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is intended to prevent a single Person from being able to determine the final circle of companies to be involved in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could enable far-reaching agreements between the parties involved.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of companies to be invited is to be treated confidentially – also towards freelancers – and not to be made generally accessible.</seg>
<seg id="447">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.</seg>
<seg id="449">According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be called upon, but can only submit proposals to the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.</seg>
<seg id="451">Essential Examination Results</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of applicants</seg>
<seg id="454">With a few exceptions, the requirement to request a minimum number of companies to submit tenders in the case of non-public contracts was met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in building construction revealed that the awarding authorities invited an average of 6.6 companies to submit tenders for restricted tenders from the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for open - ended tenders.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of companies and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">Especially for trades with few suppliers, the awarding authorities did not always change the circle of selected applicants.</seg>
<seg id="458">Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and proven in their view.</seg>
<seg id="459">As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete must be ensured before the invitation to submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="460">The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regional companies than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting authorities attributed this above all to the fact that the scope of services in the non-public procurement procedures is on average much smaller and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Multi-eyes principle and suggestions of freelancers</seg>
<seg id="463">Contrary to the regulations, the contracting authorities mostly failed to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.</seg>
<seg id="464">They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacities, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.</seg>
<seg id="465">It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to submit a bid.</seg>
<seg id="466">Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the candidate lists and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the awarding authorities.</seg>
<seg id="467">Thus, the awarding authorities did not protect themselves to the extent required from possible manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidential treatment of bidder lists</seg>
<seg id="469">At a procurement office, the lists of the companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this office.</seg>
<seg id="470">In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or approved companies could have been passed on without authorisation and, for example, could have enabled agreements between these companies.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="473">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection of applicants</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders received no information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="476">In the restricted procedures for the expansion and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="477">In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, thus exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="478">The procurement committee then carried out a lottery process to select the companies.</seg>
<seg id="479">However, this procedure, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary Findings</seg>
<seg id="481">Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the awarding authorities to propose the companies to be invited, the German regulations restrict such possibilities of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of the Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can in particular counteract possible manipulative restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been insufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation of an abusive restriction of the number of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the identified deficits.</seg>
<seg id="486">Offer phase</seg>
<seg id="487">With the announcement of the award or with the invitation to submit a bid, the tender phase begins, in which the companies can create offers on the basis of the procurement documents sent to them.</seg>
<seg id="488">Applicants may submit their offers until the deadline set by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of EU law and Corruption Prevention</seg>
<seg id="490">There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authorities must observe the national regulations with which the possibilities of manipulation existing during the tender phase are to be counteracted.</seg>
<seg id="492">These are mainly organizational specifications and controls.</seg>
<seg id="493">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="495">The procurement documents on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their tenders are only to be sent by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Freelancers involved in the procurement procedure may not perform this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The awarding authority shall ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the bidding phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of ambiguities in the procurement documents or other questions relating to the tender, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="499">Freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the procurement documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="501">The freelancers must not become a hub of the procurement procedure, through which contacts with anticompetitive consequences can be established.</seg>
<seg id="502">Offers sent by Post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Electronically transmitted offers have a technical encryption.</seg>
<seg id="504">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the awarding authority may also Commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="506">The received offers shall be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and forwarded directly, immediately and unopened to a staff member responsible for safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This staff member may not be involved in the award.</seg>
<seg id="508">The received offers must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the received offers are marked with a reference number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The awarding authority records the offer data including order numbers as well as the creation and receipt data in a log.</seg>
<seg id="511">The safekeeping of offers is not regulated in detail in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="512">Essential Examination Results</seg>
<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">The tests for the tender phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building administration.</seg>
<seg id="515">Dispatch of procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The contracting authorities of the certified building administration sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.</seg>
<seg id="517">Freelancers did not send any procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to applicants</seg>
<seg id="519">The tested building management mostly did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and allocation when naming the contact persons for queries and information.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the procurement office, but from the project managers as contact persons.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some procurement documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had created the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="522">In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information when asking questions during the bidding phase.</seg>
<seg id="523">Marking of tenders</seg>
<seg id="524">All received offers were stamped and marked with the entry stamp of the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="525">In some hands - free Awards, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the pretensions to prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Safekeeping of offers</seg>
<seg id="527">After their identification, not all offers came directly and immediately to the employee responsible for the custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">In a construction department, the offers were meanwhile stored in an open compartment of the post office to which every employee had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another department had hung up a mailbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which the offers submitted there sometimes even stayed overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">Since the insertion slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff members, but also visitors to the department would have had the opportunity to remove offers received and, if necessary, to manipulate them.</seg>
<seg id="531">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="532">No defects were reported on the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary Findings</seg>
<seg id="534">During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement procedure are to be prevented in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="535">By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment shall also be respected.</seg>
<seg id="536">The regulations for the receipt, safekeeping and secrecy of the offers appear suitable in order to be able to counteract Manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.</seg>
<seg id="543">From the opening date, the bidders are bound to their offers until the deadline set by the awarding authority expires.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">No separate EU legal regulations are specified for the opening of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="546">For this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure, however, the national regulations on corruption prevention contain extensive provisions for the protection of offers and competition.</seg>
<seg id="547">The multi-eyes principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the Offer Opening are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.</seg>
<seg id="548">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from uncontrollably manipulating the offers when opening the offers.</seg>
<seg id="552">In most procurement procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="553">Only offers which were available to the negotiator at the opening of the first offer are permitted.</seg>
<seg id="554">Offers received late May in principle no longer be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a minutes, in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices must be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="556">The minutes shall be read out and signed by the negotiator.</seg>
<seg id="557">It can also be signed by the bidders present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a committee conducts the opening of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="560">Freelancers can also participate.</seg>
<seg id="561">The committee may also be entrusted with further phases of the procurement procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary conduct the opening of the offer.</seg>
<seg id="563">The negotiator must be a staff member of the tendering body.</seg>
<seg id="564">The negotiator and, in the case of contracts in building construction, also the Secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the contract documents as well as in the award and contract execution.</seg>
<seg id="565">According to German regulations, the minutes of the opening date must include information on discounts and discounts as well as special features − such as damaged or delayed offers − in addition to the offer prices.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's right to sign it are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="567">The German regulations provide that the open offers are to be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.</seg>
<seg id="568">The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made accessible to persons directly responsible for processing them.</seg>
<seg id="569">Appropriate Czech regulations do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="570">If only one offer is received in a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.</seg>
<seg id="571">There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received, this is to be opened and then evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Essential Examination Results</seg>
<seg id="573">BRH</seg>
<seg id="574">Multi-Eye Principle</seg>
<seg id="575">The audited awarding authorities implemented the specifications for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.</seg>
<seg id="576">They each carried out the opening dates with negotiators and clerks who were not tasked with any other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in the case of hands-free contracts with a lower scope of services, there were isolated cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Protocol</seg>
<seg id="579">In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, for example, the late submitted offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Marking of tenders</seg>
<seg id="582">In accordance with the specifications, the awarding authorities examined in the framework of the cross-sectional examination marked the tenders with the date of the opening date through a perforation.</seg>
<seg id="583">In the case of tests carried out by some recipients of grants, insufficient markings had been found.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, these contracting authorities changed their marking practice after the complaint by the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="585">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="586">Offer period</seg>
<seg id="587">In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was only received by the awarding authority one month after the expiry of the offer period. Nevertheless, the awarding authority accepted this offer.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary Findings</seg>
<seg id="589">The regulations of both countries for the opening of the offers agree in relevant parts. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation can be significantly limited when the offers are opened.</seg>
<seg id="590">The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, the safe storage and the secrecy of the offers significantly restrict manipulation possibilities such as subsequent changes to the offers.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, the persons responsible for opening the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The overall only few complaints prove the high acceptance of the specifications for the opening of the offer.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of offers</seg>
<seg id="595">Examination and evaluation of the offers the client shall examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="596">He shall determine the offer for the award of the contract that best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">The requirements of the EU provide for a multi-stage procedure:</seg>
<seg id="599">The suitability of the bidders must first be determined.</seg>
<seg id="600">Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="601">Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud offences, for example, are to be excluded from participation in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="602">The offers of the non-excluded bidders must be checked mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The client shall determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices must be examined by the client in particular.</seg>
<seg id="604">The examination and evaluation of the offers is a particularly vulnerable phase of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, bidders may be unfairly excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">Due to the preference or disadvantage of bidders, the result of the evaluation can be impermissibly impaired and thus the determination of the economically most advantageous offer can be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="607">The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the examination and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.</seg>
<seg id="608">It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.</seg>
<seg id="609">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="611">In accordance with the requirements of the EU, the offers in both countries are to be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements for the suitability certificates to be submitted by the companies as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are specified in the notices or in the procurement documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">After checking the suitability of the bidder, the selection criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="614">The evaluation must be limited to the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The submitted offers must first be formally checked as to whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.</seg>
<seg id="616">If bidders are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the evaluation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.</seg>
<seg id="618">The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented comprehensibly.</seg>
<seg id="619">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly commissioned with the processing.</seg>
<seg id="621">The review of the offers as well as the calculation of the offers may only be carried out by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="622">It shall only employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.</seg>
<seg id="623">The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.</seg>
<seg id="624">If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the awarding authorities.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic procurement committees are to be set up for the examination and evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.</seg>
<seg id="628">Ultimately, as in Germany, only the awarding authorities have to decide on the contract awards.</seg>
<seg id="629">If proofs or declarations required for the submission of tenders in Germany are submitted only incompletely, the awarding authority shall give the tenderers the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether it gives the tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.</seg>
<seg id="634">If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of too low or too high prices for partial services, the bidder must be asked to clear up these ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id="635">If he fails to do so and the awarding authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer shall be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is intended to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their bid, which can result in significant cost increases for the construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price is evaluated, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.</seg>
<seg id="638">A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">A contract may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more offers fall below the correct price determination of the customer or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their offers.</seg>
<seg id="641">If this is not possible for you, the awarding authority may exclude the relevant offers.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after the economic efficiency test if only offers with unjustifiable low prices are available.</seg>
<seg id="643">In contrast to the German procurement law, the contract can not be refused for offers with prices substantially above the calculation of the customer for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="644">If in Germany there is a suspicion of anticompetitive behaviour, the awarding authority must report immediately to the leading level of technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="645">The latter has to decide which measures are to be taken and whether the Antitrust Authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.</seg>
<seg id="646">The technical supervision leading level must also agree, for example, for works over 50,000 euros, if a contract is to be awarded by hand, a contract is not to be awarded on the tender with the lowest price or the tender is to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">There are no corresponding regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">Essential Examination Results</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Suitability and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">The majority of the procurement procedures audited complied with the listed specifications.</seg>
<seg id="652">For some of the companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">A beneficiary commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being fully available.</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, it was not clear whether the awarding authority had taken all the announced award criteria into account in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the criterion "price".</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some awarding bodies used non-approved persons for this purpose when examining the offers.</seg>
<seg id="657">Thus, freelancers or employees involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that were only to be carried out by employees of the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacities in the respective areas.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfil their contractual obligations also participated in the freelance work commissioned to examine the offers.</seg>
<seg id="660">For the construction services, it was usually also not comprehensible whether the offers of the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and calculation of offers</seg>
<seg id="662">Some awarding bodies handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the mathematical examination itself and documented their results.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the awarding authorities.</seg>
<seg id="664">In the examined documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partially not or only insufficiently marked.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">In a sample in a building administration, the cheapest offers in three quarters of the procurement procedures examined differed more than 10% from the previously determined estimate costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">Every twentieth award procedure was cancelled due to inappropriate offer prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">Not all tender reviews and clarification discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, more detailed explanations were missing, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.</seg>
<seg id="670">Often the deviations were only justified on a flat-rate basis, e.g. by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction services explained that it was difficult to detect and prove mixed calculations.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of an invitation to tender issued by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% lower than the previously determined estimated value of these services.</seg>
<seg id="673">Further calculation tests or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="674">In a reconnaissance meeting, the awarding authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then commissioned company.</seg>
<seg id="675">This left it unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the client rated the commissioned company as a" low-cost company", which could neither maintain quality nor deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another tender, a construction service agency awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.</seg>
<seg id="678">She did not cancel the tender and cited the non-pertinent reason that this company could be concluded on an adequate calculation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">In an audited construction administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the technical supervision leading level.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the awarding authority excluded both bids from the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the application of the remaining regulations, the tests did not result in any significant complaints.</seg>
<seg id="683">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="684">Aptitude test</seg>
<seg id="685">For many of the construction projects examined, including university construction, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Rating</seg>
<seg id="687">When awarding works for a water treatment plant, the awarding authority disregarded the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="688">In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the Evaluation Criteria Only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of road maintenance measures, the specified criterion "shortening of the construction phase" was wrongly evaluated in a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the offered reduction was insufficiently taken into account by the bidders in second and third positions.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the selection of offers</seg>
<seg id="692">In three procurement procedures within the framework of the housing promotion, the awarding authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on which basis it had selected the successful bidder.</seg>
<seg id="693">In the case of the construction of a motorway, the awarding authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery terms.</seg>
<seg id="694">Tests of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary Findings</seg>
<seg id="696">The regulations for the examination and evaluation of the offers comply with the requirements of the EU in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, the respective regulations differ with regard to details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, the procedure is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered is to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, some of the procurement procedures examined had to be found to be insufficient or not sufficiently documented for essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="701">However, possible manipulative interventions are favoured without comprehensibility and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently looked through and documented the offers beforehand and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="703">If contracting authorities have tasks carried out by third parties during the examination and evaluation of the offers, sufficient precautions and an increased inspection effort are required in order to counter the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">When assessing the appropriateness of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, complaints arose above all in the aptitude test and in the application of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Conclusion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After the examination and evaluation of the offers, the award procedure is concluded by granting the award or by cancelling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the envisaged award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">The companies have the possibility to examine the intended award by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or, in the case of other means of communication, within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="711">A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.</seg>
<seg id="712">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="713">If a bidder submits a request for review within the Information period, the conclusion of a contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">The companies may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.</seg>
<seg id="715">The review procedure shall ensure the legal protection of the companies and shall require the client to observe the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="716">To do this, he must document the procedure sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="717">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented the EU rules on information and review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it may not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="722">The client shall place the order within the stated deadline,</seg>
<seg id="723">also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the expiry of the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="724">In the case of open and restricted procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="725">The unsuccessful tenderers shall be informed promptly of the decision to award the contract and of the reasons for not taking into account their offers.</seg>
<seg id="726">Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g. if the offer prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="727">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the 10 - or 15-day information and waiting obligation before the contract is awarded also applies to construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.</seg>
<seg id="730">In other proceedings in Germany, tenderers can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure must be terminated if only one offer has been received or only one offer has been evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable tender, provided that it complies with the terms of the tender and is economically viable.</seg>
<seg id="733">Essential Examination Results</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">There were only a few complaints about the audited contracts at the end of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, companies received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information periods, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In individual cases, Order letters also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, the clients did not comply with the award deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="739">In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to perform the services at the originally offered price after the expiry of the contract period.</seg>
<seg id="740">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some contracts, for example for the construction of road maintenance, for the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after expiry of the statutory period.</seg>
<seg id="743">In the case of the award of works for the renovation of former military sites, the awarding authority forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders only after expiry of the statutory period.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary Findings</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the EU guidelines at the conclusion of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of the unsuccessful candidates or tenderers increases the instruments of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The scope of legal protection in Czech procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, the deadlines for placing orders were exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In the future, the building authorities should avoid the identified defects when concluding their procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The award procedures must be comprehensibly documented during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the justifications of the individual decisions.</seg>
<seg id="753">For EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.</seg>
<seg id="754">The order data are also recorded in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption by documenting the procurement procedures, a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement is implemented.</seg>
<seg id="756">A carefully and promptly prepared documentation only enables the traceability of the procurement decisions.</seg>
<seg id="757">In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders in the case of contracts above the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential component to avoid corruption, since the compulsion to justify procurement decisions in detail significantly restricts scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">The contract notice for an EU-wide procurement procedure has to be sent by the respective contracting authority to the office for official publications of the EU within 48 days.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the EU Commission draws up an annual EU statistics, through which it can obtain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.</seg>
<seg id="763">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting obligations into national law.</seg>
<seg id="766">The rules for documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The publication period is shortened to 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for restricted tenders and for free-handed awards above value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called Ex-post Transparency).</seg>
<seg id="771">Below these value limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information about the orders placed.</seg>

<seg id="775">A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The procurement notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.</seg>
<seg id="777">In a procurement procedure, the awarding authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.</seg>
<seg id="778">In a few cases, the documents of the awarding authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="779">Notices of orders</seg>
<seg id="780">In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to make the awarding of contracts public.</seg>
<seg id="781">In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had made the awarded contracts public.</seg>
<seg id="782">Reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="783">The statistical tables consulted contained the required minimum information. They were drawn up and sent on schedule.</seg>
<seg id="784">Ex-post Transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the audited building authorities published the order data of the completed procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="786">However, due to a transmission error, this data was not published in a construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="787">The construction management noticed this error only after half a year,</seg>
<seg id="788">so that the order data of the procurement procedures completed up to that time were not published.</seg>
<seg id="789">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">In the case of construction work for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings. These were mainly incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the valuation commissions.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some minutes of the openings were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Notices of orders</seg>
<seg id="794">In the case of several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were only published late or not at all.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary Findings</seg>
<seg id="796">The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are largely identical in both countries and implement the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="797">The transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, is thereby guaranteed in principle.</seg>
<seg id="798">The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go somewhat further than the requirements in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="799">The deficiencies identified in the documentation and in the notices partially substantially limited the orruption - preventing effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="800">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="801">The building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and orders and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel tests carried out by the NKÚ and BRH focused on two main areas that are essential for the award of construction services by public authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU procurement rules and the Prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Anti-corruption measures do not only serve to prevent or at least reduce corruption. You should also avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these rules, provide information on similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement rules</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed the EU requirements for the award of construction services into national law.</seg>
<seg id="809">This means that in the Czech Republic and Germany there is an important common basis for the award of construction services and the consideration of the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the participating companies and transparency of the award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">The building administrations of both countries have partially supported these bids very extensively by further administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has to a large extent also transferred the specifications for the construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the court of auditors ' investigations have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="813">The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints identified when implementing the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">The tests in the Czech Republic have shown above all risks that affect the economic viability of the contracts.</seg>
<seg id="815">Thus, incomplete service descriptions made additional services necessary, which were often awarded in violation of legal regulations. In addition, the cost assessments were usually insufficiently prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the transport sector.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">The investigations have not had the goal of uncovering corruption cases,</seg>
<seg id="818">also because the courts of auditors do not have the appropriate instruments for this.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the courts of auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and Manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">Both countries have set different priorities in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="821">Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech regulations aim above all at increased transparency of procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of prevention of corruption apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their special requirements.</seg>
<seg id="826">In some cases, the corresponding Regulations specify very precisely how the bids for corruption prevention are to be taken into account when the procurement procedures are completed and when the persons involved are selected.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the view of the BRH, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is a suitable Instrument in order to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the award of construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interventions.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analyses and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organizational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and Manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore sees no fundamental need to change the corresponding specifications of the administrations when awarding construction services.</seg>
<seg id="830">The regulations for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some specifications.</seg>
<seg id="832">The building authorities should further train their employees on the requirements for corruption prevention and raise them even more awareness of this problem.</seg>
<seg id="833">A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.</seg>
<seg id="835">Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="837">At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption, in which public procurement is the most important component.</seg>
<seg id="838">The Procurement Act and its implementing rules have been substantially amended.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audits of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the cost-effectiveness of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the type of evaluations, and properly document and publish all these aspects.</seg>
<seg id="841">Make recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">The NKÚ and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU requirements in principle positively.</seg>
<seg id="843">The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous material and immaterial damage potential caused by Manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the building authorities in their countries as being called upon to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and Manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the Organisation and procedures of the procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.</seg>
<seg id="847">The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="848">A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a favourable effect on the offer prices, provided that this leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient procurement activities of contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks – with the exception of transport construction projects – are performed by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.</seg>
<seg id="851">The courts of Auditors of both countries have the intention, even after the completion of their joint project, to further develop the relevant findings for them and, if necessary, to refer them to the parliament and government of their country.</seg>
<seg id="852">Both audit bodies are also convinced that the principles of procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of supreme audit institutions (INTOSAI). This is because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic allocation of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the audit</seg>
<seg id="3">Preface</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes are the most important source of income for public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="5">One focus of the activity of the courts of auditors should therefore be on the audit of this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">This applies in particular to VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">This alone creates annual tax losses in the European Union of an estimated 100 billion Euro1.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the sixth EUROSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005, the participants already pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">This allows the audit courts to exchange audit approaches and optimize audit practice.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is particularly suitable for cooperation as it is harmonised within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2006, the courts of Auditors of both states examined the USt for the first time in parallel.</seg>
<seg id="12">The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the audit offices is required. This enables a comprehensive assessment to be made of whether the measures taken are suitable for effectively combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two audit courts decided to continue their cooperation and conducted a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany audit report</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Examination number: (CZ) 09/11 (d) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of audit: (CZ) administration of VAT (d) bilateral audit with the court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as NKÚ), control audit</seg>
<seg id="18">Audit objective:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) the VAT administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities for inter-state assistance should be examined.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) the audit should evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the auditors.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, further examination fields linked to the VAT should be processed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The findings made here should be compared in order to determine whether the taxation procedures can be optimized.</seg>
<seg id="23">The examination period was the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the examination period until the conclusion of the examination.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit</seg>
<seg id="25">The courts of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit for the administration of the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the previous parallel examination, they had uncovered suspected cases involving intra-community transactions,</seg>
<seg id="27">which made a further examination appear expedient.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the audit findings, the two audit courts made recommendations for the administration of the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aim of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the suspected cases identified should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The examination also dealt with other matters. These included selected cases of risky intra-community transactions, Mutual Administrative Assistance in the recovery of USt claims and USt verification in large companies.</seg>
<seg id="31">In doing so, the audit courts have determined:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Due to the previous testing recommendations</seg>
<seg id="33">* Recommendation 1: the rules for the registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In the first audit, the courts compared the registration procedures for VAT in the two states and found differences that caused problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">The court of auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxpayers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This was also taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment to council regulation no 1798/2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the VAT identification number.</seg>
<seg id="38">The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their possible deletion.</seg>
<seg id="39">The court of auditors expected member states to agree on appropriate rules in accordance with their policy decision to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">The member states reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN.</seg>
<seg id="41">The aforementioned common regulations are no longer contained therein. The two courts of auditors regret this.</seg>
<seg id="42">They still consider such regulations important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">* Recommendation 2: monthly submission of summary reports as a result of the first audit, the court of auditors recommended to the member states that summary reports (CM) should be submitted on a monthly basis in future.</seg>
<seg id="44">The amounts of intra-community transactions could then be checked more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of Value Added Tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-community transactions has reduced the deadline for submitting the CM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010. </seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the implementation only came into force on 1 July 2010. It has thus not transposed the duty to pay the monthly fee of the ZM into national law in due time.</seg>
<seg id="48">* Recommendation 3: data comparison of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the consolidation of the procedures for USt pre-registrations and ZM the German financial administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">* Recommendation 4: Exchange on successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level during the first audit, the two audit bodies agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one member state alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in every EU member state.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the member state with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The court of auditors noted that the two member states apply different risk management systems that have both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU-EUROCANET, while the Bundesrechnungshof focused on the German participation in the "platform for risk management".</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Control examination of selected intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the first audit, the courts of auditors jointly examined transactions for which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been declared differently by the taxpayers of the two states in the USt pre-declarations (or ust declarations) or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="58">The courts of auditors selected nine cases of intra-community deliveries of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany for the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="59">The examinations by the tax offices (FÄ) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel examination.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit has shown that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. The respective tax administrations had taken appropriate measures to this end (including subsequent VAT determinations or the Prevention of input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Audit of selected, high-risk intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">The audit also included highly risky intra-community transactions between EU taxpayers that were recorded in the Eurocanet System.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is used to identify risky taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member states may participate in this System on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive Status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the point of view of an active participating state, it is unsatisfactory that other member states refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.</seg>
<seg id="68">The NKU found both normal transactions and those with suspected USt fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.</seg>
<seg id="69">The FA were only able to check high-risk sales to a limited extent. This was especially true for so-called "Missing Traders", whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly enough to prove the taxable fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">In case of suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports</seg>
<seg id="71">it is recommended that Customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany and a number of other countries have rejected an active participation in EUROCANET because they do not believe that there is a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">The German Federal Audit Office (Bundesrechnungshof) found that the German tax administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="74">Nevertheless, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU member states.</seg>
<seg id="75">The EU Council agreed on a draft regulation,</seg>
<seg id="76">created by EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network for combating USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all member states.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany are processed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Bundesrechnungshof and the NKU compared the statistics submitted by both member states to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">These statistics contained discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two court of auditors consider a renewed discussion on the statistics at EU level to be useful in order to avoid any discrepancies that may still exist in the future.</seg>
<seg id="84">If this is not done, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the commission to support member states in their efforts to combat USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">Both courts of auditors believe that member states with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.</seg>
<seg id="88">The commission should assist the member states in this, if so desired.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. VAT testing in large companies</seg>
<seg id="90">The court of auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large companies in both states.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the tax authorities, which they considered important in this context.</seg>
<seg id="92">It became clear that the Situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="93">CZ has a system for the selection of high-risk cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss statements).</seg>
<seg id="94">Overall, the USt control can be effectively controlled and analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="95">A special tax office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is no comparable System in Germany. This complicates the control and analysis of the USt control as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="97">The German tax administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the USt pre-registrations or ust declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="98">Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Test procedure</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 examination procedure in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">Department II - state budget revenue and regional departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited in the period from May 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="102">Bodies audited by the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 ABIL: Finanzamt (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FA in Hodonín, FA in Hradec Králové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA in Písek, FA in Pilsen, FA Prague 1, FA Prague 4, FA Prague 8, FA in Rakovník were, FA in Sokolov, FA Tabor, FA in Vysoké Mýto, FA in Zlín and FA in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The Senate of the Czech court of auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 examination procedure in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich examined from February 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:</seg>
<seg id="107">* Bavaria, * Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, * Saxony. They also conducted Interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files from the following FA were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Central Tax Office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; * Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, special tax office Hamburg for large companies • * Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits of large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; * Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="109">Discussions were also held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 cooperation between the two courts of auditors</seg>
<seg id="112">Prior to the parallel audit, the representatives of both audit courts met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">In December 2008, the presidents of both courts signed the agreement on cooperation in parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams learned about the first results obtained during the exam preparation, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting took place from 2 to 4 December 2009 in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="116">The examination teams exchanged the examination findings gained up to that point and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint examination report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two courts of auditors identified the following topics for their parallel audit • * evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • review of selected cases of intra-community transactions between tax authorities from the Czech Republic and Germany that could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • review of selected intra-community transactions between tax authorities from the Czech Republic and Germany classified as risky; • review of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits for large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Audit of the administration of the VAT in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 implementation of the recommendations from the first joint test</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU supported</seg>
<seg id="124">following the results of the first audit, the Czech court of auditors recommended to adapt the requirements for VAT registration and to introduce new rules for the cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">These amended rules should more effectively limit the risk of possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="126">In certain cases, it was found that FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxpayers who did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No. 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT law").</seg>
<seg id="127">So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige FIES to cancel if taxpayers repeatedly do not submit VAT declarations.</seg>
<seg id="128">Under the Czech VAT Act, the FA may ex officio delete the registration of a taxpayer if: (a) the taxpayer has not made any transactions for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for doing so; (B) the taxpayer has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; (C) the taxpayer no longer fulfils the requirements for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="129">The first examination revealed that due to the existing legal situation, Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration "foreign taxable person"3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year. </seg>
<seg id="130">The Prague 1 company often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009. </seg>
<seg id="132">Accordingly, the FA is authorised to delete the registration of a foreign taxpayer if the latter has not provided taxable or tax-exempt goods or services with a right to deduct input tax in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly fee of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="135">Due to the first audit, the audit courts had recommended the introduction of the monthly levy of ZM.</seg>
<seg id="136">The council directive, which reduced the frequency of tax collection to one month, was implemented in the Czech Republic by the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010. </seg>
<seg id="137">The ZM must now be submitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="138">In addition, a ZM must be provided if services, the place of performance of which is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) VAT law, are provided for a person registered as liable to VAT in another member state.</seg>
<seg id="139">The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services. This obligation arises from council directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of Service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data this recommendation related to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">In its system ATIS4, the Czech tax administration automatically compares the data on intra-community transactions from the VAT declarations and the CM.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">The proper collection of VAT is an indispensable prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">Therefore, the fight against USt fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The significance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.</seg>
<seg id="148">In it, an external expert estimated the USt loss for the 25 member states in the period 2000 to 2006. After evaluation of the available data, the tax loss for the period mentioned was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros. It was based on the fact that the EU-25 loses an average of 12% of their turnover taxes each year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The estimated tax loss for the Czech Republic in 2006 was 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first audit found that a member state alone could not develop an effective risk management system (RMS).</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each member state.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the RMS, the Czech court of Auditors has examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).</seg>
<seg id="153">For this purpose, risk-bearing intra-community transactions exported by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The Eurofisc network aims to optimise administrative assistance in tax matters and combat VAT fraud more effectively. The cooperation of the competent authorities should be improved in order to detect fraud cases as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to estimate the risk potential in intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Rat6 already approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system. </seg>
<seg id="157">Eurocanet, developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with the other member states and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="158">The purpose of the system is to detect risky sales and identify entrepreneurs involved in organized USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 implementation of recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">Based on a detailed questionnaire, the German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this System to the commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The System itself is constantly being improved.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data provided in the questionnaire is now recorded electronically and will be available for later research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The commission had made a Proposal8 to amend regulation 1798/2003. This included common Standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">The member states still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of finance not to fall behind the Standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly fee of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, a Law9 implementing the EU directives into national law was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="173">Among other things, it contains provisions on the monthly levy of the ZM for intra-community deliveries</seg>
<seg id="174">and will enter into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations on the consolidation of the previously separate procedures for the submission of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint federal-state working group has been established,</seg>
<seg id="178">which has developed a concept for the Automatic Comparison of the data from the USt pre-registrations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="179">The concept is still being discussed with the countries.</seg>
<seg id="180">In addition, this working group dealt with a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level relevant information is exchanged at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported this Initiative and initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the "Fiscalis 2006-2007"action plan by means of a written procedure dated 18 October 2006. </seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform addressed the following topics in 4 subgroups: • risk management tools • * influencing the behavior of taxpayers, • evaluation, • updating the risk management guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports of the subgroups "risk management instruments" and "update of the risk management guidelines" were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The question of the requirements for USt registration and its deletion in various countries was dealt with at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amended council regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of Value Added Tax and repealing regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">This proposal also includes common Standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="192">The questions of registration and deletion are subject to the national legislation of the EU member states until further notice.</seg>
<seg id="193">The member states still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of finance not to fall behind the Standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">The member states reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010. </seg>
<seg id="196">Common rules for the registration and deletion of taxpayers are no longer contained therein.</seg>
<seg id="197">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="198">The two courts of auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly fee of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="201">With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous examination, it was recommended that all member states introduce the monthly tax of the CM in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of Value Added Tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-community transactions has reduced the frequency for the submission of the relevant CECs to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not implement the obligation to pay the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus not on time, while the CZ complied with the requirements of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations on the consolidation of the previously separate procedures for the submission of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM</seg>

<seg id="210">The Czech court of auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">The Bundesrechnungshof focused on German participation in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 inspection of selected intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">In the first examination, transactions were examined jointly for which there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or where discrepancies had been found in the declarations of taxable persons in both member states.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two courts of auditors selected nine cases of intra-community deliveries of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany for the audit, where the tax audit by the FA of the member state concerned had not been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth 22 686 euros from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration,since the German tax obligation in the period mentioned had no VAT identification number, but only a tax number for domestic sales.</seg>
<seg id="218">Through international assistance under Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that under German VAT law the supplier of intra-community goods does not need a VAT identification number in order to qualify for tax exemption for intra-community goods deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="219">The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that - according to the audit by the competent Czech FA-the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration in which he declared the purchase of goods of the above value and at the same time asserted his right to deduct input tax in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased goods worth 12,561 euros from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="222">However, he stated that he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not explain them in his USt statement.</seg>
<seg id="223">Citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German tax administration refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech FA could not obtain any documents, the tax audit was unsuccessful and the original tax assessment was passed.</seg>
<seg id="225">The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous reports from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the relevant delivery of goods to a Slovak addressee.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and indicated the acquisition in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased a car worth 48,500 euros from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, he did not declare any intra-community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, he had not made a USt declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information provided from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA requested the taxpayer to submit a subsequent tax return in March 2007, but the taxpayer refrained from doing so.</seg>
<seg id="232">The audit found that the FA had carried out further audits in this tax case in 2007. It had established that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the tax period December 2004, fixing additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase of goods from another member state and their resale.</seg>
<seg id="234">The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings on the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be irrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer is reported to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) with a total value of 198,167 euros to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="238">In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, it was stated that a tax criminal proceedings were pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">The audit of the Bundesrechnungshof found that after the conclusion of the procedure there was evidence of involvement of the German taxpayer in fraud.</seg>
<seg id="240">The intra-community acquisition of goods was subject to taxation of 182 424 euros (for 2004) and 369 690 euros (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information from the German tax administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">Based on the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA set additional VAT of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">Czech taxpayer A is said to have purchased a machine with a total value of 58,000 euros from a German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="246">In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer is said to have supplied Czech taxpayer B with a machine worth 88 027 euros. However, B denied the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with a branch in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">Czech taxpayer A did not state the purchase of goods from the aforementioned German taxpayer in his VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="249">The response of the German FA to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but a delivery within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the inspection, the German Federal Audit Office (Bundesrechnungshof) found that the intra-community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after completion of an audit and the exemption from VAT was subsequently refused.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer was reported to have delivered goods worth 11,600 euros to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were acquired and later, i.e. in 2005, sold in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="254">The audit carried out by the Czech court of auditors revealed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which inadmissibly identified acquisitions from another member state, including those in the amount mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="255">The Bundesrechnungshof found that after receiving a reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and fixed additional VAT of 1,600 euros.</seg>
<seg id="256">Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an examination is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="257">The ZM of the German taxpayer has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxpayer who has surrendered the ZM can also correct it.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The competent Czech company received from the German tax administration a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the issue of the purchase of a car worth 47,400 euros by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After an audit for the tax period 2005, the Czech FA determined the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer with CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT-payer had been cancelled because he had not fulfilled his tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="262">The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer has so far not corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax notice.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer delivered goods to a Czech taxpayer with a total value of 33,205 euros, which the latter did not declare as an intra-community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="266">In the audit of the Czech court of auditors, it was found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer repeatedly issued subsequent VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of CZK 134 273 acquired in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this by the fact that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately attributed, and accepted the submitted VAT declarations.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer delivered goods worth 46 854 euros to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-community acquisition of goods worth only 14 856 euros.</seg>
<seg id="272">As part of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA checked the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="273">With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of 31 998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="274">According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech court of auditors, the Czech taxpayer submitted a subsequent VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period in January 2007, following repeated reminders from the FA.</seg>
<seg id="275">With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct input tax. His tax liability for the relevant tax period therefore remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including subsequent VAT fixing or prevention of VAT refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 examination of selected cases of risky intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be a significant source of information to identify high-risk taxpayers in the member state of acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the competent FA with the acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has introduced information on sales and taxable suppliers deemed to be at risk into the Eurocanet System.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,</seg>
<seg id="283">which had been entered into the EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other member states either as suppliers or purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="284">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German tax administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">During the audit, both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other USt fraud were detected.</seg>
<seg id="287">In these cases, the FA exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,</seg>
<seg id="288">E. G.:</seg>
<seg id="289">* The FA did not detect any suspicion of risky sales during the examination of the early warning information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The relevant taxpayers were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">* During the verification of risky transactions, FAs were unable to prove, on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, violations of the rules on the calculation of the tax base and the VAT, although they found discrepancies in the Transport and storage of the goods or uncovered business relationships with letterbox companies from other member states.</seg>
<seg id="292">* The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the FAS and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The competent FA reviewed most of the risky taxpayers and transactions mentioned in Eurocanet's early warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="294">However, your options for checking risky sales, especially so-called "Missing Traders", are limited.</seg>
<seg id="295">In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly prove that the taxpayer acted fraudulently.</seg>
<seg id="296">Stricter requirements for the registration of taxpayers for USt purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would be helpful to combat USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="297">Taxpayers involved in fraudulent merry-go-round transactions can be registered for VAT purposes in order to fake fictitious deliveries of goods throughout the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to other taxpayers, with which they can then assert unjustified claims for deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="298">In case of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that Customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="299">Member states may participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large member states (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a eurofisc network with mandatory participation.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 findings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">They served as the basis for the selection of six German Taxpayers whose files were reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="304">Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">That is why Germany has a passive Status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal government</seg>
<seg id="307">no unquestionable legal basis [exists] that would allow the existing tax secrecy in Germany to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the federal government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET.“12 since October 2007, the federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting them to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German Faes receive control notifications about the direct business relationships recorded in EUROCANET between the taxpayers registered with them and companies from other EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the respective German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU member state has business relations with a company resident in another member state which is also in business relations with the German company from the control notification.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive Status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other member states refuse active participation.</seg>
<seg id="314">Accordingly, the examination had to be carried out differently in this area.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, significant differences in the success of the detection of VAT fraud could not be determined. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other instruments at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft Regulation13 which created EUROFISC, a network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by the member states at European level and incorporated into this network.</seg>
<seg id="319">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="320">The cases brought to court at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the member states and the commission on the conditions for tax exemption for intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:</seg>
<seg id="324">Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the system of financing the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund, and of levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">Council Directive 2001/44 / EC amending Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the system of financing the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund, as well as levies and customs duties and VAT and certain excise duties; and</seg>
<seg id="326">Commission directive 2002/94 / EC laying down detailed implementing rules for certain articles of Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain taxes, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308/EEC by Law No. 252/2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">After the adoption of council directive 2001/44 / EC, this too had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, an amendment to the aforementioned law was required.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, legislative amendment No. 191/2004 concerning intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new relevant legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) no 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008. </seg>
<seg id="331">The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009.  Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify that all documents sent are in conformity with the respective Original.</seg>
<seg id="332">Essential principles of international administrative assistance for the recovery of claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. It is the principle of reciprocity applies ;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. Mutual Assistance shall only be provided upon request and upon fulfilment of all requirements;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. Administrative Assistance does not extend to claims that are considered a criminal sanction in the requested state;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. The procedure of the inter-governmental mutual assistance for the recovery of the receivables must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested state ;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. In the recovery process foreign claims do not have priority over domestic claims;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. The assistance will only be provided for the recovery of indisputable claims ;</seg>
<seg id="339">7.the principle of exhaustion shall apply: the requesting state shall use all means available to it under national law to recover the claim.</seg>
<seg id="340">Law No. 191/2004 provides for three forms of administrative assistance: provision of Information, Notification of legal acts and actual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states</seg>
<seg id="342">The competent FA shall transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery together with the relevant documents electronically to the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic via the relevant financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic shall arrange for the translation of the request into the relevant language, scan it with all attachments and transmit it to the competent tax authority of the state concerned via the communication network or the common interface CCN/CSI.</seg>
<seg id="344">A request for recovery assistance must meet the following requirement: the claim must exceed 1,500 euros and must not be older than five years.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for incoming requests from other member states</seg>
<seg id="347">The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic must confirm receipt of requests from other member states as soon as possible and within seven days at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">If it decides not to grant the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, indicating the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="349">The corresponding notification shall be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the acknowledgement of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of finance checks whether the request meets all legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="351">It shall then forward the request to the competent FA via the relevant financial Directorate. If the request for recovery is granted, the FA shall, among other things, determine the debtor's financial situation, e.g. by extracts from the land register, inquiring about existing bank accounts and registering cars with the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="352">After six months from the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic shall inform the requesting authority of the result of the investigations carried out.</seg>
<seg id="353">The requesting authority must also be informed if the relevant taxpayers are not available and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="354">All sums successfully recovered must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech FA dealing with recovery May, with the consent of the requesting state, agree on the demand for hours or instalments.</seg>
<seg id="356">Interest or surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of delay pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 on the management of taxes and fees</seg>
<seg id="357">to the requesting state.</seg>
<seg id="358">In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic delayed sending the recovery requests to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="359">The same applied to the forwarding of requests for recovery made by the Czech FA to the competent authority in the requested state.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit revealed that the Ministry of Finance has violated the law on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims. It had failed to inform the Competent Authority of the requesting member state of the status of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="361">The Situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical Data</seg>
<seg id="363">Pursuant to Section 13 (4) of law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic produces statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year.  This contains the number of requests for Information, Notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims, submitted in the previous year and received.</seg>
<seg id="364">On the basis of the data provided by the member states, the European Commission shall draw up its report to the council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit revealed that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic reported the claims to be 5 250 000 Euros too low. The reason for this was the incorrect indication of the amount of a VAT claim submitted in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns into euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>

<seg id="369">The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is council directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC recovery directive)14 and Commission Regulation (EC) no 1178/2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC implementing directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC recovery directive codified Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times. </seg>
<seg id="371">Among other things, it regulates the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including The Associated interest, fees and late payment surcharges.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC recovery directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (eg)17 of 3 May 2003. </seg>

<seg id="407">Only on February 26, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a lien.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since the encumbered land was not sufficient to pay the entire tax debt, an instalment payment agreement of at least CZK 2,000 per month was made with the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="410">An interim report was sent to the German FA on August 31, 2009.  As a result, the taxpayer had meanwhile paid tax debts of CZK 49 600 (as of August 25, 2009).</seg>
<seg id="411">The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on August 28, 2009, a further CZK 3,000 was transferred.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer amounting to a total of 180 869 euros (= CZK 4 434 915).</seg>
<seg id="414">It was only on 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA. </seg>
<seg id="415">After checking the bank balance, securities, real estate, motor vehicles, and other movable property, the FA determined that the debtor did not have pledgable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Local investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in CZ were unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">The Czech Ministry of Finance received this notification on 6 April 2009 and forwarded it to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009. </seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT plus interest and fees totalling EUR 3 139 (= CZK 84 846).</seg>
<seg id="421">It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance was informed from Germany that the Czech tax debtor had paid the debt in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case was closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully paid his debt in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the debt was also settled in the Czech Republic under the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to the long time required by the Czech Ministry of finance to forward the Information to the FA, the tax debt was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the Federal Audit Office, it has been determined that the amount recovered will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounts to 6 649 euros and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the documents of the Czech Ministry of finance, there was only a request for recovery of EUR 3 139 for the company in question. The recovery request in the amount of 6 649 Euro was not to be found there.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling 39 957 euros = 956 654 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="429">Only on 19 December 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="430">The recovery procedure was initiated on 1 June 2009. A decision was taken to seize the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros per month in the past, but the responsible German FA did not agree with this.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxpayer agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech court of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax in 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007 together with interest and fees amounting to a total of 113 444 euros = 3 116 304 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="437">Only on November 14, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to Prague 1, which is authorised to deal with tax cases of non-resident taxpayers; a locally competent FA could not be determined on the basis of the available address.</seg>
<seg id="438">During its investigation, the FA received information and documents on September 19th, 2008, stating that the debtor's income was 4,704 euros. However, it could not issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order for the seizure of the debtor's assets with credit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech court of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested inter-state assistance in the recovery of a VAT debt together with procedural costs amounting to a total of CZK 146 223 742.</seg>
<seg id="443">Only on 13 May 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA, through the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of 17,700 euros = 439 226 CZK recovered through account attachment.</seg>
<seg id="445">A conversion error was discovered when checking the amounts recovered.</seg>
<seg id="446">The amount to be recovered was 146 223 742 CZK converted at the exchange rate of 1 euro = 25.065 CZK, but due to a comma error the amount was 583 378 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct amount to be recovered was 5 833 782 euros.</seg>
<seg id="448">As a result, a recovery request was submitted that was 5 250 404 euros too low.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery of a VAT debt together with interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer amounting to a total of CZK 1,970,632 = EUR 79,847.</seg>
<seg id="451">Only on 10 November 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="452">The German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears on February 4, 2009.</seg>
<seg id="453">Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's sales in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009, as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax debt. On 8 April 2009 - 4 600 euros, on 6 May 2009 -3 000 euros and on 16 June 2009 - 2 500 euros. </seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On June 23, 2009, a further payment of 2,500 euros was agreed between the debtor and the FA until June 30, 2009. </seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">On 22 May 2008, the Czech FA requested recovery of tax debts totalling 398 653 euros = CZK 9 832 779, which included property transfer tax.</seg>
<seg id="458">Only on 2 October 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="459">In a letter dated 3 April 2009 from the German tax administration to the Czech Ministry of finance, the request was returned. </seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration reasoned that the real estate transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">In addition, Article 2 (g) concerns liabilities arising from taxes on income and property.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55 / EC applies to taxes on income and property not mentioned in Article 1, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed that a new request for recovery be sent to the German tax administration, which should no longer include the property transfer tax arrears in the amount of CZK 61 759, but instead the arrears in VAT, corporation tax and income tax.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of finance a request for recovery of income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 = 123 328 euros.</seg>
<seg id="467">The VAT debt was 1 133 967 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="468">Only on 18 April 2007 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration</seg>
<seg id="469">and it was only on 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech FA the response of the German Finance Administration of 9 July 2007,</seg>
<seg id="470">according to which the German FA had issued an enforcement order for the seizure of the bank account on 11 June 2007.  The Bank stated that it was not in business relations with the named taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="471">The request was therefore deemed to have been settled for the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of finance a request for recovery of VAT debts totalling CZK 1,296,845 = 43,591 euros.</seg>
<seg id="474">The competent Finance Directorate sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005. </seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German Finance Administration on 15 December 2005. </seg>
<seg id="476">Before submitting the request, the Czech FA executed the tax claim by seizing the bank accounts and salary seizing as well as by encumbering a property.</seg>
<seg id="477">Prior to the request for recovery, a request for information was submitted to the German tax administration on 16 March 2005. </seg>
<seg id="478">According to a reply to the Czech FA dated September 16, 2005, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from non-self-employment amounting to 8,437 euros.  On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the recovery request and only forwarded it to the relevant Czech FA on 12 February 2008. </seg>
<seg id="479">According to this, the tax debt in Germany is irrecoverable due to the debtor's insolvency.</seg>
<seg id="480">No property had been determined, the income from non-self-employment was already subject to other enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German financial administration thus considered the request to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU member states for intergovernmental assistance.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The Federal Court of justice and the NKÚ have compared the statistics submitted by the two member states to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">There were discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that member states take greater care in compiling their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 200921, the commission came to the conclusion that, despite a greater number of requests for assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics had become less pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both courts of auditors consider a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics to be useful, so that the remaining disagreements can be avoided in the future.</seg>
<seg id="490">If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the court of auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of amounts recovered per member state.</seg>
<seg id="492">By analysing more closely the statistics presented by the member states, the commission could help member states to assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">Since the recovery rate can be calculated per member state, the court of auditors advocates that member states with a low rate should aim at at least the average recovery rate within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the request of a member state, the commission could play an active role in this.</seg>
<seg id="495">The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the competent FAS with delay, especially in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="496">The same applies to the recovery requests submitted by the Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="497">The audit showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance violated law no. 191/2004 on inter-state recovery assistance in so far as it did not inform the Competent Authority of the requesting member state of the progress of recovery measures within the six-month period following receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 VAT verification at large companies</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 VAT audit at large companies in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General</seg>
<seg id="501">The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="502">The audit of large companies is regulated in Czech Law No. 337/1992, the "tax and Fee Administration Act".</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been set up to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the tax period concerned is at least CZK 2 billion according to income tax returns or corporate tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Taxable Person is classified as a large company on the basis of the turnover according to income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003. </seg>
<seg id="505">A natural or legal person will no longer be run as a large business for the purposes of VAT if, in three consecutive Tax Periods, its net turnover during the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period for which, according to the tax return, the conditions were fulfilled for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="506">A taxpayer can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been previously checked for a tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">By the end of 2009, all large companies had been audited at least every five years.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on the proper tax determination and collection.</seg>
<seg id="509">The Fä audits should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="510">The large companies subject to tax were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent FA, which were set up for a total of 13 FA.</seg>
<seg id="511">A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the specifications of the head of the financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition, it also tested</seg>
<seg id="513">Taxpayers with unusual and special business activities; and</seg>
<seg id="514">those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.</seg>
<seg id="515">Taxpayers with complex location distribution and organizational structure are also examined,</seg>
<seg id="516">Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion</seg>
<seg id="517">as well as taxpayers belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information on the number of tests carried out by the special examination bodies of the FA and the additional tax results of these tests are shown in Table No. 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No. 531/1990 for the regional tax authorities. In particular, the establishment of a special tax office with nationwide jurisdiction for selected taxpayers (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least € 1 million) will be considered. 2 billion CZK).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 VAT audit at large companies in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General</seg>
<seg id="522">The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. The general regulations • of the Tax Ordinance (AO), • of the Finance Administration Act (fvg) and • of the audit regulations (BPO) apply to audits.</seg>
<seg id="523">There are also work aids.</seg>
<seg id="524">Tax regulations</seg>
<seg id="525">The provisions of § § 193 to 203 AO "Section 4-external audit" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its scope, allocation of responsibilities, Form and content of the audit notice, audit principles, obligations of the taxpayer to cooperate and requirements for final discussions as well as for the transmission of the audit report.</seg>
<seg id="526">External audits are carried out by the competent FA (§ 195 AO).</seg>
<seg id="527">Financial Administration Act according to § 5 Paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with § 19, it is the responsibility of the federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits of the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and scope of this cooperation shall be agreed between the authorities involved.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the federal Central Tax Office may require that certain companies it designates be audited at a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="530">In this case, it may lay down rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="531">Audit regulations in accordance with Article 108 paragraph 7 GG, the audit regulations (BPO 2000) were adopted with the approval of the Federal Council.</seg>
<seg id="532">It applies to external audits of the state financial authorities and the federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">According to § 3 BpO, companies are regularly classified in size classes.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large companies are to be subjected to a connection test (Section 5). 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">Pursuant to Section 33.1 BpO, each competent tax authority is required to keep a group directory within the meaning of the regulation.</seg>
<seg id="536">Working aids for the administration</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the following work aids were issued for the administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">* "Uniform Manual for the USt special examination“;</seg>
<seg id="539">* VAT-countries - online USLO (=dialogue system in the intra-community VAT control procedure) with instructions on the use of the data contained in the MIAS on intra-community business relations;</seg>
<seg id="540">* Work aids for difficult and special situations.</seg>
<seg id="541">* Central database for the storage and evaluation of VAT fraud cases and development of risk profiles-spells;</seg>
<seg id="542">Taxpayers are classified in size classes. These are based on criteria such as turnover and profit, although the limits vary depending on the branch of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The Figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">The values are reviewed every three years and determined for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies - not only large companies - is to be determined regularly (last reporting date: 1 January 2010).</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, large companies are to be checked without gaps.</seg>
<seg id="547">The examinations are announced and usually also extend to the USt,</seg>
<seg id="548">this means that the examination covers all relevant taxes, namely income tax, corporation tax, commercial tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="549">The value added tax can be checked either by auditors or VAT special auditors.</seg>
<seg id="550">The practice is different and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">The BPO 2000 assumes three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes to which a company has been assessed are subject to audit.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 management of the VAT audit at large companies</seg>
<seg id="555">According to the agreement, both audit courts did not examine individual cases. They investigated the question of how the tax authorities proceed with the VAT audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="556">With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the tax authorities that is essential for the audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="557">* Which statistical records and evaluations for VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?</seg>
<seg id="558">Especially:</seg>
<seg id="559">* Are there Statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between VAT fraud prevention and general VAT audit?</seg>
<seg id="560">CZ: no, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: the tax administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.</seg>
<seg id="562">* Are there Statistics or records of the timeliness of exams?</seg>
<seg id="563">CZ: information on the timeliness of audits of intra-community acquisitions of selected VAT-payers is recorded in the ATIS System;</seg>
<seg id="564">the same applies to information about the beginning and end of the examination of the company.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: no, the statistics for auditors summarized at federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT special auditors focus on the last VAT assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.</seg>
<seg id="568">The statistics for VAT special auditors kept at federal level do not contain information on the size class of the audited company.</seg>
<seg id="569">* Are there Statistics or records of the type of surplus result; e.g. divided by:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. real surplus result (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general VAT rate)</seg>
<seg id="571">II. incorrect surplus result (e.g. relocation/postponement of a matter not to be objected to under VAT law to another tax period)</seg>
<seg id="572">III. Cash effectivity (payment of the set more income)</seg>
<seg id="573">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech Tax Administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of tax surplus broken down by type of tax, the number of audited taxpayers and the number of audited tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (on-site investigations, Dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Regardless of this, the amount of additional payments and incoming payments are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by type of tax. However, there is no distinction between tax debts incurred as a result of a tax return and those arising from audit procedures of the FA.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: no, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not distinguish according to the above criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Most tax authorities, where local surveys were carried out, did not differentiate in this respect either.</seg>
<seg id="580">* Are Exam fields with results recorded?</seg>
<seg id="581">CZ: yes, the FA can select examination cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS System.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="585">Accordingly, auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved when a certain threshold value is exceeded in ZAUBER.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. on the origin of the VAT surplus.</seg>
<seg id="587">* Which are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="589">- Large taxable companies have unjustifiably claimed input tax deduction for purchased supplies and services,</seg>
<seg id="590">* which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity according to § 72 (1) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="591">* which were used for representation expenses in accordance with § 75 (3) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="592">* due to invoices that do not comply with the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG</seg>
<seg id="593">- large companies subject to tax have failed to register the VAT to be paid as provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="596">Findings on VAT from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, the federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database, in which auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="598">* Does the financial administration analyse audit fields with significant results and draw conclusions for Strategic Management?</seg>
<seg id="599">CZ: yes, for example, nationwide inspections are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide any information about particularly "productive" audit fields.</seg>
<seg id="602">With regard to the analysis of such information, the usefulness and the way in which it was further used, there were different views among the survey bodies.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some financial directorates provide such information to FAs, but FAs are free to use it or not.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the System.</seg>
<seg id="606">CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases based on a wide range of information.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the evaluation and Management of VAT audits in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In the Czech Republic, the establishment of a special tax office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="610">Accordingly, it is more difficult to fulfill these tasks in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="611">The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="612">This segment ISIN tention ally left blank</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of the information in USt pre-registrations or ust declarations as well as audit instructions, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.</seg>
<seg id="614">Appropriate management processes and risk management systems should be introduced to reduce revenue shortfalls at VAT and at the same time increase the risk of discovery for unreliable entrepreneurs.</seg>

<seg id="618">The cooperation between the two courts of Auditors has proved its worth.</seg>
<seg id="619">In this way, it was possible to gain necessary insights into the systems used in both countries: this concerns in particular: • intra-Community Sales, • Risk Management at USt in particular with regard to the selection of risky sales, • recovery of UST claims and • USt audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="620">The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting USt fraud and in the systems described above.</seg>
<seg id="621">These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="622">They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested parties about which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud. This applies, for example, to the relationship within and between the member states and the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The experience and knowledge gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of the USt in the future.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communique</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the presidents of the Czech court of auditors and the Federal Court of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="626">Status of Information: June 2010.</seg>
