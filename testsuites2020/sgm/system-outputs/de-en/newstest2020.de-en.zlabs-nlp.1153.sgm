<seg id="3">High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and increasing living standards in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ensuring a rapid, safe, reliable and economic movement of persons and goods is an important task for the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="6">It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial efforts.</seg>
<seg id="7">When developing and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises must often be made with European and national political objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of transport infrastructure is elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="9">When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save significant financial resources through careful action and decisions and use them for other useful purposes.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of state auditing authorities is the recognition of deficiencies, which are in line with an optimum of austerity, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness in the case of expenditure on the construction of transport plants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit authorities are to draw attention not only to the shortcomings identified, but also to suggestions for improvement for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two supreme auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ), parallel audits of expenditure for the construction of the Prague – Dresden (Autobahn D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany) were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two motorways are linked to the border bridge jointly financed by both states.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooperation with the NKÚ allowed the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the middle use in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">The NKÚ received German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons in the course of cooperation with the BRH data.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the progress of planning, the date of completion was finally set at the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the awarding process, the road and motorway management of the Czech Republic (RMD) was bugs that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the Contractor was therefore closed later than planned.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint examination activity, the prices of motorway bridges were compared to the D 8 and the A 17. The size of the bridges was the size of the bridges.</seg>
<seg id="24">A price analysis of statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis showed that the border bridge among the major bridges with lengths of over 100 m was the most expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was also due to the increase in prices resulting from the delays in awarding.</seg>
<seg id="27">The comparison of prices in tunnel construction plants shows that the prices of tunnels are significantly higher in the course of the D 8 than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">In future audits of the cost-effectiveness of expenditure on transport infrastructure, both BRH and NKÚ can rely on a collection of bridges and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both courts recommend to standardize bridge constructions and to carry out steel composite and special constructions only where clamping concrete constructions are inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit process was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel examination, the auditors of both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of this report is the parallel tests of expenditure in the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The audit priorities were austerity, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel tests led the BRH in Germany and the NKÚ in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The NKÚ examined austerity, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the expenditure on the border section 0807 of the highway D 8 in the amount of rd. 20 billion CZK gross (rd. 690 million €.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million from EU Structural Funds (ISPA) is provided.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the parallel tests with the NKÚ in 2003 to 2005, the BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="40">From the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of approx. EUR 670 million will be cofinanced by €277 million from European funds (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The Prague – Dresden motorway is part of the pan-European transport corridor IV Dresden – Central and South-Eastern Europe – Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech/German border,</seg>
<seg id="43">the A 17 from the border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the examination, the cross-border sections of the motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both sections have been released for traffic on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the motorway is therefore finished on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 is still in the planning phase for a length of 16,4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice.</seg>
<seg id="47">The crossing of a landscape reserve in the Bohemian Central Mountains is envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="48">After Czech forecasts from 2001 the traffic volume in 2008 will be in the border section 0807 of the highway D 8 to 22 940 Kfz per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">German forecasts appreciate the traffic volume on the A 17 on the Czech border in 2010. 25 000 car per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a contract for the merger of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 at the common state border by establishing a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this single-aum measure was an important aspect of the parallel tests of both invoices.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="53">From mid-2005 onwards, both courts of auditors presented joint reflections on cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague – Dresden highway.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany is partly financed by the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech road construction management.</seg>
<seg id="58">For the BRH there was no possibility of examining this construction project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The NKÚ did not have comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with a view to the overall construction costs of bridges and tunnels at the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The NKÚ also had to examine the effectiveness of expenditure. To this end, the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels should be examined, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">After preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courts of auditors closed an agreement on the coordination of the tests of the Prague – Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="64">The auditors of both courts met in about six to eight weeks' time in the course of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="65">They dealt with current problems and tasks. They drew up a uniform methodology for examining bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and created joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">The current exchange of information was essential in terms of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH mainly devoted itself to comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels, as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ predominantly drew up the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Germany and in the Czech Republic, the legal bases of financial control and thus also the way the two courts of auditors complete their examinations differ.</seg>
<seg id="69">That is why both authorities drew up separate national reports on their audit results.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report takes account of the results of the two parallel tests.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communiqués in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 Treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge as far as possible in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">Later, it postponed the appointment by consensus at the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD was the client of the tree measure.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany is financing the bridge building to 42.13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">First, the RMD provided for a clamping concrete construction for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="78">However, the RMD agreed in 1999 with its German partner on the construction of a steel composite construction.</seg>
<seg id="79">They justified this decision with the possible reduction in the number of pillars of seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the Talks.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had designated the steel composite construction as the cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, there was a calculation error for this.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation was carried out by a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, however, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the procurement procedure, the RMD had serious errors,</seg>
<seg id="85">by inadequately described the lending documents and inaccurate both value criteria and accommodation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="86">These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments of the assessment commission and the Director-General of the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="87">An inferior bidder cooks the result of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The following study of the Czech antitrust was delayed by the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a result, this was lost the following summer construction season in 2004 and the total construction time was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time. This led to a significant increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="91">The measures offered included the double assembly of the superstructures, the amendment of the pillar form and the establishment of an assembly hall.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the contractor was unable to obtain the originally planned steel grades.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new steel variety – its higher costs of rd. € 4 million of the client was alone – allowed the construction time for the corrosion protection to be shortened and thus the overall construction time.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the offer price of rd. 18,3 million € net will significantly increase the overall cost of the border bridge through the acceleration measures and further returns.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened construction time led to a price increase of around €5.9 million alone.</seg>
<seg id="96">The costs are currently due to rd. 25,9 million € net (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both courts investigated the bridge prices at the D 8 and the A 17 to identify the bridges that were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The investigation was based on mathematical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels at the D 8 were compared to similar tunnels to the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4 because there were similar tunnels at the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="101">In preparing this part of the examination, a precise definition of the concept of prices was important.</seg>
<seg id="102">For comparison of bridge prices, both invoices agreed to use detailed requirements, such as using the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="103">(The MWSt rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and can change.), the cost of special founding measures not to take into account the currency exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005. (29 CZK = 1 €).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of various types of construction (steel concrete, clamping concrete, steel composite and steel) and various sizes are available both at the D 8 and at the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge buildings, the bridges were grouped according to their design.</seg>
<seg id="106">The analyses also taken into account the bridge size within these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">On both sides of the border, concrete bridges (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17 were very common.</seg>
<seg id="108">The investigation focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistics and improved the reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The test showed that the m2 price of the concrete bridges at the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the square metre price.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than in Czech bridges (see below illustrations).</seg>
<seg id="111">On the A 17 two, on the D 8 four bridges were found with significantly increased price.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges have been determined partly by means of a method for detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between the price of bridges and size (anhand of the distance to the regression curve can be identified atypically expensive bridges).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, the atypical high price of these bridges should only serve as a point of reference to which bridges should be concentrated.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw final conclusions, the causes of the respective high price must be identified in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">This could, for example, be on an unprofitable administration, but also on the requirements for protecting the environment or on other legitimate reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German (see table 1) the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length had expected the Czech concrete bridges to be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">In addition, the labour costs lower in the Czech Republic in relation to Germany spoke.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, when evaluating the results, the price of concrete bridges at the D 8 was higher than at the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">In the case of joint meetings, two causes were identified for this situation:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, construction orders for bridges are mainly awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="122">This also allows small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of major orders for the construction of several kilometres long motorway sections.</seg>
<seg id="124">Orders of this magnitude cannot be managed by medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, the diversity of the built bridges is greater than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the NKÚ found that the construction of bridges was laid down long before construction.</seg>
<seg id="128">, even when submitting the application to plan fixed by the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this time, you select a certain bridge building variant from several alternatives. However, the cost-effectiveness plays a minor role in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">Only by means of a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would a final conclusion be possible with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have sprayed the framework of this review.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive steel group bridge on the D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">The prices for the tunnels at the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels at the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany did not make any significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The significant price differences may be the result of a low-developed competition for tunnel buildings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow general conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Wirtschaftlichkeit und Wirksamkeit der Autobahn Dresden – Prag</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the development of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The gradual expansion of the D 8 was foreseen from Prague to the state border to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">The section 0805 should be built by the Bohemian Central Mountains before the border section 0807 close to the border.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic finances the D 8 in the context of programme funding.</seg>
<seg id="142">The number 327 220 “Bau der Motor D 8 Prague – Ústí nad Labem – Czech German state border” defines two objectives:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">as a national goal: to improve the link between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">as an international goal: the link between Prague and Berlin as part of the pan-European traffic corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.</seg>
<seg id="147">The programme envisaged to complete the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the end of construction works is not identical at the time of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The NKÚ found that the plan was adopted for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental organisations have complained against this decision.</seg>
<seg id="151">A legally binding judgment is still under way.</seg>
<seg id="152">Compared to the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, a delay in the completion of the section No.0805 was not to be ruled out by several years.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport presented a postponement of the completion date of the construction section No.</seg>
<seg id="154">Due to this, the construction of the border section reached does not reach the national objective of improving the link between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD subjected the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 and section No.0805 by the Bohemian Central Mountains in 1999 to 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">As an investment costs, they set them out. 639 million € for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of cost-effectiveness examination (EIRR = Intern interest foot)</seg>
<seg id="158">The opening of all planned motorways and highways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic in the northern part of the border section 18 000 car per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">Opening of all planned motorways and highways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Traffic in the northern part of the border section 22 000 car per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">Opening of all planned motorways and highways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic in the northern part of the border section 25 000 car per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The cost-effectiveness study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the close and leading section of the Bohemian Central Mountains is under traffic at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the examination, it was obvious that the section was not opened to the original date by the Bohemian Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="166">This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The costs of both sections were €897 million without VAT at 897 million. and thus 27,4% higher than in the 2001 economic view.</seg>
<seg id="168">In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will get another more expensive inienced inienced, which would affect the cost-effectiveness of the project.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic view showed that the construction of both highway sections in a daily traffic volume of at least 18 000 carcasses per day is economically justified in 2010.The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22 940 Kfz per day.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, a study on transmission routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains is based on a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 car per day in 2007. The project is then under the cost-effectiveness limit.</seg>
<seg id="171">A higher volume of traffic on the routes to replace the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains is likely to lead to congestion and thus increased external costs, which have not been taken into account in the original cost-effectiveness study.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increasing costs means that the already low EIRR will not be achieved for the construction of the border close to the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the border section of the D 8 is therefore unprofitable.</seg>
<seg id="174">In the construction of the A 17 there were also cost increases such as the construction of the two o. g. sections of the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the context of the macroeconomic assessment for the Federal Traffic Traffic Plan in 1992, the Federal Ministry of Investment of Investment costs of rd. €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">In order for it to be a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, the costs have become rd. €670 million increased and the benefits/cost ratio reduced by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">Regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in 2003 to 2005, the BRH had examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="179">He found that the authority responsible for authorising the third part of the A 17 was called for.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the course of the examination, the Federal Ministry and the Road Building Administration were able to convince the BRH of the superfluousness of the landscape tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="181">This has enabled €10 million to be avoided in construction costs and 150 000 € at annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">When examining the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the tree measure was insufficiently prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">In the planning phase, road construction management renounced a state-of-the-art version of the rock on the surface of the woods, as it was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was only when the tunnel company reached the wall that it did so.</seg>
<seg id="186">It was shown that the rock was more impaired than accepted in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">Appropriate measures such as anchorages, injections and stone protection networks for around 3.3 million€ have been necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road construction management was not only the cost of additional, already necessary, and the safeguarding of the wood wall, but also for those who would not have been necessary at a proper preparation of construction.</seg>
<seg id="189">These include expenditure as a result of strangling construction processes (€3.2 million), additional processing of the lecture team (0.5 million€) and increased wages and material prices due to the construction time extension (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">This additional expenditure of around 10.7 million€ is not added to any added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">The BRH took these and other measures on the occasion of calling on the Federal Ministry to carry out the specialist supervision of large road construction.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, it should insist that road construction administrations introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">The benefits of the cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation met the expectations of both invoices.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both courts of auditors developed a database of bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future tests.</seg>
<seg id="196">The NKÚ found that the most important construction parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadways of the D 8 are not different from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of both invoices gathered on the cooperation gathered valuable experience, which will be useful in future tests.</seg>

<seg id="2">Preface</seg>
<seg id="3">The declaration of Lima, which was adopted in 1977, emphasises that the courts of auditors are empowered to examine the entire public finances.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration calls for the courts to have the power to examine the tax collection as broadly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The organisation of the European top audit authorities (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thematic focus of the VI. EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the most important steps on the road to optimising the testing activity of a Court of Auditors is to draw up a special strategy for examining public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This applies in particular to taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, there can be a situation in which national courts of auditors can only carry out their examination activities in cooperation with the courts of auditors of other states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As an example, the examination of international organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the fight against such crimes, cooperation between the authorities is required.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Court of Auditors, which examines in this area, must be prepared to cooperate closely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea for an examination of the value added tax and the MIAS system is VI. EUROSAI congress was created in Bonn. This review was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the course of a thorough preparation, the relevant courts of auditors had to first familiarise themselves with the legal framework and the VAT management procedures in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Due to the evaluation of this information, we presented the selection of the examination items for the examination planning.</seg>
<seg id="16">The efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (especially the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, to simplify the collection of VAT and to create greater transparency in this area.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our review will not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but will also be the basis for a proposal on an improved system of international exchange of information.</seg>

<seg id="26">(DE) The aim of the examination was to investigate the system of intra-Community sales tax control with a focus on official assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the above regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be highlighted and recommendations on their remedying should be made.</seg>
<seg id="28">VAT information exchange system The examinations were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (“NKÚ”) and the Federal Republic of Germany (“BRH”) of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The focus of cooperation was the review of selected business events between entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the utilisation of information obtained from international assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two states.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the tests was drawn up in the spirit of the European guideline No 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI testing standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The tested period included the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of the results and evaluation of parallel testing</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel review of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the focus on the exchange of information in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of the Council and 1925/2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of taxable persons, tax declarations and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the examination also extended to the legal situation in cross-border passenger transport with bus and coach transport and the comparison of statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">Comparison of VAT administrations in the two states has identified differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for purposes of value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany the entrepreneurs are registered independently of the level of their turnover, the main criterion for registration in the Czech Republic is the exceeding of the sales threshold set in turnover tax law.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, the taxable persons receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, the taxable for the purposes of value added tax will receive a tax number applicable only to domestic sales.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German taxable person wants to make intra-Community sales, he must apply for the granting of a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="42">As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules within the EC should be standardised (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) Cross-border passenger transport with bus and coach.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport with bus and coach buses is tax-free, but there is a entitlement to deduction of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the transport service, insofar as the route leads through Germany, is taxable.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EC level to standardise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Directive 2006/112/ EC of 28 November 2006 on the common sales tax system (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) Tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="48">While the taxable value-added tax declarations must only be made for under-year tax periods (month or quarter) in the Czech Republic, taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly) have a tax obligation in Germany (monthly or quarterly)</seg>
<seg id="49">Revenue tax advance notifications and after the end of the calendar year to issue a value-added tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="50">In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax obligations in Germany must provide sales tax applications electronically.</seg>
<seg id="51">The introduction of the obligation to electronic levy of VAT declarations in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial management (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="52">4) Comprehensive messages.</seg>
<seg id="53">While the taxable persons in the Czech Republic must submit their summary messages in the financial offices (FY), German taxable persons have to submit the summary messages at the CLO2.</seg>
<seg id="54">Accordingly, the FÄs in the Czech Republic are available immediately after their submission to their submission.</seg>
<seg id="55">Deutsche FÄ shall only be available for the data from the summary messages after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="56">Updated information about intra-Community sales is required as promptly as possible to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="57">The monthly presentation of summary messages would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the updating of the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="58">This would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the Member State of the purchaser (see 4.4), but only if all the EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of detailed requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German financial management within the specified period has completed a significantly lower percentage of the requests for information received.</seg>
<seg id="63">Due to these problems, the BRH has recommended constant monitoring of the deadlines to the German CLO (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States is to develop its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The NKÚ and the BRH indicate that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, elements or approaches to an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">Within the framework of cooperation, the two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community sales implemented between Czech and German tax projects.</seg>
<seg id="69">Of these, 31 cases were reviewed together by the use of the CLO's legal possibilities, where there was doubts about the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The courts of auditors were following the following:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the value added tax debt of the relevant taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the taxable persons had either unlawfully benefited from VAT exemption or did not designate the purchase of goods in their VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the FÄs could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because they were incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information has not been used for different legal provisions in the two Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some cases have been uncovered in which taxable persons in their summary reports show sales inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in the MIAS was incorrectly flawed, so that the employees (the FÄ) had to identify in these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Testing procedures</seg>
<seg id="79">Testing procedures in the CR</seg>
<seg id="80">The test was carried out in the period June 2006 to March 2007 by department II – “state household revenue” and the territorial test departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">Tested places were: the Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The College of NKÚ approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Testing procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The examination was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the Audit Area of Transport taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">It was part of the 2006 business plan and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase, the actual test began in the 4th century. Quartal 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination of several federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Taxes from the following law have been included in the examination:</seg>

<seg id="93">The audit results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two courts of auditors</seg>
<seg id="95">In the run-up to the parallel examination, several meetings of representatives of both invoices took place.</seg>
<seg id="96">Participants in these meetings met with the organization of financial management, the legislation on value added tax and the system of VAT management in each other country.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following check-up topics for the parallel tests were determined: 1.</seg>
<seg id="100">Registration of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">Cross-border passenger transportations with bus and coaches – legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>

<seg id="118">An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or an operating facility in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds the amount of 1,000,000 CZK in the last 12 consecutive calendar months, will be paid on the first day of the third month after the month in which he exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., concerning value added tax; following “law No. 235/2004”).</seg>
<seg id="119">The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxable person if it has exceeded the deadline for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or an operating facility in the Czech Republic, which provides sales tax services or services with the right to deduction of VAT, must register for the value added tax even if its turnover does not exceed 1 million CZK, but it fulfils other conditions mentioned in Law No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="122">An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or an operating facility in the Czech Republic, which does not fulfil any of the conditions laid down in the law, may voluntarily request registration for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="123">The registration procedure in accordance with Law No. 337/1992.</seg>
<seg id="124">Anyone who wants to register voluntarily for value added tax must provide the deadline in his request, from which he requests the registration as a value added tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="125">The financial officer has to examine the information transmitted by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed request for registration with all plants.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts about the information he has given, he has to ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="127">If the financial officer has established by checking that the entrepreneur meets the conditions for registration, he has a written information about the registration and allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="128">In the event of the financial officer, the financial officer shall indicate the date of entry into force of the registration tax and the period of delivery for the value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="129">The termination period is the calendar quarter; unless the company's turnover for the previous calendar year reaches the amount of at least 10,000,000 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="130">If this is the case, the event period of the calendar month is.</seg>
<seg id="131">An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least 2,000,000 CZK in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as a period of complaint and to inform the financial officials of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The granting of a tax number in the registration date has always constitutive character.</seg>
<seg id="133">The taxable person has to indicate the tax number in each communication (including payments) with the financial officer, as well as in cases where a special law prescribes this (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax number contains the encoding “CZ” and a basic component in the form of a general identification label.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the case of natural persons, this is the number of birth certificates or other general identification sign, as far as a special law determines this. In the case of legal persons, the general identification sign is the corporate identification number (according to the provisions in § 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation, despite the appropriate request by the financial officer, the local financial official has to register him by office.</seg>
<seg id="137">This will also be given to the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur admitted to a business activity receives a tax number at his first registration for any type of tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">This also applies to registration as a value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="140">In accordance with Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, the financial officer may demand, in the event of non-compliance with the obligation to register VAT, that the taxable person should have been registered as a taxable person by the financial officer until the deadline has been incurred for the period from the date from which the Contractor should have been registered as a taxable person (§ 98 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount so fixed shall be regarded as a tax payment in the sense of § 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the event of the statutory conditions, the registration of a VAT obligation may be deleted for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">deletion of registration at the request of the taxable, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="145">A taxable person may apply for the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Deleting the registration of office because of (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235/2004), if: a) the taxable persons in the period of 12 consecutive months did not perform any performance and did not inform the financial officials of the reasons for this, b) the taxable person's obligations under Law No. 235/2004 did not fulfil, c) the previous taxable person no longer fulfils the conditions for the tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) taxable without legal seating, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and in the Czech Republic neither has their legal seat, registered office nor an operating site or a taxable foreigner who performs in the Czech Republic and shall provide a tax declaration in accordance with § 108 of Law No. 235/2004 for these services or deliveries and to pay taxes (“non-anscent entrepreneur”) shall be taxable with the provision of the service in question.</seg>
<seg id="148">It must submit a request for registration at the FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.</seg>
<seg id="149">It is obliged, in this amendment, to all the US-IdNrs allocated in other Member States or third countries. to specify.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a non-answer entrepreneur is entitled to register later than on the day of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague shall retroactively register 1 retroactively, as it has been subject to sales tax in accordance with Law No. 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the event of a retroactive registration, the FA Prague shall demand 1 of the participants in question ( invoices or written explanations) for proof of performance.</seg>
<seg id="152">If a non-transparent entrepreneur chooses registration in the Czech Republic before the first version of a performance, the FA Prague 1 has to demand the presentation of the performance-based contract documents.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-transparent entrepreneurs were registered at the FA Prague 1, including 124 from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-transparent entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law No. 235/2004, the financial officer shall be authorised to delete the registration of a non-requireable entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following, the calendar year if it does not accept the obligation to provide tax registrations or declarations and tax payment.</seg>
<seg id="155">When examining the NKÚ, it turned out that in the event of a tax declaration by mail with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for the issuing of a tax declaration, this declaration was not received until 31 January at the FA.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deleting the registration, will be known to the FA later as on 31 January, a deletion of the registration of the non-transparent entrepreneur will no longer be possible in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of taxable persons in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In accordance with the provisions of the assignment (§ 137, 138 AO) each business company must be registered with the municipality and/or the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">This registration must be made a month after the start of the business activity.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality passes on the registration to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the relevant financial office finds that a business activity has been included, but has not been logged in, it may also register the taxable person of the office retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">In Germany, taxable persons are obliged, irrespective of whether they are resident or non-anscent, to register for two-childs of value added tax if they comply with the conditions in § 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the level of revenues achieved.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">Special FÄs are responsible for abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible.</seg>
<seg id="167">On April 30, 2004, the German-speaking Czech Entrepreneurs were registered as of 1 March 2006 and 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.</seg>
<seg id="168">According to the findings of the BRH, these FÄs often refused to register so-called bogus self-employed with their residence in the new medium-sized. Eastern European Member States of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the EC accession of these ten states restricts the free movement of workers, these self-employed workers tried to circumvent these restrictions by establishing their own business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These (pice) self-employed do not comply with the preconditions for recognition as entrepreneurs, which are usually dependent on a single client, which are determined by a single client, who determines their working time and the type of execution.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire of the relevant FA and make information on the company and the business activities carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a binding form for all FYs in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It will be processed either in special organisational units within the law or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="174">With the help of this pressure, a risk assessment for the individual taxable person is carried out before the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The construction of tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits are the identification number for the relevant FA, the following three (or four) digits show which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the taxable, the last paragraph is always a control digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries, a USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is allocated by the CLO at the request when the entrepreneur is registered for sales tax purposes in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="179">The USt-IdNr. is automatically assigned by the CLO if the taxable person is declared intra-Community deliveries intra-Community deliveries or in his turnover tax annual declaration intra-Community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="180">The USt-IdNr. is made up of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. At the request (e.g. if it stops the business), but only after the completion of all tax processes (appropriate of all business years) or 2 if the financial administration finds that it does not operate any business.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a rule, the validity of the USt-IdNr. from the validity of the turnover tax number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In these cases, the FÄs must inform the CLO about the deletion of the turnover tax number so that the validity of the USt-IdNr. can be terminated at this time.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to value added tax law (§ 19 (1) UStG) domestic taxable persons must not pay VAT in the following cases: 1st of the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the value added tax has not exceeded the amount of 17.500 € and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of €50,000 in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT for other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they do not have to pay turnover tax, small entrepreneurs are obliged to register in the tax office and to issue an annual revenue tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small businessman can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration is binding on the following five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">It may then invoice VAT and deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-transparent taxable persons can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and refrain from deduction.</seg>
<seg id="192">The fiscal representative fulfils the tax duties of the foreign entrepreneur so that he does not have to register for the purposes of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the invoices, it must be indicated that a fiscal representative has been ordered.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation in the two states varies.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered independently of the level of their turnover, the first prerequisite for registration (next to others) is the exceeding of the threshold specified in the value added tax law.</seg>
<seg id="197">If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but there may be differences due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the event of registration for the value added tax, this tax number shall also apply to intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, an entrepreneur who can register for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for internal German sales.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community sales, he has to pay particular the allocation of a USt-IdNr. apply for.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-stage registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for both national registration to value added tax and intra-Community sales, may lead to significant misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-stage system allows a retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxable person does not register his or her business activities in the community or with the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows for an accurate predisposition to value added tax for previous disposition periods, in particular a precise estimate of the value added tax debt.</seg>
<seg id="206">As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole of the EC should be standardised.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.</seg>
<seg id="208">This is to be assigned to the Federal Central Tax Office of any natural person after birth.</seg>
<seg id="209">This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person takes up a business, the relevant FA requested a commercial tax identification number, which as USt-IdNr. is used.</seg>
<seg id="211">In future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the USt-IdNr. there are.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">Cross-border passenger transportations with bus and coach buses</seg>
<seg id="214">The legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">In accordance with the provisions in § 70 of Law No. 235/2004, the transport of passengers between the various Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a entitlement to deduction of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="216">The exemption from value added tax shall also apply if the transport of persons registered as a taxable person in other Member States or is carried out by foreigners who are taxable inland.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return journey is regarded as a separate transport process.</seg>
<seg id="218">In practice, non-transparent entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any other economic activity than the cross-border passenger transport with bus and coach buses, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as a sales tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="219">The cross-border passenger transport has been exempt from the value added tax obligation in the Czech Republic due to the Law on the Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex No V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The given place says in the text:</seg>
<seg id="220">“For the purposes of the application of Article 28(3) (b) Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic can, according to paragraph 17 in Annex F of the directive, be maintained for cross-border passenger transport either as long as the condition of Article 28(4) of the directive is complied with or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States’.</seg>
<seg id="221">Die gesetzlichen Vorschriften in Deutschland</seg>
<seg id="222">Pursuant to Article 46 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="223">Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the part of the transport service, which is detrimental to the country, is taxable in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">German taxation does not distinguish between local and non-transparent (bus) entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="226">Promote a non-transparent taxable person by Germany, the part of the carriage, which is detrimental to Germany, shall be deemed to be taxable.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before the provision of its services in Germany, the non-transparent entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger services to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="228">This registers it for tax purposes (comparable 4.1.2) and grants a special certificate for any powernibus mentioned in the registration of the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="229">The Contractor shall provide its taxable transport services in a German VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="230">On 1 March 2006, the FA Chemnitz-Süd 741 Czech bus company was registered.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport service is provided for a domestic-based entrepreneur, the non-transparent taxable person must not pay VAT itself to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="232">In its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay the value added tax to the financial office and the invoiced net contribution to the non-transparent taxable persons. This process is referred to as the ‘simplification of the tax debt’ and is in line with Article 196 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the registration by a non-transparent taxable person and his income tax declaration, the German financial management has several means to verify the accuracy of the tax declaration in terms of taxable passenger transport:</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile control groups of customs check the certificates of power bushes authorised abroad, which are used for passenger transport by Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each examination, the mobile control groups pass on an inspection protocol to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can demand the payment of the value added tax from the bus driver before continuing his journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-transparent taxable person may deduct the tax debt given in his turnover tax declaration from the tax debt indicated in his turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the FA has doubts about the correctness of a VAT declaration, it can arrange an examination that has to be settled in the FA, or can use the funds of official assistance mentioned in Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see No. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the foreign taxable person refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may request assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">The BRH considers these funds to be used in tax matters to verify value added tax declaration or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-inclusive bus contractor as to elaborate in relation to the low volume of turnover tax on taxable passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the examination of the books of a non-transparent taxable person causes disproportionately high costs for the taxable person and for the financial management.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter must examine foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of foreign language, but also foreign accounting principles.</seg>
<seg id="243">Accordingly, such an examination is expected to be due to a higher time than a territorial taxable, although the examination is limited to the passenger transportations taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-inhabitable taxable person must not only accept the audit rights of his national financial management, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, the taxable person for each Member State in which only one passenger carriage is carried out must comply with all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of financial administrations of the relevant EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">In this way, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger services leads to disproportionately high administrative burdens.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation varies from one Member State to another.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT on the basis of the EC accession law.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the transport service is subject to sales tax in accordance with the transport route that has been lost in German territory.</seg>
<seg id="251">If a non-transparent taxable person provides such a transport service for the first time, he must register this with the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="252">This registers the taxable person who must declare the taxable share of the service in a tax declaration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">The law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three Czech taxable persons registered at the FA Chemnitz-South have the passenger transport as a business purpose.</seg>
<seg id="255">The tax volume in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="256">The Member States – which charge VAT in accordance with Article 46 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common sales tax system – have an administrative burden on the relevant tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid the disproportionately high costs of predisposition to VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state in which carriage begins or in which the service provider is resident.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such a type of taxation would require a change in Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.</seg>
<seg id="260">Increasing tax declarations</seg>
<seg id="261">Return and processing of VAT declarations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">Insofar as the law determines nothing else, the entrepreneur shall be obliged, even if no tax debt has arisen, to the issuing of a VAT declaration in the form given by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax debt is created at the end of the deadline for the delivery of the VAT declaration. Except for this regulation, the VAT on the import of goods is on the import of goods in accordance with Law No. 235/2004. The maturity of the tax is determined by the customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">As a result, above-average high deductible taxes on a refund claim, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of setting this deduction without having to make a request for this.</seg>
<seg id="265">The deadline will not be applied in cases where the financial officer will initiate a tax procedure in terms of tax debt of the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="266">Pursuant to § 73 (11) of Law No. 235/2004, the claim to deduction of VAT may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax declaration for the last tax period of the calendar year, in which the claim for deduction has arisen.</seg>
<seg id="267">Upon expiration of this period, the deduction may be asserted within three years of the end of the tax period, in which the assertion would have been possible for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this requires the presentation of a complementary change in sales tax.</seg>
<seg id="269">The Novelle of Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows for a supplementary VAT declaration only for the period in which the claim could have been asserted for the first time for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">A taxable person must make a supplementary VAT declaration if: a) the sum of the corrections to an increase in the tax debt, b) shall make corrections which will not change the last known tax debt, but will only change the information so far, c) in accordance with § 49 of Law No. 235/2004 of the VAT rate and the tax debt.</seg>
<seg id="271">A taxable person can make a supplementary tax statement if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax debt.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxable person must make the complementary tax declaration by the end of this month, which follows the month in which the relevant facts have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="273">The turnover tax declaration can be delivered electronically either via the Internet or by data carriers.</seg>
<seg id="274">The delivery via the Internet can be made with a certified electronic signature or without these.</seg>
<seg id="275">If they are without electronic signature, it must be submitted in addition to data carriers.</seg>
<seg id="276">The printing for the value added tax declaration contains separate lines for the indication of the value of intra-Community deliveries and the purchase.</seg>
<seg id="277">The value of related services must be indicated in separate lines of the VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some headings are used for automated primary controls within the framework of the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States at there as a taxable registered persons is compared to the data provided by the Czech taxable persons in their summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="280">The value of the purchase of goods from other Member States from there as taxable persons is compared with the help of the MIAS with the information in the summary messages of the taxable persons from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">In the context of the ATIS system, a credibility test of VAT declarations takes place at the FA.</seg>
<seg id="282">This is done automatically, as the value added tax declaration cannot be processed without the prior examination.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility assessment includes an calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT declarations.</seg>
<seg id="284">In accordance with § 37 (1) of Law No. 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to 2 million CZK against persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations arising from this or a special tax law or a decision in accordance with this law.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system – automated tax information system, which uses the Czech financial offices for technical support for tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="286">In its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄs were rarely used by the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person in question in the event of non-representation.</seg>
<seg id="287">Revenue and processing of VAT declarations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly sales tax applications and the annual value added tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxable persons obliged to provide VAT prior messages must nevertheless make an annual revenue tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must make an annual revenue tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="291">The taxable persons are generally obliged to up to the 10th century. Day after the expiry of the calendar quarter, in which the value added tax is created, a value added tax prior notification (§ 18 (2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, fraud in the previous year more than 6.136 € or is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur for the levy of monthly sales tax applications is at the latest by the 10th of the year. Day after the end of the month in question.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxable person may also opt for the levy of monthly VAT advance notifications if he has reimbursed an amount over 6.136 € in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">If the annual value added tax has no more than 512 €, no value-added tax pre-registrations or VAT declarations shall be issued.</seg>
<seg id="295">A resulting value added tax debt must be paid 10 days after the expiry of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="296">A refund can lead to a more thorough examination of financial management.</seg>
<seg id="297">(Law) deadlines for processing VAT declarations and for reimbursement of value added tax payments do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.</seg>
<seg id="299">In principle, sales tax declarations, including reimbursement cases, are to be dealt with quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German value added tax law allows for an extension of these (determination or payment) lists (§ 18 (6) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">The extension of the deadline must be applied for separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">If it is granted, the issuing of VAT advance messages as well as the corresponding payments may be made a month later. In the case of monthly messages, however, a special advance payment must be made.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment will be charged with the VAT debt detected for the December registration period.</seg>
<seg id="304">If an error is detected, the entrepreneur must make a corrected value-added tax advance.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no “energy” turnover tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="306">If the sales tax declaration to be submitted by 31 May of the following year is issued once in the financial office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect value-added tax prior notification, but only the incorrect annual VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corrections to this VAT declaration on the pre- or disadvantage of the taxable person are possible within four years of the expiry of the year in which the first VAT declaration was issued.</seg>
<seg id="308">After the expiry of this four-year period, a value-added tax declaration can usually only be corrected in cases of an easy-to-use tax reduction or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">The taxable persons must submit the VAT advance notifications electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The FYs can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unpleasant hardening.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual VAT declaration can be submitted in both paper form or Internet with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If the delivery is made without certification, the taxable person must make the declaration in addition to paper and with his personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">If no value added tax pre-registrations or statements are made, the financial management shall be entitled to make a gross estimate of the revenues obtained from the taxable.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the case of late delivery, the taxable person can be placed with a delay surcharge (up to 10% of the tax debt or up to a amount of €25,000).</seg>
<seg id="315">In the case of an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FÄs often did not charge this delay.</seg>
<seg id="316">In the cases where the FÄs levied the delay surcharges, the amount was set inconsistent and arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="317">The delay surcharge therefore fails to reduce the average delay, especially in the case of the annual turnover tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="318">The print of the VAT declaration contains separate lines for the value of the value of intra-Community deliveries or in the event of an intra-Community deliveries. Purchase.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are also separate lines for the reference to services.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable sales must be indicated in a separate line of VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="321">The value added tax declarations submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by personal staff.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data of electronically submitted tax declarations are directly available to the financial management.</seg>
<seg id="323">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="324">After all data is electronically covered, they are subject to a risk management procedure and a false choice is made on the basis of certain standards.</seg>
<seg id="325">The selected value added tax declarations must be checked by the competent employee on the basis of the automatically created test instructions (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although financial management must only make a gross estimate of VAT debt, it has as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, the taxable persons have to submit their VAT declarations 25 days after the expiry of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the sales of the taxable person, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, the taxable persons have to submit their pre-registrations according to the amount of their tax debt of the previous year by 10 days either after the expiry of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="331">The value added tax declaration must be issued by 31 May of the following year at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to provide an annual VAT declaration has a number of advantages and disadvantages:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxable person can correct the errors in the monthly advance notifications by issuing a single VAT declaration;</seg>
<seg id="334">– Reporting its information on intra-Community sales, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;</seg>
<seg id="335">– The federal states of the same MIAS data on intra-Community purchases only then decrease when the value added tax declarations have usually been processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to registration (see 4.1.3) German entrepreneurs must make a value of revenues regardless of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This levy obligation enables the German financial management to review compliance with the sales ceiling for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the relevant FA can compensate for the value added tax declaration with the relevant explanations for direct taxes and the annual accounts of the company concerned.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, financial management can only check the level of turnover on the basis of the income tax declaration given.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German taxable persons are obliged to submit VAT prior notification.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to electronic levy of tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial management.</seg>
<seg id="342">Comprehensive reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Purchase and processing of compound messages in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">In accordance with the provisions in § 102 of Law No. 235/2004, an entrepreneur who provides goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes shall provide appropriate summary messages (hereinafter referred to as “ZM”).</seg>
<seg id="345">The indication of the value of the delivered goods is always carried out in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the USt-IdNr7, the individual taxable, under which they are registered in the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="346">Information on services is not made in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="347">The taxable persons with calendar monthly or quarterly tax period have the ZM at the latest on 25. Day after the expiration of each quarter to be issued at the local competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="348">incorrect data must be corrected in a correction-ZM within 15 days of detection of the error.</seg>
<seg id="349">Flawed data in the ZM will always be replaced by the data from the correction-ZM.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similar to tax declarations, the taxable persons can also elect the ZM electronically.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a taxable person does not issue a ZM or correction-ZM, although he is obliged to do so by law No. 235/2004, the financial officer has to ask him to submit the relevant ZM and assign it to the consequences of non-refunding. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary duties, the financial officer shall be authorised to impose fines up to an amount of 2 million CZK in accordance with § 37 of Law No. 337/1992.</seg>
<seg id="352">In its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄs did not use their power to impose fines on their lower taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="353">Particularly in the case of the delivery of the ZM, the taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their duties, as the omitted levy of a ZM does not affect the level of its value added tax debt.</seg>
<seg id="354">In accordance with § 102 (5) of Law No. 235/2004, the financial officer shall be obliged to verify the information in the ZM or correctionZM, to eliminate all ambiguities and to use the information on the setting of the tax debt.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bei Nichtübereinstimmung</seg>
<seg id="356">8 of the data in the ZM with which the taxable person corrects incorrect information in the ZM by issuing a correction-ZM either from his own initiative or upon request.</seg>
<seg id="357">The financial officer has to correct the data on goods deliveries to other Member States in the ATIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">– the taxable person does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the ZM (or correction-ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction of a correction.</seg>
<seg id="359">– the financial officials have demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxable person in the ZM or correction-ZM.</seg>
<seg id="360">The right-clicked right-handed persons, without a correction-ZM being issued by the taxable person, do not replace the obligation of the taxable person to make a correctionMM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from the ZM will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only the national financial authority mentioned for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT must provide and receive this data.</seg>
<seg id="363">This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is perceived by the Department of International Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The message "O_MCTL" is automatically obtained from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect USt-IdNr, which have been specified in the transmitted ZM lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">Will the incorrect USt-IdNr. in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is placed on the list of false USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="366">The list contains a “money about doubts about USt-IdNr.”.</seg>
<seg id="367">The financial officer checks the data and gives the result of the review to the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the purchase of goods from another Member State, the taxable person shall indicate this in his VAT declaration and shall enter into the value of the purchase in the respective lines of the VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchaser and the values specified by the supplier from the other Member State in its ZM shall be forwarded by the CLO to check the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="370">The workers there must investigate the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="371">Three different situations can then occur:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value given by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT declaration is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by the suppliers from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the financial officer checks the correctness of the information.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The difference is zero.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation may arise either by changing the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrected his ZM) or by changing the information in the value added tax declaration (the Czech taxable person there is a supplementary tax declaration from his own initiative in the meantime).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to verify the correctness of the information in the VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="377">c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, which the Czech taxable person indicated in his turnover tax declaration, is higher than the values of their goods deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="378">This is, in turn, at the discretion of the financial officer to check the correctness of the information.</seg>
<seg id="379">After verifying the differences and clarification of the reasons for their appearance, the financial officer introduces the results of his review in ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">These results are forwarded to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of transactions transmitted by the CLO to verify transactions is available for the individual quarters of 2005 from graphic no. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="382">The above graphic 1 shows that the number of cases transmitted by the CLO to the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">The significant reduction in the number in the 4th century. Quarterly in 2005, the Czech CLO is based on the threshold for a False Election, taking into account the minimum limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">Differences between the information in the value added tax declarations and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error of domestic purchases.</seg>
<seg id="385">There can also be a mistake in the taxable person in another Member State or a mistake caused by the fact that certain types of supplies in the ZM are indicated differently in the individual EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions are evident from table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Draft and processing of compound messages in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries to other EC Member States from Germany or participate in triangular transactions must pay quarterly ZM in which intra-Community deliveries are listed after purchasers (§ 18a (1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The ZM must be on 10th at the latest. Day of the month following the calendar quarters in question.</seg>
<seg id="390">If a long-term extension is granted for the issuing of VAT applications, it shall also apply to the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="391">The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">The electronic delivery has been mandatory since 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="393">The competent FA can allow exceptions for individual taxable persons in order to avoid unpleasant hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">If the taxable person determines that the ZM was defective, it is obliged to submit a correction-ZM within a month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In the case of non-representation of the ZM, the CLO introduces an enforceing procedure.</seg>
<seg id="396">This includes the following steps: – first memory – second memory, combined with the threat that a forced money will be set and – setting the forced money.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German tax order allows the setting of a forced fee of up to 25,000 € (§ 329 AO), the CLO is set in three stages of forced money amounting to 125, 250 and 500 €.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxable person acts illegally if he or she does not give a ZM in full or lightly, not in full or in time or if he does not correct a ZM or not in time.</seg>
<seg id="399">This infringement can be punished with a fine of up to €5,000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ in the MIAS because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="401">The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="402">The data from the summary messages are only available after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing ZM are regulated in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).</seg>
<seg id="405">In the case of incorrect USt-IdNr. In the ZM German tax obligation, the German CLO receives a message “O_MCTL” from the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">As a result, the CLO addresses entrepreneurs and calls on the right data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO does not succeed in obtaining the right information, the case will be made to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to us to ask the right information.</seg>
<seg id="409">In the course of his examination, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs were the USt-IdNr. at the request of the CLO corrected.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the memory and the threat and setting up to three consecutive forcedders require too much time when a taxable person may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">The cases, which have ultimately been reported to the competent FÄ, have usually been completed within one to two mona-ten.</seg>
<seg id="412">The relevant FA refused tax exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.</seg>
<seg id="413">Legte of the taxable person the right USt-IdNr. The FA called on him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data itself.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the handing over of the corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="415">That is why the taxable persons of the request often did not comply. As the CLO does not have access to the data of the value added tax declarations, no comparison of the information about goods deliveries with the relevant information in the ZM before this data is forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This balance can only be done by the FÄ. This is usually done in the preparation of a VAT special examination.</seg>
<seg id="417">Incoming data is processed from other Member States at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Unreal USt-IdNr. are recognised and reported to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data will be used for the control of the purchase of employment in the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="420">As soon as they are available in the system, they are similar to the CLO with the data previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If you fill in certain criteria (see 5.2), control messages will be created and transmitted to the relevant FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="422">This happens continuously, whereas a list of the working data of all value added taxable persons will be created later and will be forwarded to the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="423">The risk management system (RMS) for the verification procedure then resembles these data with those to intra-Community recruitment.</seg>
<seg id="424">The system checks completely (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered in another Member State for value added tax shall be issued within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter a ZM to the local competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="427">The FÄ process the ZM and pass the data on to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of the intra-Community deliveries reported by the taxable persons in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same taxable persons in their turnover tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the balance are taken into account within the framework of the tax setting.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to pay quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Since 1 January 2007, the taxable persons have to submit the ZM electronically at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="432">The data from the ZM are only available to the CLO after its processing.</seg>
<seg id="433">In the Czech Republic as well as in Germany, the taxable persons in the ZM only offer goods deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="434">The provision of services is not indicated in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄs, the German FÄs cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the ZM given.</seg>
<seg id="435">Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect US-IdNr. even then not corrected when the taxable person is the right USt-IdNr. the FA informed the FA.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German financial management resembles the information on intra-Community deliveries that make German taxable in their turnover tax applications, not with the information provided by the relevant ZM.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between pre-registration and ZM data are not regularly uncovered before the German CLO directs the MIAS data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Due to these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="439">The data transmitted by other Member States to the delivery of goods to Czech taxable persons will be compared to the data on the purchase of goods in the Czech Republic, which the Czech taxable persons indicated in their VAT declarations.</seg>
<seg id="440">The Czech CLO takes off the balance for each calendar quarter separately.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech financial administration, German financial management is not generally examining the taxation of intra-Community purchases.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such general control will only be carried out in the case of taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community purchases of other taxable persons if the RMS creates a test reference or the taxable person has already been selected for an examination.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the fÄ from the clarification of the reasons for occurring differences.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current system of ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the financial authorities with information that can be half a year old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay could be reduced to up to four months if the taxable persons had to hand over monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly delivery would only increase the bureaucratic burden insignificantly, as most taxable persons in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to pay for monthly turnover tax declarations or pre-registrations and for the ZM no longer any information is required than for sales tax declarations or pre-registrations.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid red tape, ZM's levy could be linked to the delivery of VAT declarations or pre-registrations.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, a duty for the monthly delivery of ZM would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those to intra-Community recruitment and increase the flow of data between the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the Federal Government moved the general introduction of monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="454">The implementation failed to the concerns of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">This feared that a monthly redirection of MIAS data could lead to the CLO of other Member States to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In order for the obligation to pay the monthly ZM effect, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly updating of the MIAS data is possible.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic in external trade.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total rates of the intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany are presented in table No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both courts of auditors demanded data to the number of false tax numbers or US-IdNr. in the O_MCTL messages exchanged for the individual quarters between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data can be found in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">They have significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for the differences can be a different basis for calculation for the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers to the numbers to the calendar quart, for which the ZM was handed over, the German CLO refers to its numbers on the calendar quart, in which O_MCTLMeldung entered.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information on level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information about intra-Community sales and the taxable persons who have carried out them from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="468">Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 by the Council on the assistance in the field of VAT, which repealed the directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of the Council), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request is carried out by a request for information.: request for information RFI) using the standardized SCAC print.</seg>
<seg id="470">The financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their answers to a received RFI by the financial management to the CLO. This concerns the translation of the information provided in the standardised SCAC pressure into the foreign language and the forwarding to the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the answers to sent requests. It is concerned about their translation into Czech and its distribution to the relevant FE.</seg>
<seg id="472">Art. 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RFIs exchanged in the verified period between the Czech Republic and Germany were tested by the NKÚ.</seg>
<seg id="474">From the total number of 94 of the RFI received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in other 23 cases (i.e. 24,5%) this processing period was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the remaining one case, no response was sent to Germany until the NKÚ was tested. More detailed information on the deadlines, within the request made by Germany by the Czech Republic, can be found in the graphic 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">In 136 cases (i.e. 40,6%) a response within the three-month period (i.e. 53.4%) was processed and in 19 cases was e.g. The test by the NKÚ did not receive an answer from Germany (in the remaining one case was not detected due to the stated information when Germany answered the request for information).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information about the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany have been answered can be found in Graphik No. 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of the values indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany intra-Community sales are presented in Graphik No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The above graph shows that the sales tested in connection with requests for information usually had values of more than €60,000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="481">The financial officials of other Member States are often transmitted to information without prior request, which are important for setting VAT debt.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic all information is collected at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The exchange of information between the individual Member States is carried out electronically.</seg>
<seg id="484">“Automatic exchange” in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of the Council means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to other Member States in regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="485">“structured automatic exchange” means the systematic transmission previously defined information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information refers to the financial officer from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to § 19 of Law No. 235/2004 as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">In the processing of this form, the financial officer shall be entitled to the required data in the relevant document template and shall pass it directly on to the relevant employee of the financial management, where these data are collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. After that, these data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified deadline, namely at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Czech Republic also transmits information to the other Member States on sales in mail order, which are tax-free in the country of origin, intra-Community- chen business transactions that appear inadmissible and to potential “missing traders”.</seg>
<seg id="490">This information will be forwarded to the other Member States by means of an SCAC print in spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information from the local competent FA is based.</seg>
<seg id="493">The FÄ sends the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCACVordrucks to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The FÄs are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in English, even the SCACVord printing used is a single-chig.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German information request tested by the BRH has been transmitted to ensure the tax on employment in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community delivery from Germany to the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum limit of €15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no reasonable justification for the question, the German CLO refuses to provide information on a turnover below the minimum limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO is concerned about the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC print [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in German or in English.</seg>
<seg id="499">In response to the request for information, the CLO directs this to the relevant FA and refers to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">No further deadlines are set at the various levels of German financial management.</seg>
<seg id="501">The German CLO has the technical means to monitor the maintenance of the Fristein, but not through the necessary personnel capacities to remind the FÄ of the answer to the unfinished requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The FÄ will receive the necessary information by lettering the taxable or conducting an external audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">The external auditors usually choose between two forms of examination: the value added tax special audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months or the so-called value added tax show, which may apply. only relates to a recent process.</seg>
<seg id="504">In this short and flexible form of testing, an announcement against the taxable person is not necessary and it has proved its worth in investigating a single turnover.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the event of automatic exchange of information, Germany will provide the other Member State with the following information: – via USt-IdNr., which have been allocated to companies based in other EC Member States – through the reimbursement of pre-tax to entrepreneurs resident in other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has committed itself to providing the other Member States with the following information within the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., b. distance selling (transmission trading) to other EC Member States, which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. significant deviations between the recruitment reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of objects subject to tax obligations in Germany, e. potential “Missing Traders”, which have made intra-Community sales, regardless of whether their UStIdNr. or has already been deleted, as well as taxable, intra-Community deliveries to potential “Missing Trader” or to customers who have made a USt-IdNr. We have used it abusive.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">The dispatch of requests for information or spontaneous information is carried out both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local competent law, which transmits the appropriate SCACVord prints to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACVord prints (Czech-English) and provides information in the English or German language, the German FÄs of the statement, requests for information or spontaneous information on a single-language form can only be deducted in German.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ stated that the Czech financial management carried out 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were carried out by the German financial management only in 40,6% of cases within this period.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO points to the three-month period, it does not monitor compliance with it.</seg>
<seg id="514">Due to the absence of memories, a large proportion of requests for information requested are available.</seg>
<seg id="515">That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous alarming process to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has now changed.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminiscent of the financial offices of the outstanding requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">Umsatzsteuer-Risikomanagement</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at various levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the field of value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department of Methodology and Economic Administration of Sales Taxation or its Department of Risk Management deals with the observation of potential risk models for tax revenue and evaluates trends in these risks in national and intra-Community trade.</seg>
<seg id="523">At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion of the “creditworthiness of value added tax declarations” and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasion within the framework of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates risky goods, prepares risk management in the field of value added tax conceptually and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department of International Assistance in the field of VAT provides, among other things, the exchange of information, acts in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system, provides public relations and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 of the Council.</seg>

<seg id="529">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="530">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="531">The methodology of tax testing and tax control, among other things, carries out risk analyses within the framework of methodological control of tax audits, sets out priorities for the order of business of financial directorates in the selection of the cases to be examined, creates risk analyses to combat tax evasion and collect information from the financial management and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Taxation centres exist in the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for taxable and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for non-registered taxable persons (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="533">Special audit units were set up in 12 selected cases.</seg>
<seg id="534">These have a regional competence and carry out tax checks on the basis of the corresponding authorisation outside the local area of competence.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up the special audit units emerged from the increase in new and “better” forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.</seg>
<seg id="536">These special units are examining according to the needs of the control centres or concentrating on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and taxable persons with particularly high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the field of value added tax have been integrated into the ATIS system: – the task of the “creditworthiness of value added tax declarations” for the assessment of the risk of risk of tax returns made – the task of “selection of the taxable persons to be tested”, whereby the taxable persons to be examined are selected by certain criteria – the task of “MIAS”, which allows financial officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The task “MIAS” allows, among other things, the following: – review of the validity of the USt-IdNr. from taxable persons from other Member States – confirmation of the value of goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as indicated in the ZM of all suppliers of the taxable person in question from other Member States – creation of a list of taxable persons who have not issued a ZM – formal control of the data, the taxable in the Czech Republic in their ZM before this information is transmitted to other Member States – creation of a list of taxable persons, in whose VAT declarations the information on goods delivered to other Member States does not match the information in the ZM – the creation of a list of taxable persons in whose value added tax declarations the value of the goods purchased from other Member States is not in line with the information in the ZM of all its suppliers from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">In the context of its perception of the fight against tax evasion, financial officials have access to the data in the case of public authorities such as trade register, land register, motor vehicle registers, trade register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 of the Purchasing and Processing of Comprehensive Notices in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk Management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to its federal construction, both the Federal Financial Authorities (especially the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of a RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="543">There are common working groups for the development, but neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states fully have a uniform database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the CLO, the STI 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as the “CUSS” – Coordination Centre for Revenue Controls and Tax Measurement Measures) collects the test findings on fraud in the OPUS database.</seg>
<seg id="545">In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up at the KUSS. There, the financial offices can enter the names of discovered Missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="546">The KUSS coordinates combined cases of value added tax fraud at national level as well as cases of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experience of the KUSS will be brought into the development of the RMS through its cooperation in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved in this.</seg>
<seg id="549">The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. other Member States that appear in the ZM of German taxable will be held at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal review is carried out before the transmission of the ZM to other Member States to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus also its benefits (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The validity of the validity in the ZM of the U.S.t-IdNr. takes place on the basis of the O_MCTL condenses transmitted by the other Member States (for the correction of the correction of invalid USt-IdNr, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of communications for the discovery of alleged Missing Traders. As evidence, certain characteristics are used, which usually occur in carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="553">The Federal Government's PARTs are dependent on the processing of these communications and have the result of their investigations in certain cases to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="554">The BRH’s test has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to close a case of tax fraud with sufficient probability (instead of concentrating mainly on a company’s turnover).</seg>
<seg id="555">Accordingly, the BRH has recommended the BMF to work in the creation of communications with combinations of different clues.</seg>
<seg id="556">The risk management system should also take into account other indications, e.g. the payment of the taxable person, the industry or the participation of the company.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of risk management is the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT applications and the annual declarations.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the system creates a list of the taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their turnover tax registration or annual declaration.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO for monitoring the complete delivery of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchase of the data in the MIAS is compared to the data in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="561">The financial administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of quarterly data, as they would result in too many disagreements due to other factors as tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">– Supplier and purchases are based on different times for the execution of intra-Community sales;</seg>
<seg id="563">– different accounting collection and tax declaration of Skonti and discounts.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to the comparison of the data from the value added tax declarations with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in VAT declarations and certain other indications (e.g. company text, age of holders/participants, employees and payment methods of the taxable person).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of specialists to combat tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as “Risikomanager”) to program their own rules in such a way that alleged tax fraudsters are filtered out.</seg>
<seg id="566">This system is used in the processing of turnover applications by the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="567">This will provide the relevant FA with the information of the RMS before the value added tax is set.</seg>
<seg id="568">As this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers must adapt the rules in accordance with the feedback from the law.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neuronal network based on the data detected rear cases.</seg>
<seg id="570">Due to this data, the RMS is capable of learning the characteristics for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The system creates a list of tax cases monthly in which there are evidence of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list, the competent FÄs decide on the examination of the taxable persons in question.</seg>
<seg id="573">After examining, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests it proposes.</seg>
<seg id="574">In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neuronal network is used in combination with a rule-based Fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on many data from processed revenue controller declarations and some other indications, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called Datamining system) is calculated, as is likely to be a taxable in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">Then it creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">Due to this list, the FÄ selects the relevant taxable persons for examination and report the exam results to the data center in question.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of these three RMSs is under way in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="579">As each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems will be effective.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will cease when they are actually used.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">It is true that in this report it is not possible to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech and Germany, but the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS has its special strengths and weaknesses in every European state.</seg>
<seg id="584">At present, there is an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">The value added tax – in particular the carousel fraud – has proved to be no national but European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">The people involved in fraud are coordinating their actions not only in one Member State but in several Member States.</seg>
<seg id="587">A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches to an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this is not done, fraudsters are looking for the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="589">The tax losses caused by Europe-wide fraud in value added tax do not necessarily concern the Member State in which the initiator is resident.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any other Member State involved in fraud may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected results from the examination of individual sales within the framework of the parallel tests investigated the quality and recyclability of information on selected deliveries or the valueability of information on selected deliveries or in the context of the parallel tests.</seg>
<seg id="593">Purchase that was the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two Rech-Choards jointly examined the settlement of several deliveries, which there were doubts about their implementation, or which declared the taxable persons of both states in the tax declarations or ZM differently.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight business transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, the NKÚ examined in 43 cases the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, the Czech taxable in their tax declarations and ZM due to communications from the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="598">The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases revealed, among other things, that the different procedures of registration in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1.</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004 acquired a German taxable goods worth 60.500 €.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech taxable person declared a purchase of only 29.869 €, the Czech financial administration set up a request for information to Germany for verification of the value of the delivered goods.</seg>
<seg id="603">The German page was in charge of the Czech information request, the German taxable person in question at his Czech business partner in the 2nd edition. Quartal 2004 goods worth 27.381 €, in the third quarter of goods worth 31.997 € and delivered in the fourth quarter of 10.276 €.</seg>
<seg id="604">Weiter ergab sich aus der Antwort, dass die USt-IdNr. The German taxable person was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted another request from the German taxable person and the validity of the USt-IdNr. retroactively brought forward to 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German taxable person corrected the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="606">This information was a (initially) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="607">By asking the relevant financial office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxable person had issued supplementary revenue tax declarations for the individual (understanding) tax periods in 2004 in which he declared a higher value of the purchaser from other Member States and, at the same time, coveted the withdrawal of pre-tax from the purchase from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the competent employee of the Czech financial office has not been able to determine clearly whether the value of the deliveries of the o.g. German suppliers were included.</seg>
<seg id="609">In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as a sales tax obligation in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">In the event of registration, he had not applied for the allocation of a USt-IdNr, but only a tax number applicable to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is usually not possible in Germany, a taxable retroactively a USt-IdNr. In 2006 the competent employee of the German financial administration retroactively became the competent employee of the German financial management.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO shares a USt-IdNr. retroactively when the clear entrepreneur did not cause delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO the delay after the application of the taxable person to grant a USt-IdNr. caused.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO grants the USt-IdNr. retroactive because the entrepreneur according to § 6 UStG for an intra-Community delivery no valid USt-IdNr. needs.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) US-IdNr. its supplier to declare intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted the USt-IdNr. in this particular case retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">Within the framework of the international exchange of information, the Czech financial official asked for the review of the sales tax registration of the German entrepreneur.</seg>
<seg id="618">The MIAS data results in the day of registration of 5 March 2005, while in a registration certificate issued by the local German FA, 1 October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">The German authorities shared in their reply, the German taxable person was registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons it was only on 16 February 2005 in Germany that a USt-IdNr. is allocated.</seg>
<seg id="620">By requesting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ learned that the financial officer had carried out a value added tax for the tax period from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005 in the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="621">In this examination, the financial office stated that the Czech taxable person had declared services worth 9.897 CZK in his turnover tax declaration, which he made to the German taxable persons before the transfer tax registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">The (Czech) Financial Office set a tax debt of 1,880 CZK compared to the Czech taxable person for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="623">Due to the question of the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxable person the USt-IdNr. was only allocated when he joined the FA on 16 February 2005 in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the FA retroactively registered the FA retroactively from 1 October 200415 for the purposes of value added tax in order to be able to monitor the issuing of VAT declaration for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this turnover tax declaration, the taxable intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic in the value of 160 € (approx. 5,000 CZKs.</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In its turnover tax declaration for September 2004 as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable goods deliveries worth 114.615 CZK to a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="627">In the event of verification of the registration of the German taxable person in the MIAS system, the Czech financial officer stated that this registration was valid only from 11 November 2004 and thus to the goods deliveries to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech taxable subject issued a complementary VAT declaration in which he declared sales of domestic deliveries worth 114.615 CZK and VAT in the amount of 21.777 CZK, which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">By asking the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxable person subsequently submitted a request for the resumption of the tax procedure in terms of supplementary value added tax. As evidence, he received a confirmation of the German financial administration that the German taxable person had been registered since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Accordingly, the Czech financial officer checked the validity of the registration of the German taxable person within the framework of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">From the German information, it emerged that the German taxable person was only on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of goods, a USt-IdNr. has been allocated.</seg>
<seg id="632">As a result, the Czech financial officer rejected the request for the resumption of the tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place, because the German taxable person only was a USt-IdNr on 11 November 2004. He had received.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German receiver declined both the acquisition as intra-Community acquisition and the value added tax and also called for the reimbursement of pre-taxes at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="635">Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax debt of the German taxable person, the German financial officer did not report the information in the VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="636">In addition, the BRH found that the company of the German taxable person mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the response in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German taxable person also confused the Czech financial officials.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial officer checked the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxable person from a German taxable person worth €2.686.</seg>
<seg id="640">By means of a request at the local competent tax officials in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ stated that the Czech financial officer had investigated the Czech taxable person in the context of an external examination as to whether the intra-grown delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxable person had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech taxable person declared the internal acquisition not in his turnover tax declaration, because the German supplier does not in the invoice his USt-IdNr. but only its tax number for business within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person will only be registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community sales from 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech financial officer also asked for the German financial management to send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxable person so that he can do so. could initiate an appropriate tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech FA looked at this business as the acquisition of goods from an entrepreneurial (private person in Germany and therefore did not set VAT for the purchase of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH found that, according to German law, a taxable person who supplies goods to other Member States does not have USt-IdNr. for intra-Community deliveries must be able to use the VAT exemption for such a delivery.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier only has to use the UStIdNr. The purchaser in the other Member State may be able to prove the transport of the goods in question in the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="647">In this case, sales according to German tax law are a (tax-free) intra-Community delivery that should be subject to employment taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this business incident because the delivery of a machine was not part of the core business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Section 4.6.2 the German CLO disclaims requests for information on intra-Community sales if they are below the minimum limit of €15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004 acquired a German taxable goods worth €2.561.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech financial officer took a test of this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">Within the framework of the intergovernmental state aid, the Czech financial management requested the examination of these goods delivery by means of an SCAC pressure.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech taxable person said that he did not receive the goods, has never stood in business relationship with the German company and the purchase of the goods in question has not been booked.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German financial management rejected the request for the transmission of evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, because sales were below 15,000 € and no other explanatory statement had been given.</seg>
<seg id="655">As the Czech financial officer did not receive documents for a subsequent tax on the acquired goods, the tax audit remained resultsless, and the original tax setting was valid.</seg>
<seg id="656">In the US, for example, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have agreed to reduce their interest rates to zero, while the US Treasury and the Treasury have agreed to reduce their interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="657">The German taxable person declared these deliveries in his VAT declaration and in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to tax exemption has been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="659">Due to the communication by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">In Section 4.6.1 it was shown that the replies of the German financial management to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than the answers of the Czech financial management:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. In its examination, the NKÚ stated that the Czech financial management on 5 October 2005 would receive a request for information about the value of the 4th edition. Quartal 2004 erfolgten Wa-renlieferungen an Deutschland übermittelt hatte.</seg>
<seg id="662">In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable in the value of 86.307 €, but the Czech taxable person declared in his turnover tax declaration for the same period in his turnover tax declaration only the purchase of goods worth 35.314 €.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the answer to the request for information, which the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the in Art. 8 of the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of the Council, the German side announced that the request for information could not be processed, as the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Because the German financial management did not comply with the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, a Czech financial officer asked for a German taxable person worth €1,265.554 by means of an SCAC pressure to verify one in the third and fourth quarter of 2004, with indications for carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The NKÚ found that, at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.</seg>
<seg id="667">By requesting a local financial officer, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxable person in his turnover tax declaration had not declared the delivery of new vehicles to these German taxable persons worth 11.816.103 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech financial officer reported the information in the tax declaration and the Czech taxable subject gave a corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="669">Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not continue this request for information to the local FA responsible.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following the communication by the BRH, a sales tax special examination was carried out in the German purchaser in Germany. It was noted that the acquisition of all motor vehicles in question had been properly taxed and that the vehicles were sold to other taxable in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxable person acquired in the 4th century. Quartal 2004 by a German taxable person a car worth €48.500.</seg>
<seg id="672">However, the Czech taxable person declared no intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="673">By requesting the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxable person had no value-added tax declaration since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Czech taxable person did not make tax statements even upon request by the financial officer. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA fixed sales tax debt for the period October to December 2004 with zero.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the aforementioned delivery of the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="676">As the Czech taxable person did not work together with the financial officer, this request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany was made.</seg>
<seg id="677">As the answer to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the NKÚ review, in which way the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="678">Due to non-compliance with the obligations arising from Czech VAT law, the tax registration of the Czech taxable person with effect from 23 August 2005 was deleted.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial response was sent, because at the time of the review of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external audit:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech financial official asked for a German taxable in the third quarter of 2004 by means of an SCAC pressure to verify a German taxable in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In his reply to the request for information, the German financial officer indicated that he would only be in charge of the invoices issued by the Czech Steu- obligation on deliveries worth € 16.335.</seg>
<seg id="683">Due to the question of the NKÚ, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA was not yet completed at the purchaser in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German purchaser declares the acquisition of goods worth € 16.335 twice in its VAT advance notifications for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, a Czech financial officer asked for a German taxable in the value of € 198.167 by means of an SCAC pressure to verify the delivery of motor vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, with signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German financial management transmitted a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxable person had acquired several motor vehicles and that, incidentally, the investigation was not yet completed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="687">The NKÚ found that the local competent FA had carried out several external checks in the Czech taxable person in order to check above-average high taxes.</seg>
<seg id="688">However, an unjustified claim has not been established.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH stated that the German taxable person for the period in question had declared the acquisition of goods from other Member States in the overall value of 579.114 €, and that the examination of the German FA was not yet completed at the purchaser in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="690">In Section 4.4.1 the reasons for disagreements between the declaration intra-Community purchases in the recipient's VAT declaration and the data in the supplier's ZM are described.</seg>
<seg id="691">In the case of audited cases, periodic inconsistencies or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to the data from MIAS, the Czech taxable person in the first quarter of 2005 acquired goods worth 35.716 € from the German taxable person, but the Czech taxable person declared this acquisition not.</seg>
<seg id="694">As the Czech taxable person did not work with the financial officer and did not take business at the legal seat of the company, the Czech financial officer asked for review in the context of the international exchange of information, as the German taxable person had communicated with the Czech authorities.</seg>
<seg id="695">The German response to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German financial management of the Czech taxable person, was unknown at the address given and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarding agent.</seg>
<seg id="696">The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxable person only delivered goods worth 21.659 €.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech tax obligation sent a wrong payment confirmation to the German taxable person about the amount of 155.153 € in favor of the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="698">After detecting the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech purchaser, the German taxable person, with the support of his other Czech customers, succeeded in recovering the delivered material with the exception of a part of €7.916.</seg>
<seg id="699">With a request at the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ stated that the financial management was subsequently included in the amount of 388.522 CZK in the amount of 388.522 CZK due to the information received against the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="700">Due to a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable in the value of 7.916 € in the value of 7.916 €.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to German legislation, the German taxable person declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="702">His ZM contained the following information concerning Czech taxable persons:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial management requested the review of a delivery of goods as well as the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to the request for information, the Czech taxable person in the period in question was delivered to the German taxable goods in the overall value of 396.126 € and provided services worth 11.885 €.</seg>
<seg id="706">The NKÚ found that the Czech financial management had carried out an examination in the Czech taxable person to investigate this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the request for information, the Czech financial management participated in the German taxable subject and assembled a production plant.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech taxable person provided the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was mounted on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German taxable person did not accept the mounted production plant and made defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person calculated the production plant for 107,100 € and 11.885 € for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German taxable person received the Rech, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">By requesting the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ stated that all invoices had been properly booked in the books of the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="713">The value added tax declarations for the third quarter of 2005 only included the amounts documented by the Czech taxable, and invoiced invoices based on the first May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH found that the local competent FA came to the conclusion of the Czech financial management's response to the conclusion of these revenues, which is a uniform (Waren) delivery of the Czech taxable person to the German, including the assembly carried out.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of performance of these so-called delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German service receiver of the delivery of the plant owes the value added tax in accordance with the German VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient can assert a deduction in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As the turnover of the German taxable person remained unchanged, the German FA did not charge a correction of revenues.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxable A acquired a machine worth 58,000 € from the German taxable C. in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech financial officials set up a request for review of this information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the request for information, the German page, the German taxable C, announced this machine in 2004 to the Czech taxable B, which, however, returned it to the German taxable C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the German financial management, the machine was not returned to Germany, but transported to the establishment of the German taxable C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">The answer to the request for information continued to ensure that the German taxable C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxable A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">This took the machine at the seat of the branch of the German taxable person in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">As this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no domestic-social delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">By requesting the relevant financial officials responsible for the taxable B, the NKÚ stated that, according to the MIAS data, the German taxable C was delivered to the Czech taxable goods (a different machine) in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">The taxable B declared that he did not receive this goods so that the local Czech financial officer addressed a request for information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">The answer to this was that the machine was delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">In the course of further investigation into the taxable B, financial officials found that the machine was not booked at the age of 88.027 € at the taxable B and that it could be the same type of machine as the German taxable C was delivered to the Czech taxable A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The NKÚ continued to note that the Czech financial official responsible for the taxable A was carried out by a local Czech financial officer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The financial officer had the invoice of the German taxable C from 7 February 2005, in which the taxable A is to be indicated as the recipient of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech financial officer found that the taxable A did not ban this bill.</seg>
<seg id="733">The taxable A had completed a leasing contract with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same kind.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also concerned transport.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the answer to the request for information for the setting of the tax debt of the taxable A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH found that the German taxable C did not deliver the machine worth 88.027 € to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxable D.</seg>
<seg id="737">Accordingly, no intra-Community delivery of goods was present, but a taxable delivery within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">Consequently, the German financial officer recognized the claim of the German tax-painted C to value added tax exemption and reported the information in its tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German taxable D delivered the machine to the Czech taxable B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">The BRH continued to note that the German taxable C was given the delivery of a machine worth 58,000 € to the Czech taxable A in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not checked at the tax audit carried out by the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following picture represents the contractual relations between the business partners involved in the aforementioned transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">In the event of an information request, the NKÚ stated that the Czech financial management had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005 in which a German financial officer was entitled to review intra-Community deliveries of a German taxable person value of 879.680.625 € to a Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="746">The German financial officer indicated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictional intra-Community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The German taxable person has not had active business activities since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had made an external audit in the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="749">The head of the Czech company said that this is probably a claim from the German taxable person to the German financial management, which the Czech taxable person used to assert as a shareholder in the German company at the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech financial officer has not yet informed the fact that the German financial management is working on the case with reference to the Czech taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="751">The information available is that it has not been a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxable person in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for these inconsistencies was the refractive indication of intra-Community acquisition in the tax declarations of the recipients (see. Section 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to the MIAS data, a German taxable person in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005 provided a Czech taxable goods in the total value of 33.205 €.</seg>
<seg id="754">However, the Czech taxable person did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech financial officer asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In its response to this request for information, the German page, the German taxable person has sent a part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxable person, and the other goods have collected this personally.</seg>
<seg id="757">By requesting the local Czech Fi-nanzbeamten, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxable subject had issued a supplementary tax declaration for the period in question before receipt of an answer to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="758">Nevertheless, the differences in the value of the purchase were not clarified, so the Czech financial officer recommended a tax check at Czech taxable.</seg>
<seg id="759">This review has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to the MIAS data, a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004 was delivered to a Czech taxable goods worth 46.854 €.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, a Czech taxable person declared intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only 14.856 €.</seg>
<seg id="762">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for review of the actual value of delivery.</seg>
<seg id="763">The German response to this request has been submitted to three invoices, which expelled a total value of the delivered goods from 31.999 €, i.e. an amount equivalent to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxable person and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="764">By requesting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ stated that it was sent to the account holder of the Czech taxable person after receipt of the reply from Germany and had remained with it in such a way that, after verification of the invoices, it wanted to talk to the company owner about the issuing of a supplementary VAT declaration for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">Until now, no additional VAT declaration has been made.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech financial officer participated in the NKÚ, he will proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT setting for the tax period in question were respected.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxable goods delivered to the German taxable goods worth €1,600.</seg>
<seg id="769">In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German financial officer asked for verification whether the aforementioned Czech taxable persons actually had, as the alleged capital owner of the German taxable person had founded a number of sham companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">In the course of the review of the procedure by the FA, the Czech taxable person confirmed the purchase of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech taxable person, however, the goods were not delivered by Germany to the Czech Republic, but sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech taxable person presented evidence for sale in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech taxable person was not registered in Germany as a transfer tax and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech financial officials sent this information in his response to the request for information to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="775">By requesting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxable person had issued a complementary tax declaration for the fourth quarter of 2004 due to a tax check, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German taxable person and, at the same time, claimed the right of deduction for the purchase from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">In his Czech VAT declaration, he did not register VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="777">As a result of a complementary value-added tax declaration issued after the external testing, the Czech financial officer established the value added tax debt unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to the Czech legislation, a purchase of goods from other Member States was not available in this case, as the goods were not sent or transported to the Czech Republic by another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="779">Thus, the Czech financial officer has brought a wrong conclusion at the external check.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH found that the German financial officer corrected the tax declaration of the German taxable person and demanded the payment of value added tax worth 1,600 €.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent FA sent a control communication to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, entrepreneurs stated intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech financial officer received a request for information from the German financial management on the question of whether the Czech taxable person in February 2005 acquired a car worth €47.400 in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The request for information was annexed to a printout of the turnover tax registration of the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="786">As a further facility, a photocopy of the passport of the person was attached to the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="787">In the course of his investigations, the Czech financial officer found that the pass was stolen that the person mentioned in it had not introduced a vehicle into the Czech Republic and angled, she had no contacts with a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="788">The value added tax registration certificate, whose pressure had been sent from the German side, was not issued by the Czech financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="789">With this information, the Czech financial officer answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="790">By requesting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxable person does not have his seat on the address indicated in the Commercial Register and that the company's Managing Director is not achievable.</seg>
<seg id="791">After a tax booth procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech financial officer set the tax debt of the Czech taxable person with zero.</seg>
<seg id="792">In the course of another investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it due to an Internet advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="793">The BRH found that the local German financial officer had rejected the claim of the German taxable person to exempt this delivery from the value added tax on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the turnover tax declaration and the reported values from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="795">A Czech taxable taxer should delivered goods worth 89.424 € to a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">As the purchase declared by the German taxable person did not coincide with the MIAS data, the German financial officer requested the review of deliveries and their payment within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In his response to the request for information, the Czech financial officer, the only Managing Director of the Czech company, was deleted in the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and a new Managing Director has not yet been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was allegedly a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech taxable person gave a VAT declaration and a ZM signed after the deletion of the managing director in the Commercial Register of a person not authorised to do so, namely this shareholder of the company.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech taxable person participated in the financial officer, the capital owner has paid the payment for the payment received in euros to the account of the company.</seg>
<seg id="801">The staff were very friendly and helpful.</seg>
<seg id="802">By requesting the local Czech FA, the NKÚ stated that the financial officer recognised the right of the Czech taxable person to apply VAT for goods deliveries to other Member States worth 1.326.307 CZK in the first quarter of 2004 and from 1.416.180 CZK in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the German financial officer did not report the value added tax declaration of the German purchaser, as a German court had the insolvency of the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="804">As the former external audit did not provide signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to levy a fixed value added tax debt.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to the MIAS data, a German taxable person acquired € 4.251.196 in 2005 from the Czech Republic, according to which he had acquired goods worth 43.274 € in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">The German taxable person declared the intra-Community acquisition neither in the 2004 VAT declaration nor in the year 2005.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, he did not say a value-added starting point.</seg>
<seg id="808">Due to this disagreement, the German FA presented a request for information on the 4. Quartal 2005 and the 1. Quartal 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community product deliveries in the overall value of 167.246.083 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the request for information entered into which the German site asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxable person had actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In the answer to this request for information, the Czech financial management stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representatives).</seg>
<seg id="812">The documents provided to the NKÚ by the relevant financial officer show that, together with the Managing Director of the Czech taxable person on 30 March 2006, a protocol on the start of sales revenue is carried out for the 4. A quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the taxable person was asked by the financial officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but this shall be subject to this.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the trade register, the term of office of the only managing director expired on 16 May 2005, without a new Managing Director being appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech taxable person has not had any tax statements.</seg>
<seg id="816">Within the framework of the parallel examination, the NKÚ examined several cases intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two courts of auditors exchanged information about the cases tested on both countries' CLO.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, taught the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to make taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">As a result of this information, the company was registered from June 2005 but received no German USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (UCR) accepted an order for a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and for their delivery to Austria, on the basis of the risk and for the invoice of the Danish customer.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to insufficient own production capacities, the Danish company continued to share part of the order to a German taxable taxable (UDE) based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following picture represents the contractual relations and the transport route of wind turbines:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to German legal situation, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:</seg>
<seg id="824">– The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines on its behalf, on its risk and on its own invoice for assembly to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Due to the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of wind turbines is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– Because the forwarding agent has been commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter has made transport in its own name, at its own risk and for its own invoice, is the place of delivery of the German sub-author (UDE) where transport has begun, i.e. in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind turbines have been delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered in an EC Member State (CR) as taxable, no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-author (UDE) as the EC Member State, for which the delivery was intended, is another than the registered state of the Czech company19.</seg>
<seg id="828">Accordingly, the e-se delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) asserts the deduction of VAT in its turnover tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) is also aimed at the place where transport has begun.</seg>
<seg id="830">However, some of the wind turbines of transport from the Czech Republic and others from Germany have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="831">– The delivery of the wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">The delivery of the remaining wind turbines produced in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria as well as intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) has not declared in its German tax declarations or in its ZM intra-Community deliveries given to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The NKÚ found that (UCR) has not reported intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community purchases in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion in this case.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH case circuits in order to show the size of the differences caused by the different laws of 2004 between the information on VAT declarations and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="839">The tested cases also show that it takes some time for the taxable persons and the law to apply the new legislation:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In his ZM for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable goods delivered goods in the overall value of 792.977.452 CZK to a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="841">In the same period, another Czech taxable person in his ZM reported intra-Community deliveries to another German taxable person in the overall value of 18.157.265 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="842">The information transmitted by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that, in both cases, electricity supplies were electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech taxable persons took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in accordance with the Czech Law No. 235/2004 in their ZM in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">In the event of further examination of these business transactions, the NKÚ audit group stated that in 2004 different statutory provisions on the delivery or purchase of electrical energy were applied between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic the taxable persons are the deliveries of electrical energy in accordance with the corresponding moods of the law in 2004. In 235/2004 as an intra-Community product deliveries, it was not a intra-Community acquisition of goods, but taxable and taxable sales in Germany after the German legal provisions applicable in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="846">The differences in the statutory provisions have been eliminated in the Czech Republic by adopting Law No. 635/2004 which, with effect from 1 January 2005, amended some tax provisions.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. When examining intra-Community deliveries or purchases in cooperation with the BRH, it was further noted that a Czech taxable person in his ZM for the first and fourth quarter of 2005 declared intra-Community deliveries to a German taxable in the overall value of 240.411.163 CZK and another Czech taxable person in his ZM for the same period intra-Community deliveries to another German taxable in the value of 263.470.776 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="848">Information transmitted from the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases it was a matter of deliveries of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">In accordance with the wording of the Law No. 235/2004 applicable from 1 January 2005, the place of performance of the person in which the purchaser shall have its legal seat, registered office or business, shall be the place of performance for which this delivery takes place.</seg>
<seg id="850">That is why the Czech taxable persons should not have allowed electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both taxable persons treated the delivery of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community deliveries led to a significant difference of 503.881.939 CZK in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="852">Final remarks</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both courts of auditors won deepened knowledge of the systems of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">Cooperation laid down differences in the two systems and in the statutory provisions applicable to VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel tests, interesting cases came to light intra-Community deliveries or purchases.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them are worth observing.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the results of the audit, both invoices were made recommendations on the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up to these recommendations in the form of a control test should be part of the further observation.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both courts of auditors are the basis for the successful implementation of future tests in the field of VAT management.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement of construction services and corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on its parallel tests</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The awarding of services by public clients is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state has the task of using public funds as economically and economically as possible and ensuring fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU) the awarding of services by public entities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to be able to guarantee a largely unrestricted competition across borders, the public clients have to comply with EU requirements in their contracts from certain limits (Switzerland values).</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, EU Member States must transfer and apply the EU's procurement rights in national law.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already happened in the Czech Republic as well as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Below the EU thresholds, it is up to the individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The awarding of services is also a pioneering area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Due to the fundamentally high potential for damage, public clients must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and inadmissible benefits when awarding their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel tests on the EU-wide award of construction services as well as on the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="14">The focus of the tests was on the application of the EU's energy law implemented in national regulations and the prevention of corruption in the awarding of construction services in the construction and road construction or transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">The surrender below the EU thresholds has also been included in the consideration of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit results of both courts of auditors are summarised in the present joint report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report is also intended to address international institutions – such as e.g. B. to the International Organisation of the Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI) − focuses.</seg>
<seg id="18">The audit areas and tested bodies The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the topics listed are mainly based on cross-sectional tests, which he carried out in the years 2011/2012 in the construction administrations responsible for the road and the construction of the Federal Government in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">He examined e.g. The construction of motorways as well as large high-rise projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors attracted results from previous investigations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic was based on its evaluations from the years 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction measures in road construction, in the rail sector, in the water construction, in the high-rise building (sick houses, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc. ) as well as other other areas of construction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the awarding of public contracts of the Federal Government is mainly due to the construction administrations of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, state construction management is centrally responsible for awarding the transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">Im Hochbau werden die Vergaben dezentral von denjenigen Stellen durchgeführt, die staatliche Haushaltsmittel einsetzen.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, there are also freelance activities for sub-areas of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast to the evaluations, differences in the procurement law and in the market structure for construction services of both countries must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="27">Establishment of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the national area, procurement procedures limited to this are regulated by budgetary law and the administrative rules on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="30">Many complementary individual arrangements are also laid down for both EU-wide and national contracts by internal regulations;</seg>
<seg id="31">, such as the so-called “mountain manuals” of the Federal Government, in which the statutory requirements are supplemented or elaborated in accordance with the public jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, the awarding process applies exclusively to the procurement law and the other statutory provisions applicable to the area above and below the EU threshold values.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2012, the procurement law was significantly novellated.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new regulation reinforces transparency in the handling of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited opportunities for corruption in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Grundzüge des Vergaberechts in beiden Ländern</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, the open procedure, which does not apply open procedures and the negotiation procedure, is, in particular, the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold value must be applied to national remedies (public tendering, limited tendering, free-standing awarding), but which are largely in line with the aforementioned EU-wide remedies.</seg>
<seg id="38">The public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (in the case of EU-wide contracts) and the public invitation to tender (at national contracts).</seg>
<seg id="39">Every interested company can make an offer in the open procedure and in the public tender.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another important feature of the German procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="41">To this end, the division of an overall construction of trees into technical and partial pastries is primarily used.</seg>
<seg id="42">The individual awarding of this loose aims to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both aforementioned features of the German procurement law are proven instruments to achieve economic results.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees operate in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures must also be applied under the construction projects below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">One exception here is the simplified procedure in which less stringent procedures may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech procurement law contains provisions in accordance with EU law that contracts should be concluded when competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current statutory provisions in the Czech Republic leave the choice between the open and non-open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Czech Republic there are over 85,000 construction companies, of which 1,900 companies with 20 and more employees are available.</seg>
<seg id="50">Construction volume of public clients and shares of the remedies in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In Germany, the entire volume of construction was EUR 307 billion in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="52">This accounted for EUR 45.5 billion in public construction (15%), which, in addition to the federal construction, includes the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The construction volume of the Federal Government in the high construction and long-distance road construction (without rail construction and water construction) included EUR 8.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="54">The volume of orders for construction and long-distance road construction of the Federal Government has been distributed to the remedies in 2011 as follows: 80,7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% not open procedures and limited invitations to tender and 6.6% negotiation procedures and free-trade contracts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide contracts.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 4.7 billion in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, the volume was EUR 7.8 billion, which was 37% of total volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Encryption after remedies for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14,3% not public proceedings 9.5% negotiation procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for order volumes under the threshold 2.7% other proceedings</seg>
<seg id="59">The data refer to all public contracts for deliveries, services and construction services awarded by public funds in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The o.a. Data can be seen that the parallel tests of both countries are aimed at an important part of public procurement, which has a major financial prevention in all contracts, and the open procedure and public tendering in the award of contracts have a prominent role to play in the awarding of contracts and the public tendering.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the results of parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel tests on the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">In this context, the working groups of both courts of auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel tests, which they carried out in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">They essentially set out:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU directives on the awarding of construction services by public clients have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nrn. 1 and 3.1</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the EU requirements, the prevention of corruption also serves the procurement regulations of both countries, which are partly different in their priorities and their detention (No. 3.2).</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, there is a significant requirement for the subcontracting documents that they must all contain the information needed for an appropriate bid creation.</seg>
<seg id="68">The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not have preconditions.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Germany, the award documents have largely met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to adequately determine the object of order.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, construction services are to be divided into Lose in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of the BRH, this prescription was largely implemented in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">In its tests, the NKÚ found, particularly in the area of road construction, that the awarding of large-scale services without loose or very large loose could affect competition and lead to a restriction on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Improving the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">According to the provisions of both countries, the remedies under certain conditions can, in principle, arrange additional or modified services with the companies already commissioned, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (Nr. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective requirements for determining the award were mainly followed in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, the remuneration points can freely choose between open and non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In Germany, on the other hand, the priority of the open procedure for EU-wide contracts or public tendering, which corresponds to the open procedure in the case of national contracts, applies.</seg>
<seg id="79">This allows more companies to make offers.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the construction projects, whose estimated total order values reached or exceeded the EU threshold value, the tested construction administrations were given the construction services in principle throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct treasure of the expected order value is an essential basis for the choice of the right award.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, cost-sharing banks are being used for cost investigations in public buildings, especially in high-growth</seg>
<seg id="84">the construction projects completed on the evaluations are based.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the area of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">In the case of construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to set up at an early stage to the planned data.</seg>
<seg id="87">The tested construction administrations were usually opposed to this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or a lack of controls may affect competition (No. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of applicants for participation in non-commercial procurement procedures is particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="90">According to EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, must not be discriminated against and must be announced beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to the EU's requirements, the remuneration offices in both countries are to switch as often as possible from the companies to be asked in the selection of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="93">In order to meet the risk of manipulation, there are some very detailed guidelines in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="94">The tested administrations did not allow these requirements to be taken into account in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of applicants were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, it is in the interests of a chanc-friendly competition to ensure that companies interested in supply are given the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">A contact between these companies with each other and with freelance workers involved in the creation of the performance description must be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The relevant regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the tested construction administrations in Germany did not hold these requirements in some cases (No. 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In the opening up of offers, the additional principle and the principle of transparency must be taken into account in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="101">The requirements for labelling, documentation, custody and secrecy of the offers are intended to give manipulation margins and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tests in both countries gave rise to only a few complaints (No. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Testing and valuation of the offers are determined in both countries by requirements for the construction and execution organization.</seg>
<seg id="104">The regulations in Germany are comprehensive, but have not been fully respected by the certified remedies.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, remedies handed over offers for examination to third parties without checking the offers beforehand and to adequately document striking problems.</seg>
<seg id="106">The offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">At the end of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition are to be informed about the intended order before placing the contract.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="109">The Czech Republic provides for a judicial review also for non-European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in a few cases the remuneration offices held the prescribed deadlines on the orders of the order divisions or differ from the offer of the bidders (No. 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible in the tested construction administrations in both countries.</seg>

<seg id="117">In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the allocation coordination and the remedies directive to be transposed into national law by the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general principles of the European Union are, in particular, the competitive environment, the equal treatment offer or the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="119">In order to enforce these objectives, the award coordination directive contains special rules for the EU-wide construction services for construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="120">To this end, their expected order summs must reach a level of EUR 5,000,000 at present or exceed.</seg>
<seg id="121">The regulations concern, in particular, the content of the procurement documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the admission of deadlines, including for the receipt of the offers, the documentation of the procurement procedure, the requirements that can be submitted to the qualifications of the applicants and the remedies directive forms the basis for the legal protection of applicants and bidders.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of possible infringements of the procurement law, companies affected can check the decisions of the public clients in verification procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union's guidelines into national law.</seg>
<seg id="124">Korruptionsvorbeugung</seg>
<seg id="125">Bedeutung der Korruptionsvorbeugung</seg>
<seg id="126">In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption means the abuse of a position of trust for private advantage,</seg>
<seg id="128">the i.d.R. by the beneficiaries of these decisions.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and lead to significant economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of global economic performance.</seg>
<seg id="131">In the area of the European Union, the scope of these costs is estimated at 1%.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of public clients, competitive agreements or unfair behaviour can call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">The prevention of corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public entities.</seg>
<seg id="134">They have to review the construction and process organisation of their administrations at particularly risky areas in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption.</seg>
<seg id="135">By means of preventive measures and effective controls, the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse can be considerably restricted.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of public services is generally regarded as a particularly corrupt area of work.</seg>
<seg id="137">Maßnahmen zur Korruptionsvorbeugung</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption – especially bribery and bribery, as well as advantageous acceptance and approval – is prosecuted by criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="139">In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has adopted a directive and recommendations on the corruption12 in the Federal Government. Afterwards, in addition to the risk analysis, the following basic rates must be observed in addition to the risk analysis: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eye principle and transparency, basic separation of planning, awarding and settlement, precise and complete documentation of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, further pre-accession requirements have been incorporated into the public regulations.</seg>
<seg id="141">For example, the competent Federal Ministry for Daily in the field of federal roads introduced an electronically supported control system in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="142">with the remedy data – e.g. For example, the estimated costs and the order sums – as well as information on the freelance professionals involved, and are evaluated on the grounds of insurgents.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted in terms of criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="144">The statutory bids of transparency and equal treatment for bidders as well as the prohibition of any discrimination form the most important bases of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">For public procurement, the Czech Government has established anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper for the fight against corruption for the years 2011 to 2012, and updated for 2013 to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of the measures recommended in it have already been set at national procurement law and appropriate administrative rules.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation essentially contains the following rules: reducing the thresholds for smaller contracts, a duty to prior notice of the surrender by the remuneration, including the cancellation of the reasons for tendering, prohibition of the restriction of the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus the abolition of the possibility of selecting the bid by means of payment, introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Test results on the individual phases of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Publishing documents must contain all information that the bidders need for an appropriate bid creation.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the subcontracting documents must allow a correct calculation.</seg>
<seg id="152">The bidders must not be entrusted with risks that cannot be calculated for them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The award documents consist, in particular, of the performance description and the contractual conditions.</seg>
<seg id="154">In addition, they contain the requirements for detecting the qualification (protection) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are crucial to the selection of the most economical offer.</seg>
<seg id="155">EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="156">The requirements of EU law to award documents are aimed, in particular, at the technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="157">These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="158">The performance description must be in principle product-neutral.</seg>
<seg id="159">Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the performance description is only permissible under close conditions.</seg>
<seg id="160">Avoiding competitive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition, unclear or incorrect information must be avoided in the award documents, as they open room for speculation in the creation of the offers as well as for manipulation of their value.</seg>
<seg id="162">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="163">The same or similar rules in both countries are transposed into national law by EU law requirements on technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="164">The services are generally product-neutral without a factory specifications.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the performance descriptions, the individual services must usually be detailed in the event of performance units with respective quantities of quantities.</seg>
<seg id="166">The prices on the basis of performance units are to be agreed (e.g. Euro per m2 or per piece.</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.</seg>
<seg id="168">The performance descriptions must be completely and unequivocal in any case.</seg>
<seg id="169">You have to contain precise quantities and may not include services that do not determine whether they are needed.</seg>
<seg id="170">remuneration for lump sums or after time costs must be avoided as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indeterminate presets in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The performance descriptions must enable the bidders to be able to create their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The tender should only be made known when the award documents have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="175">There is no obligation to tender for construction services in solvents in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="176">If, according to the type of service to be commissioned, it is possible to divide the public remuneration services into several lose.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, construction services are fundamentally divided into Lose, separated according to the quantity (teillose) and/or in accordance with type or subject.</seg>
<seg id="178">In this way, medium-sized companies are to be able to participate in the competition, extend the number of possible providers and make price agreements more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is considered to be the most economical in the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id="180">Value criteria must be given in the Czech Republic, both in EU-wide and national procedures in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="181">This is intended to be fully and finally recognizable to the applicants according to which criteria are to be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the indication of value criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required in the case of EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="183">In the case of national procurement procedures, the criteria for valuation must only be maintained in an internal procurement notice.</seg>
<seg id="184">The subcontracting documents created by the requested freelance workforce may not contain any references to these offices or planned planners or experts in Germany at the high construction and some road construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is intended to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other inadmissible competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client via the contact with these freelance professionals.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why freelance documents are not allowed to suffocate, nor can there be any planning documents for insight.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contact persons of the companies are solely the client.</seg>
<seg id="188">There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additional or modified services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (after entries), are almost always due to large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="190">In both countries, the statutory provisions allow for a certain extent the awarding of contracts to the already commissioned company, without a procurement procedure being carried out with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="191">According to the EU requirements and the German provisions, the remuneration of supplementary services must not exceed half of the main order.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a closer limit of 20% applies to an appropriate award without public notice.</seg>
<seg id="194">This may, however, increase. the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to participate an additional contractor in the already ongoing construction work.</seg>
<seg id="195">If the company already commissioned is transferred to supplementary services, an arbitrary increase in prices for these services is not in principle due to the Contractor's regulations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="196">On the contrary, the agreed prices and the basics of the price assessment of the order already granted must be extended by the agreed prices and the foundations of the price determination.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to supplementary performance, it may also be possible to reduce the range of services.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, minors cannot be charged with additional supplementary services.</seg>

<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, the performance descriptions contained references to national technical authorisations or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">Some performance descriptions also included product-related requirements – for example for graffite protection, joints or noise protection plates – without this being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, performance requirements have been described so precisely that only one product has been eligible.</seg>
<seg id="205">Nach Teilleistungen untergliederte Leistungsverzeichnisse</seg>
<seg id="206">The BRH has not found any infringements of the bid in any of the tested procedures, in principle to be attributed to services in a list of services subdivided to partial services.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completion of performance descriptions</seg>
<seg id="208">In the vast majority of procedures, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the invitations to tender.</seg>
<seg id="209">Some procedures had to be corrected during the offer phase, as some of the positions or deadlines had changed.</seg>
<seg id="210">The service directories contained positions in which it was not established whether they were required.</seg>
<seg id="211">A list of services for demolition works even consisted almost half of such requirements.</seg>
<seg id="212">Lose and Assessment criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In the case of many contracts, the prescribed explanatory statement was lacking as to why the services, which were largely advertised by experts, were not further divided into Teillose.</seg>
<seg id="214">There have been no complaints when specifying the criteria to be laid down in the value of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="215">Information on freelance activities</seg>
<seg id="216">A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelance professionals involved.</seg>
<seg id="217">Their names were partly on the cover leaves or in an attached plans or opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the remuneration even explicitly called for the applicants to contact the architect “to questions of tender”.</seg>
<seg id="219">In particular, in the high-building area, the remedies of the remedies have mainly led back to the omissions of the freelance work carried out with the creation of the performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="220">The construction services pointed to the lack of capacities to adequately control performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="221">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral tender for public procurement for the construction of a residential house with 12 units of residence have been given a supplier as well as a certain product brand in the performance description.</seg>
<seg id="223">The remuneration did not allow the use of comparable products without justify this.</seg>
<seg id="224">In the case of the establishment of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also presented in the invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="225">Power descriptions with power units</seg>
<seg id="226">In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the scope and type of services required in the performance descriptions have not been clearly identified.</seg>
<seg id="227">As a performance units, they only increased the cultivated space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completion of performance descriptions</seg>
<seg id="229">In the construction of a motorway turnover, the performance descriptions were changed four times in the context of an unopen procedure for the period August to September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">as the performance of the service had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.</seg>
<seg id="231">Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate local information, inadequate construction tests and incomplete design drawings, which had to be entrusted with additional services.</seg>
<seg id="232">When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior contained no requirements for product quality.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors built overtaxed and inappropriate high-quality equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lose und Eignungskriterien</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures in Teillose or the allocation of partial contracts is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="236">A review of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that, in the event of a loose allocation of selected parts, savings would have been possible up to EUR 31.6 million in total costs of EUR 620.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, six different buildings, which were the subject of a single order, could have saved 2.5 million euros (25%) in a loose allocation.</seg>
<seg id="238">In the event of a loose allocation of the construction of 20 bridges, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the awarding of construction services in road construction, the central remedies were subject to very extensive reference requirements as a designation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the construction of a part of a motorway, the remuneration from the bidders in an open procedure, among other things, required the proof of at least three road construction projects carried out in the value of EUR 28 million from the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers fulfilled these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public awarding of another part of a motorway included six separate construction projects in which the remuneration was set out as a recruitment criterion for companies for an annual volume of at least EUR 480 million in the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two-thirds of the funds spent in 2008 and 2009 on road construction projects (i.e. EUR 2.5 billion of a total of EUR 3.7 billion) accounted for a total of five companies that carry out orders alone or as a working group.</seg>
<seg id="244">In the case of 46 procurement procedures with an order range of EUR 528 million, only two or even a bidder issued an offer.</seg>
<seg id="245">The NKÚ pointed out that a reduction in the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Additional services</seg>
<seg id="247">In the construction of a motorway turnover, the remedy of additional services in two cases did not apply any of the statutory procedures and did not close any written contracts on the additional services.</seg>
<seg id="248">Due to unclear quantities and quality requirements, orders were made in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (netto) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (netto), which increased the respective order volume by 21% or 91%.</seg>
<seg id="249">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="250">In several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, even though their need for awarding was already known.</seg>
<seg id="251">Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the 20% of the original order value laid down in the national procurement law, the remuneration with the commissioned companies carried out negotiation procedures without notice.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the construction of a large court building, the remuneration reserves the right to award additional services in negotiation procedures without tendering.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction period, the remuneration extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than the comparable services provided by the same company.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other observations</seg>
<seg id="256">Due to a sampling test of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane highway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to an evaluation of long-term data of the Federal Ministry of the Federal State, the average cost of a four-lane motorwayilometer is up to 10.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison indicates that the motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Comprehensive observations</seg>
<seg id="260">The basic rules on awarding documents largely coincide in both countries and take account of the EU concerns.</seg>
<seg id="261">They serve both a comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the performance descriptions is intended to enable the bidders to calculate the appropriate calculation and create their offers.</seg>
<seg id="263">to protect the client from additional services to be agreed afterwards and also to curb speculative margins.</seg>
<seg id="264">The common basic requirements for the procurement documents are supplemented in Germany by regulations to further reduce competition restrictions and manipulation possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="265">In the Czech Republic, there are no targets for this, for which transparency is increased by publishing the value criteria in the non-European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="266">The requirements for the performance description have been largely met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, deviations had to be criticised, which could also have led to restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The bid in Germany for the formation of cans promotes competition and leads to economic results.</seg>
<seg id="269">In the Czech Republic, according to the test findings of the NKÚ, the awarding of extensive services without lots or with very large loose can lead to restrictions on the supplier's field on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="270">The extensive reference requirements set out in the Czech Republic in road construction have led to public contracts being awarded only to a narrow circle of providers and for smaller and medium-sized enterprises not to be able to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="271">A limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">In the awarding and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to the EU requirements, as well as the German provisions, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main order may be granted under certain conditions without the procurement procedures with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a closer limit of 20% applies to the additional services in the negotiation process without notice to the original contractor.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="277">as the scope of services is often inadequately determined in public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the exceedance is greater than 20%, the additional services with public notice must be advertised.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing up services in Lose, restrictions on competition and resulting adverse effects can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Fixed the award and consideration of the EU threshold value</seg>
<seg id="281">By setting the award, the client determines the scope of the number of companies participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">It can largely leave the circle of possible applicants and bidders, for example through the choice of an open procedure, unrestricted or limited by the prescription not public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of construction projects where one of the EU's fixed threshold is reached or exceeded, there are Europe-wide procurement procedures to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="284">EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">In the election of the award, the public entity must take into account, in particular, the law on European law on competition and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total order value of the construction services of a project in or above the EU threshold value is currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services must be awarded in principle throughout Europe according to open or not open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competition dialogue are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="288">In the event of construction projects that reach the EU threshold or exceed, the public client may deviate from the principle of Europe-wide awarding and assign construction services in national awarding contracts, provided that the estimated order value of the respective lot is under 1,000,000 euros and the sum of this loose does not exceed 20% of the estimated total order value of all construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="289">A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without mandatory reason or deliberately valued at low cost levels in order to evade the obligation to provide the fundamentally Europe-wide allocation of construction services.</seg>
<seg id="290">As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the election of the award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="291">The in-depth explanatory statement of the selected type of award and the examination for the application of the EU's eco-regulations are important components of the documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Equal or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have transposed EU law requirements into national law on procurement procedures and in the threshold.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has also transferred the basic equality contained in the EUR directive more open and not open procedures to its contracts, which are not subject to the EU concerns.</seg>
<seg id="297">There is freedom of choice between the open and non-existent procedure without the decision being taken or justified by the decision. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible according to certain legally defined conditions.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure, or – in the case of national contracts, the public invitation to tender, has a fundamental priority. This is laid down by the budgetary and procurement law and by the guidelines for the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other remedies – as well as the non-open procedure or the limited tender − are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finalised in the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">The existence of an exception must be comprehensible and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tendering is to guarantee as unlimited competition as possible, exclude manipulation opportunities by laying down certain bidders and make possible price agreements more difficult among the bidders.</seg>
<seg id="302">The principle of public tendering is a central element of the prevention of corruption in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct treasure of the expected order value is an essential basis for the choice of the right award.</seg>
<seg id="304">The construction services in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations in determining the expected costs in the field of public construction.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases are based on evaluations of finished construction projects. The databases include cost limits for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such cost limits, the expected order value of a planned prehistoric or to be assigned can be determined.</seg>
<seg id="307">In Germany, the cost databases for road construction have only some construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, a nationwide introduction to all road construction administrations is envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="309">Compensation in the Czech Republic may not resort to central databases or average price investigations in the investigation of the expected costs of construction services.</seg>
<seg id="310">On the contrary, the cost of costs is based on the estimates of the financial body, or the amount of money made available to the building service centre.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures to standardise cost investigation procedures are still in the infancy.</seg>
<seg id="312">The relevant ministries were commissioned to draw up a database for standardised building materials and substances within the framework of the fight against corruption for 2011.</seg>
<seg id="313">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="314">In this database, information on material costs and construction and expansion plants as well as other cost-relevant data is to be collected in order to enable cost transfers and regulations of unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a collection of data for construction projects for better cost control.</seg>
<seg id="316">which should serve as a comparative measure at the price setting in the financing plan and is currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="317">BRH’s essential audit results</seg>
<seg id="318">Election of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited remedies are largely written in the open process or in public tendering and thus followed the budgetary and public requirements.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the Federal Government's construction services were publicly or in the open process.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">In the case of the election, there was no mention of in-depth explanatory statement, why the remedies had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the case of a cross-sectional examination, the BRH established on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures that the non-commercial authorities in relation to the open procedures and public invitations to tender have significant disadvantages in competition and the risk of manipulation and corruption increase.</seg>
<seg id="324">In the construction of public invitations to tender, more than twice as many offers were submitted as in the case of limited invitations to tender and almost three times as many offers as in the case of free-trade contracts.</seg>
<seg id="325">The investigation also showed that the offer prices for limited invitations to tender and free-trade contracts were on average by 6% or 10% higher than with public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallele investigations by the Federal Ministry of Germany as well as a national invoice company confirmed the cost-effectiveness differences between public and non-commercial remedies.</seg>
<seg id="327">As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of the Federal Government even came to twice as high differences between public and non-commercial procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Consideration of EU threshold value</seg>
<seg id="329">The audited remedies provided, as a rule, award plans in the construction projects for which they had calculated a expected total order amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, in which they laid down the services to be awarded to EU-wide and the construction services to be awarded by national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, it has always been a share of more than 80% of the EU's construction services.</seg>
<seg id="331">A circumvention of the commitment to EU-wide contracts by low-cost cost estimates has not been clear.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, it was partly due to faulty calculations to the de facto lowering of the minimum share of the EU procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="333">During the construction of the building, some remedies inadmissibly changed the provisions of their procurement plans.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes and did not say that the minimum share of EU procurement procedures was continued to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">In most of the tree measures tested, the share of EU-wide contracts was usually lower than that of the awarding plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">In some cases, the remuneration offices in the case of the EU's threshold value have been violated against the preset, all 1,000,000 euros and more comprehensive single-cells in EU-wide procedures.</seg>
<seg id="337">and instead chose national procedures.</seg>

<seg id="340">For several large construction measures, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects within the framework of a large sporting event and housing projects, the remedies of construction services in several parts, although these services were equal or comparable.</seg>
<seg id="341">Through these divisions, the individual services were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="342">Calculation methods for the estimated order value</seg>
<seg id="343">In road construction, the price databases that exist for this area were an inadequate instrument for determining the expected order values.</seg>
<seg id="344">The data was based on precisely completed construction projects, but there were indications of the lack of cost-effectiveness, unnecessary additional performance costs or excessive profits of the commissioned companies.</seg>
<seg id="345">In the case of three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% below the expected order values determined by the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increases indices in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the high construction, the expected order values based on the repos architects were based on the costs incurred or on the estimates of investors.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual order values differ greatly from the estimated values.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, but eight contracts led to an increase in costs by 2.1 million euros or 27% in the course of construction execution.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, the actual order value in the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, offer prices exceeded the estimated and increased during the construction of the building.</seg>
<seg id="352">In the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by EUR 16 million or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, the cost of 139% increased disproportionately, as the surface of the farm had only increased by 12%.</seg>
<seg id="353">Comprehensive observations</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have transposed EU rules to lay down the award and to take account of the EU threshold in national law. That is why the relevant regulations are largely in line with the rules.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the priority given to the open procedure or public tendering in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to the non-commercial procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in the public procedures or public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="357">Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="358">The risk of corruption will be considerably improved by not limiting the applicant's field by means of a more rigorous provisions of the client and making price agreements between the bidders more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="359">The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the primacy of the open process or the public tendering in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="360">According to Czech legislation, the remuneration orders can be awarded in open or not open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="361">According to the latest changes in the procurement law, the number of bidders in case of previous participation competition must no longer be limited.</seg>
<seg id="362">This is now very similar to the open procedure for the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the remedies have largely followed the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been divided inadmissible to deal with the requirements for the choice of the type of award.</seg>
<seg id="364">In the light of the EU threshold value, errors had to be found in Germany that led to the lowering of the minimum share of the EU-wide advertised services.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to be able to determine the expected costs of building services and construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">The construction administrations should apply. by means of further controls ensure that the requirements for the choice of the type of award and the scope of services to be paid for throughout the EU are complied with or the prerequisites for applicable cost investigations are created.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preinformation and announcement</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of construction projects with the construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder has already been informed of the planned data in the run-up to the tender.</seg>
<seg id="369">Pre-information and announcements form an important basis for a Europe-wide competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">The preliminary information is intended to include the essential public information on the planned construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total order value reaches the EU threshold value or exceeds and in which the client wants to shorten the supply periods more openly or not open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">In announcements, the client has to provide further details on the planned construction orders to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>

<seg id="376">In the description of the order object, the common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes) unified throughout Europe is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="377">Pre-information and announcements are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the client.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to prevent a disadvantage of foreign interested parties, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and will only be issued after submitting the notice of the notice to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="386">Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a prior information be dispensed with.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, no preliminary information is required in the case of non-European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national procurement procedures, public invitations to tender and participation competitions are not subject to limited invitations to tender on the Internet portal of the Federal Government and, if applicable, by the Federal Government. also to publish in newspapers or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of limited invitations to tender without participation competition, announcements are required from the services to be assigned from 25,000 euros (ex-ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">In the preliminary information, all planned loose of the construction projects can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is particularly important in Germany due to the smallness of the arduous construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="392">In the Czech Republic, this regulation is only a small extent, as it divides much less construction services into Lose.</seg>

<seg id="397">In some open procedures, however, they shortened supply periods, although the deadline for 52 days, which was necessary between the cancellations of the pre-information and the announcements, had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">Other shortened procedures have only been advertised after the twelve-month period of validity of previous information has already expired and before it has been extended.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many published preliminary information, information was missing on the planned distribution of the construction services in Lose.</seg>
<seg id="400">Announcements</seg>

<seg id="405">This published the news on its own paid awarding platform.</seg>

<seg id="413">In the construction of a motorway ring, the remuneration was not elaborated in the notification or in the documentation of the procurement procedure, according to which they evaluate the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants they wanted to allow for competition.</seg>
<seg id="414">The remuneration came to the conclusion in her assessment that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but concluded the candidate with the worst evaluations.</seg>

<seg id="418">Comprehensive observations</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage education system with prior information and announcement is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement in Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector:</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of applicants in non-commercial remedies</seg>
<seg id="422">In contrast to public procurement procedures, the non-commercial procurement procedures cannot participate in the competition in the competition of the services to be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="423">In the case of non-commercial procurement procedures, the remuneration has to make a selection in advance which companies are to be asked to bid.</seg>
<seg id="424">requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow the number of applicants to be limited to EU-wide non- public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="425">In the case of non-open procedures, however, at least five companies are to be asked to bid.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the case of negotiation procedures with designation names, at least three companies can be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of companies to be asked is a process within the procurement procedure, which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. by unilaterally giving preference to certain companies.</seg>
<seg id="430">In addition, the restriction of competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both cases, the result of the contract may be considerably affected to the detriment of the client.</seg>
<seg id="432">The remedies must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process of progress.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Equal or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="435">The rules on the selection of applicants are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the EU requirements, the remuneration offices are to change as often as possible under the companies to be asked in the selection of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="437">Furthermore, competition must not be limited to companies based in certain regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The remedies have to justify the selection of applicants and document the expiry of the selection process in their awarding rooms.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, in the case of limited invitations to tender, at least three suitable applicants must be asked for the delivery levy in principle.</seg>
<seg id="441">According to the new Czech rules, it is inadmissible – apart from two special areas – to limit the number of bidders in un open procedures and negotiation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany the multi-eye principle must be taken into account in the selection of companies.</seg>
<seg id="443">Has e.g. an employee proposed a number of companies for a non-commercial procurement procedure, the management level of the building office or an agent from the remuneration must usually amend this proposal by removing, for example, a proposed company and/or supplementing it with a new company.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is intended to prevent a single person from finally being able to determine the circle of the companies involved in competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow far-reaching agreements among the parties involved.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of companies to be asked is confidential, including for freelance workers, and not to be made available in general.</seg>
<seg id="447">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic, appropriate regulations are not available to set up and hold applicants.</seg>
<seg id="449">According to the German regulations, the company must not determine the companies to be asked, but can only submit proposals to the remuneration.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.</seg>
<seg id="451">Essential audit results</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of applicants</seg>
<seg id="454">The prescription to request a minimum number of companies to bid in the event of non-commercial contracts has been complied with until a few exceptions.</seg>
<seg id="455">An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European procurement procedures of construction services in the high construction showed that the remedies in the case of limited invitations to tender of the Federal Government in Germany demanded an average of 4.4 companies on an average of 4.4 companies on the supply levy.</seg>
<seg id="456">A change from companies and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular, in gears with few providers, the remedies not always changed the circle of selected applicants.</seg>
<seg id="458">They took into account, above all, well-known and tried and tested companies.</seg>
<seg id="459">As a reason for this, they indicated that, in the event of non-commercial procedures, the suitability of the companies to be asked for competition must be ensured before the request for an offer.</seg>
<seg id="460">The BRH did not determine inadmissible restriction on regional bidders, but a higher proportion of regional-based companies than in public invitations to tender.</seg>
<seg id="461">The remedies led to this mainly due to the fact that the range of services is much lower on average in the non-commercial procurement procedures and therefore e.g. For example, there is a greater need for greater weight than public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Multiple-eye principle and proposals of freelance activities</seg>
<seg id="463">Contrary to the rules, the remedies are predominantly, the proposed list of companies to be asked by an independent person to be amended.</seg>
<seg id="464">They justified this in particular with a lack of machining capacities, deadlines or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.</seg>
<seg id="465">Nor was it often documented who proposed the companies requested for the supply levy.</seg>
<seg id="466">Some samples showed that freelance workers had established the applicant lists and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the remedies.</seg>
<seg id="467">In this way, the remedies did not protect themselves from possible manipulation in the necessary scope.</seg>
<seg id="468">Vertrauliche Behandlung der Bieterlisten</seg>
<seg id="469">In the event of a remuneration, the lists of companies to be asked in a data processing system were collected, which could be viewed by all employees of this service.</seg>
<seg id="470">In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the planned or authorized companies would have been unauthorized and e.g. We can discuss agreements under these companies.</seg>
<seg id="471">Dokumentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation of the procurement procedures contained only in a few cases explanations for the selection of applicants.</seg>

<seg id="474">Selection of applicants</seg>
<seg id="475">In the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive information about the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="476">In the case of non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the announcements contained no information on how the selection of applicants should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="477">In a procedure, all eight participating applicants fulfilled the qualification requirements, which exceeded the maximum number of companies in question.</seg>
<seg id="478">The award committee then carried out a lot of proceedings for the selection of companies.</seg>
<seg id="479">However, this procedure, which was fundamentally permitted at the time, should have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="480">Comprehensive observations</seg>
<seg id="481">Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of applicants in non-commercial procurement procedures, both countries have made special arrangements for preventing inadmissible restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">The German requirements restrict such abuse of abuse by means of the multi-eye principle, the secret of the bidder lists and the sole power of the remedies to be determined by the companies to be asked.</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of the Czech regulations, the newly introduced prescription of the largely unlimited number of bidders can counteract possible manipulative restrictions in the case of non-commercial procedures.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the test findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and the manipulation potential for an abusive restriction of the subscriber field has not been adequately reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Public clients should completely eliminate the deficits that have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="486">Offer phase</seg>
<seg id="487">The offer phase begins with the announcement of the award or with the request for the bid to be provided, in which the companies can create offers on the basis of the award documents sent to them.</seg>
<seg id="488">Applicants may submit their offers until the expiry of the bid period set by the remuneration.</seg>
<seg id="489">EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">There are no separate EU law requirements for this phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The remedies have to comply with the national regulations aimed at counteracting the manipulation possibilities that exist during the offer phase.</seg>

<seg id="494">Equal or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="495">The award documents, on the basis of which companies are to create their offers, are in principle only sent by the registry.</seg>
<seg id="496">The freelance case involved in the procurement process must not take on this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The remuneration has to ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of ambiguities in the award documents or other questions relating to tendering, the remuneration of information to the applicants may only be granted.</seg>
<seg id="499">Requirements commissioned by the creation of the award documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the entire phase of the offer, contact between the requested freelance workers and the applicants must be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="501">The freelance workers must not become a hub of the procurement procedure, which can be established through contacts with anti-competitive consequences.</seg>
<seg id="502">The offers submitted by post or directly transmitted are submitted in a closed envelope.</seg>

<seg id="519">The tested building management did not predominantly include the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding of the contact persons for queries and information.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the performance descriptions, they did not accept employees from the remuneration, but from the project lines as contact persons.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some award documents even contained the names of the freelance workers who had created the performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="522">In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information in the event of questions during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="523">Labelling of offers</seg>
<seg id="524">All offers received with entrance stamps and receivables have been added to the certified building management.</seg>
<seg id="525">For some free-handed contracts, the offers were made in the case of freelance workers, which contradicted the preference for corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Staying of offers</seg>
<seg id="527">After their labelling, not all offers were immediately and immediately used for the servants responsible for custody, which included the offers in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">In a building office, the offers were in an open specialist in the post office, to which every servant had access.</seg>

<seg id="532">No defects have been criticised on the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="533">Comprehensive observations</seg>
<seg id="534">In both countries, contacts between interested companies and the procurement process are to be prevented during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="535">By obtaining the same information, the principle of equal treatment is also to be safeguarded.</seg>
<seg id="536">The rules on the entrance to the custody and secrecy of the offers are suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">The corresponding requirements in Germany are a little more comprehensive than the ones in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The results of the investigation in Germany have caused infringements of the rules in some areas.</seg>

<seg id="588">Comprehensive observations</seg>
<seg id="589">The regulations of both countries to open up the offers agree in significant parts. They take account of the multi-axis principle as well as the principle of transparency. This allows the risk of corruption and manipulation to be considerably limited in the opening up of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="590">The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as the labelling, the safe custody and the secrecy of the offers restrict manipulation possibilities such as e.g. In the event of subsequent changes to the offers.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, we must not carry out any other tasks relating to the performance to be allocated with the opening up of offers.</seg>
<seg id="593">The total of only a few complaints proves the high level of acceptance of the opening up of supply.</seg>
<seg id="594">Testing and valuation of offers</seg>
<seg id="595">Inspection and valuation of the offers The client has to check and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="596">He has to determine the offer for the granting of the surcharge, which best suits the requirements according to the given award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="597">EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">The EU's requirements provide for a multi-stage procedure:</seg>
<seg id="599">First of all, the suitability of the bidders is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="600">Bieters must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="601">Companies must be excluded from participating in the awarding process, e.g. For bribery or fraud crimes, it is legally convicted.</seg>
<seg id="602">The offers of the non-exclusive bidders are calculated in mathematical terms, technically and economically and must be evaluated on the basis of the previously known award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to check in particular.</seg>
<seg id="604">The examination and valuation of the offers is a particularly manipulating phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements will be kept in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">By favouring or disadvantageing bidders, the result of the value can be impaired and thus prevented the establishment of the most economically advantageous offer.</seg>
<seg id="607">The remuneration therefore has special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for examining and evaluating comply with the requirements of integrity and expertise.</seg>
<seg id="608">It also has to ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.</seg>
<seg id="609">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Equal or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="611">According to the requirements of the EU, the offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements of the companies to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the valuation and their weighting are determined in the announcements or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">After testing the bidding, the design criteria may no longer be used in the value of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="614">The value has to be limited to the contract criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">Initially, the submitted offers formally check whether they are complete and whether in them e.g. There are also striking problems that could point to possible manipulation intentions.</seg>
<seg id="616">If Bieter is excluded from further examination and valuation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the value of the offers gives an inappropriate price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to give an opinion before a possible exclusion of his or her offer.</seg>
<seg id="618">The decisions taken in the examination and valuation of the offers are comprehensible to document.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the secret offers must only be made available to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.</seg>
<seg id="621">The supervision of the offers as well as the calculation of the offers may only be carried out by the registry.</seg>
<seg id="622">It only has to use officials who are not involved in the awarding decision or the implementation of the measure.</seg>
<seg id="623">The perception of the further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated.</seg>
<seg id="624">If freelance matters are entrusted with the examination and value, they have to treat the offers confidentially.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the remuneration points.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, the offerings must be made to verify and evaluate the offers.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees create evaluation reports with proposals.</seg>
<seg id="628">In the end, as in Germany, only the remuneration offices have to decide.</seg>
<seg id="629">In Germany, proofs or declarations are only submitted in an incomplete manner in Germany, the remuneration has the opportunity to give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only when the documents are still not available after the expiry of the deadline is the offer of the value to be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the remuneration whether it gives the bidders the opportunity to complete a lack of evidence or explanations.</seg>
<seg id="632">If this leaves a bidder, it must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="634">Based on the price structure of the offer, references to low or high prices for partial services, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id="635">If this is not due and can lead to the proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is intended to prevent bidders from speculating on essential quantities of quantities in the calculation of their supply, which can lead to significant cost increases in construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic the total price is valued, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.</seg>
<seg id="638">A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">A surcharge may not be granted in Germany on offers with inappropriate high or low prices.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more offers are subject to the applicable price determination of the client or the offer of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders have to prove the proper limestone tion of their offers.</seg>
<seg id="641">If this is not possible, the remuneration may exclude the offers in question.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the tender can be lifted after examining the cost-effectiveness if only offers with unjustifiable at low prices are available.</seg>
<seg id="643">In contrast to the German procurement law, the surcharge for offers with significantly above the calculation of the client cannot be denied for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="644">If in Germany there is suspicion of a competitive behaviour, the remuneration immediately has to report to its specialist supervision at the leading level.</seg>
<seg id="645">This has to decide what measures are to be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.</seg>
<seg id="646">The specialist supervision level must be made for e.g. also in the case of construction services over 50,000 euros, if freely granted, a surcharge is not given to the offer with the lowest price or the tender should be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="647">There are no relevant regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">Essential audit results</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Eignation and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">The vast number of procurement procedures that have been tested corresponded to the prescribed requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">For some companies proposed by freelance workers, the remedies did not review the suitability of companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">Companies commissioned to use a recipient without the need for the required suitability of the suitability.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the case of some procedures, it was incomprehensible whether the remuneration had taken into account all the award criteria made known to them in their selection decision or whether they had only laid the criterion “price” for their awarding decision.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of the persons and secrecy of the offers involved</seg>
<seg id="656">Some remedies did not use authorized persons to check the offers for this.</seg>
<seg id="657">In this way, freelance workers, or with the planning or implementation of a construction project, carried out tasks that were only perceived by employees of the remuneration.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, employees with the examination of the offers have also worked with those who have not been obliged to maintain the offers and to the conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="660">For the construction services, it was also incomprehensible whether the offers at the freelance profession were only accessible to persons directly commissioned with the processing.</seg>
<seg id="661">Transparency and calculation of the offers</seg>
<seg id="662">Some remedies handed over the open offers of freelance workers to further examination, without prejudice to the prescribed transparency of the offers and the calculative examination itself and to have taken their results doku- ment.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties would have been able to make changes to the offers without being comprehensible to the remuneration points.</seg>
<seg id="664">In the documents tested, there were partially not or insufficiently marked insurgents or a lack of price or product information.</seg>
<seg id="665">Economical assessments</seg>
<seg id="666">In the case of a sample in a high-rise management, the cheapest offers for three quarters of the tested procurement procedures differ more than 10% from the estimated costs of estimated costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">Each twentieth awarding procedure has been lifted due to inappropriate offer prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">Not all audits and information talks with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, more detailed information was lacking, such as the single prices of the most important positions.</seg>
<seg id="670">Often the deviations were only flat-rate, e.g. through references to changed market prices or increased material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction services declared that the detection and evidence of mixed calculations is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the event of an invitation to tender for a institution of public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the estimated value of these services.</seg>
<seg id="673">Further calculation tests or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="674">In an information interview, the remuneration did not lay down evidence for price dumping of the company that was then commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="675">This remained unclear whether the estimated value is excessive or the offer price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the client evaluated the commissioned company as a “bill company” that could not hold quality or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In the case of another tender, a building service office issued the surcharge to an offer, the price of which was 35% above the value of the cost assessment.</seg>
<seg id="678">They did not stop tendering and led to the fact that this company could be closed to a decent calculation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Verdacht auf Unregelmäßigkeiten</seg>
<seg id="680">In the case of a tested construction management, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the specialist supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical to an invitation to tender, so the remuneration excluded both offers from the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the application of the remaining regulations, the tests did not provide any significant complaints.</seg>
<seg id="683">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="684">Aptitude test</seg>
<seg id="685">In many of the tested construction projects, including higher education, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting offices of Bieter were not excluded from the procedure, even though they were not able to prove the requirements laid down in the tender documents or their suitability could not prove to be the prescribed extent. On the other hand, a remuneration in a case could not prove or explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Value</seg>
<seg id="687">In the awarding of construction services for a water treatment plant, the remuneration has not taken into account the given value criteria in the examination and valuation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="688">In the event of a construction project for the expansion of the rail network network, the remuneration laid the weighting of the value criteria only at the beginning of the value.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of road conservation measures, the pre-creating criterion “breaking of the construction phase” was miscalculated in a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the shortening offered in the second and third position has been inadequately taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of offer selection</seg>
<seg id="692">In the case of three procurement procedures in the context of housing promotion, the remuneration did not document the criteria they applied and on which basis they had selected the successful bidder.</seg>
<seg id="693">In the construction of a motorway, the registry selected the companies for smaller orders up to 20,000 euros alone due to telephone surveys at prices and delivery conditions.</seg>
<seg id="694">The tests of this selection were not possible, as the surveys were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Comprehensive observations</seg>
<seg id="696">The rules for examining and evaluating the offers correspond to the EU's requirements in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ from one another.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, the process is regulated by detailed requirements in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and for the protection of offers more than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered must be examined.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, some of the verified procurement procedures had to state that essential procedural steps were not or insufficiently documented when examining and evaluating the offers.</seg>
<seg id="701">However, without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly serious shortcoming was the handover of all offers to third parties without the public client being sufficiently informed and documented and thus protected from possible manipulation in the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="703">If public entities allow tasks to be carried out in the examination and valuation of the offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and increased control effort are required in order to avoid the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">When examining the appropriateness of the prices, the audited services in Germany have not always taken advantage of the given set of instruments and the price structure of the offers has not been sufficiently investigated.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, complaints have been made, especially in the event of a suitability, as well as in the application of the value criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After testing and values of the offers, the awarding process will be completed by issuing the grant or by lifting the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">Companies have the opportunity to check and apply the intended awarding of an electronic route or fax within 10 days or other means of communication within 15 days. to initiate a verification procedure.</seg>
<seg id="711">A contract must not be concluded before the end of this information period.</seg>
<seg id="712">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="713">If a bidder provides a verification request within the information period, a conclusion of the contract is only possible after the final decision in the verification procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">Companies can also review the awarding decision within the framework of this verification procedure by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">The verification process is intended to guarantee the legal protection of companies and to stop the client throughout the awarding process to observe the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="716">To this end, it must adequately document the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="717">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Equal or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the registry has to decide on the award ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and value of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="722">The client shall grant the order within the given surcharge period,</seg>
<seg id="723">also because the bidders are no longer bound to their offers after the deadline expires.</seg>
<seg id="724">In the event of open and non-open procedures or public and limited invitations to tender, the client must not deviate from the content of the offer at the time of conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="725">The inferior bidders must be informed promptly about the award decision and the reasons for the non-consideration of their offers.</seg>
<seg id="726">procurement procedures may only be lifted under certain conditions, e.g. if the offer prices are excessive or the offers do not comply with the requirements of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the 10 or 15-day information and waiting obligation is also available for the non-European construction services to be awarded in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide contracts.</seg>
<seg id="730">In the case of the other procedures in Germany, the bidders can only be informed about the awarding of the award after the award ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure is to be lifted if only one offer has been made or only an offer has been evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the surcharge must also be granted in the case of only one precious offer, provided that this corresponds to the terms and conditions of the tender and is economically.</seg>
<seg id="733">Essential audit results</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">In the event that the awarding procedures were concluded, complaints were only made in a few cases.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, companies in EU-wide contracts have already been writing letters before the end of the information period, which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In addition, order letters for open procedures contained in individual cases of the content of the offer, such as content deviating from the content of the offer, e.g. changed deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, the clients did not stop the surcharge periods.</seg>
<seg id="739">In the event of an open procedure, a remuneration shall therefore be awarded to the second most advantageous offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer after the expiry of the contract was no longer prepared to execute the services at the price originally offered.</seg>
<seg id="740">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="741">In the event of a construction of a tree in the higher education sector, the remuneration in the content of the bidder shall depend on the offer of the bidder.</seg>
<seg id="742">In the case of some contracts, for example in the case of construction activities of road construction, in the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the remedies closed the contracts after the expiry of the statutory period.</seg>
<seg id="743">In the awarding of construction services to the rehabilitation of former military attachments, the remuneration led to the communication on the award ceremony only after the expiry of the statutory period of all bidders.</seg>
<seg id="744">Comprehensive observations</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements for the conclusion of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of the inferior applicants or bidders increases the instruments of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The scope of legal protection is also extended in the Czech procurement law to contracts below the EU threshold values.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, exceeding the deadlines for the placing of the order has been identified.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">The construction administrations should avoid the shortcomings that have been identified in the event of the conclusion of their procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement procedures are comprehensible during their individual stages with regard to the crucial observations and the justifications of the individual decisions.</seg>
<seg id="753">In the case of EU-wide procedures, the orders granted must be made known.</seg>
<seg id="754">The order data will also be collected in an EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption through the documentation of procurement procedures will implement a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency budget.</seg>
<seg id="756">A carefully and prompt documentation allows the traceability of the award decisions.</seg>
<seg id="757">In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders in order contracts above the EU threshold values.</seg>
<seg id="758">proper documentation is also an essential part of the prevention of corruption, as the coercion, awarding decisions to be justified in detail, have a significant impact on manipulation margins.</seg>
<seg id="759">The disclosure of a commissioned order for an EU-wide procurement procedure has to provide the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.</seg>
<seg id="760">The office publishes the announcements in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The remedies also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and to report on the relevant national ministries of the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the EU Commission draws up an EU statistics on this basis, which will enable them to gain an overview of the development of the internal market in the construction services.</seg>

<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the publication obligation for issued orders is not limited to the EU-wide contracts, but also covers the other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notice period is reduced to 15 days.</seg>

<seg id="777">In the event of a procurement procedure, the remuneration did not exist why they granted a company the order, although its offer had not been included.</seg>
<seg id="778">In a few cases, the documents of the remedies did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="779">Announcements about order divisions</seg>
<seg id="780">In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the remuneration authorities failed to make the issuing of orders known.</seg>

<seg id="790">Dokumentation</seg>
<seg id="791">In the case of construction measures for the alignment of a large sporting event, the documentation of procurement procedures had considerable shortcomings. These were mainly incorrect information, such as false prices in the protocols of the Commission's commissions.</seg>

<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">The construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and orders and comply fully with their reporting and reporting obligations.</seg>
<seg id="802">Comprehensive evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two priorities, which are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the awarding of construction services by public clients: the application of EU sales rules and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">The requirements of EU law will enable cross-border competition to create a European internal market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Corruption prevention measures serve not only to avoid corruption or at least reduce it. They are also intended to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit skills of the two courts of invoice for the application of the public regulations in both countries and the comparison of these regulations provide information on common ground and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the development of their procurement law and their application.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU labelling rules</seg>
<seg id="808">The EU's requirements for building services have transposed both countries into national law.</seg>
<seg id="809">In this way, there is an important common basis for the awarding of construction services and the consideration of the essential imperatives of competition, equal treatment for the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">The construction administrations of both countries have, in some cases, been very extensively prohibiting these bids by further administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements to the EU-wide construction services to their nationally adjustable procurement procedures below the EU threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the investigations carried out by the courts of auditors have shown that the construction administrations have not fully respected the requirements of EU law in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="813">The construction management in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints that have been identified in the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">The tests in the Czech Republic have mainly highlighted dangers that affect the cost-effectiveness of the duties.</seg>
<seg id="815">In this way, incomplete performance descriptions made additional services necessary, which were often granted in violation of legislation. In addition, the cost investigations were usually inadequately drawn up. Even reduced qualification requirements, the number of possible bidders and restricted in particular the competition in the transport buildings.</seg>
<seg id="816">Korruptionsvorbeugung</seg>
<seg id="817">The investigations did not aim to uncover cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="818">also because the courts do not have an appropriate set of instruments for this.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the courts of auditors can examine to what extent the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">In the case of corruption, both countries have set different priorities.</seg>
<seg id="821">The German regulations mainly provide for a largely unrestricted competition and transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech regulations are aimed primarily at increased transparency in procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of the prevention of corruption apply, which the entire Federal Administration has to apply.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles are also implemented in the requirements for the awarding of construction services and are geared towards their specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="826">In the relevant regulations, it is sometimes very precisely defined in the way in which the bids for the prevention of corruption must be taken into account at the end of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the opinion of the BRH, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is, in particular, an appropriate instrument for reducing the risk of corruption in the awarding of construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative intervention.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analyses and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore does not see any fundamental change in the requirements of the administrations in the awarding of construction services.</seg>
<seg id="830">The rules on the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The deficiencies identified in partial areas have identified inadequacies in the implementation of certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">The construction administrations should continue to train their employees on the requirements for corruption and raise them even more sensibly for this issue.</seg>
<seg id="833">An essential part of the complaints referred to tasks that the construction administrations had delegated to freelance sites.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases by delegating tasks.</seg>
<seg id="835">We should only transfer manipulation and risk-threatening tasks to third parties if the administration can guarantee adequate protection against unacceptable interventions.</seg>
<seg id="836">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="837">The Czech Republic decided at government level against corruption, in which the public procurement sector forms the most important part.</seg>
<seg id="838">The awarding law and the accompanying implementing provisions have been substantially changed.</seg>
<seg id="839">The tests of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, as the remuneration places justify and publish the cost-effectiveness of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the appropriateness of qualifications, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the assessments and have to document and publish all these aspects properly.</seg>
<seg id="841">recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">The NKÚ and the BRH are fundamentally positive about the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">The far-reaching acceptance in practice has confirmed that EU bids of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the allocation of construction services within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous material and ideological potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both courts of auditors are calling for the construction administrations in their countries to continue and, if necessary, to continue their actions against corruption and manipulation. still to be improved.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisation and procedures of awarding procedures should be continually investigated on weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.</seg>
<seg id="847">Comparison of procurement practice in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider area for competition and can reduce the risk of corruption considerably.</seg>
<seg id="848">A stronger division of construction services in Lose can also have a beneficial impact on supply prices, provided that greater competition is achieved with a higher number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring the correct implementation of the procurement procedures is an essential basis for an efficient activity of public clients.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks – with the exception of the transport projects – are perceived by the portfolios themselves or by the contractors responsible.</seg>
<seg id="851">The courts of auditors of both countries are concerned, even after the completion of their joint project, which will continue to develop important findings for them. to Parliament and the government of their country.</seg>
<seg id="852">Both courts of auditors are also convinced that the principles of procurement law and its implementation set out in this report are also of interest at international level of the International Organisation of the Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI). The principles and findings outlined are of general importance in order to combat corruption effectively and to ensure economic procurement of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Management of VAT in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the control test</seg>
<seg id="3">Preface</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes are the most important source of income for public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="5">A focus of the activities of the courts should therefore be on examining this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">This applies in particular to VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">This alone creates tax losses of an estimated EUR 100 billion in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="8">Already at the VI. EUROSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005 showed the participants the need for enhanced cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">This allows the invoices to be exchanged, e.g. audit approaches, and to optimize the audit practice.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT (USt) is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2006, the courts of invoices of both states examined for the first time parallel in the field of USt.</seg>
<seg id="12">The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the USt fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the courts of auditors is needed. This can fully assess whether the measures taken are appropriate to deal effectively with the USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two courts of auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carry out a second parallel examination. Management of VAT in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Test number:(CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">The object of examination: (CZ) management of the USt (D) Bilateral examination with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as NKÚ), control test</seg>
<seg id="18">The aim of examinations:</seg>
<seg id="19">The U.S.t management and the treatment of selected sales between entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as Germany). In addition, the procedures applied by the financial authorities should be investigated in the procedure applied to the intergovernmental assistance.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The examination should evaluate how financial management has implemented the recommendations made by the courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, other audit fields associated with the USt should be processed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The observations made in this regard should be compared to determine whether the tax procedures can be optimized.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audit period was the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the time before the examination period until the conclusion of the examination.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of the results and evaluation of parallel testing</seg>
<seg id="25">The courts of auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed to check the management of the USt.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the previous parallel examination, they had uncovered suspicions with intra-Community sales;</seg>
<seg id="27">which had been published again and again.</seg>
<seg id="28">Due to the test findings, the two courts of auditors made recommendations on the management of the USt.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aim of the control test was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the suspicions identified should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The examination also dealt with other facts. These included selected cases of risky intra-Community sales, mutual assistance in the recovery of USt ratings and the USt check in large companies.</seg>
<seg id="31">In doing so, the courts of auditors have identified:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Given the previous examination, recommendations</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: The rules governing the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the first examination, the courts of auditors compared the registration procedures to the USt in the two states and set out differences that caused problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">The courts of auditors therefore recommend harmonising the registration of taxable persons within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This has also been taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft Novellation of Regulation No 1798/2003 of the Council provides that the current databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of the US-Preprilies, should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="38">The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible deletion.</seg>
<seg id="39">The courts expected the Member States to agree on appropriate rules in accordance with their fundamental decision in order to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the USt system as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">Over the last version of the draft, the Member States reached political agreement in Ecofin.</seg>
<seg id="41">The aforementioned common rules are no longer included. The two courts of auditors regret this.</seg>
<seg id="42">They still consider such rules to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: monthly presentation of the summary messages as a result of the first examination recommended the invoices to the Member States that the summary messages (ZM) should be submitted monthly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="44">The amounts of intra-Community sales could then be checked for time.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common VAT system for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community sales, the deadline for issuing ZM has been reduced to a month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the CZ, this prescription was implemented by a Novelle of the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, implementation came into force only on 1 July 2010. It has not transposed the obligation for the monthly issue of the ZM into national law on time.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Data synchronization of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of the procedures for US pre-registrations and ZM to examine the German financial management has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: exchange for successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level in the course of the first examination was agreed by the two courts of auditors that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria and elements or approaches to a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in every EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The courts of auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems that have both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The NKU examined the system of exchange of information within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Court of Auditors concentrated on the German participation in the “Platform for Risk Management”.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Control check selected intra-Community sales</seg>
<seg id="57">In the first examination, the courts had examined sales, which were doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been declared differently by the taxable persons of the two states in the U.S. pre-registrations (or USt declarations) or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="58">The courts of auditors chose nine cases intra-Community product deliveries between the CZ and Germany for the control check.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits by the financial offices (FÄ) of both states have not yet been completed at the end of the first parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="60">The control test has shown that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. The respective financial administrations had taken appropriate measures to this end (e.g. subsequent U.S. tests or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community sales</seg>
<seg id="62">The examination also included heavily risky intra-Community sales between taxable persons in the EU, which were covered by the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is used to detect risky taxable taxers.</seg>
<seg id="64">The Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">The CZ is active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">This could not provide information on which suppliers would have been classified as highly risky cases with German USt ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">The NKU noted both normal business incidents and those with suspicion of USt fraud at the selected sales, including carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="69">The FÄs could only check high-risk sales in a limited way. This was particularly done in the case of so-called “missing traders”, with a review of documents hardly enough to be able to prove to the taxable fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the event of suspicion of carousel fraud in imports and exports</seg>
<seg id="71">It is advisable for the customs and tax authorities to cooperate more closely in order to be able to pursue the insulation of goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany and a number of other countries have rejected active participation in EUROCANET, as they do not believe that there is a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Federal Court of Auditors found that the German financial management uses other instruments to identify risky taxable taxable.</seg>
<seg id="74">There is, however, a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The EU Council agreed on a draft regulation.</seg>
<seg id="76">by the EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be included in the planned network for combating the USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Official assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">The intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are dealt with in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Federal Court of Auditors and NKU compared the statistics that both Member States forwarded to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">These statistics contained disagreements.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two courts of auditors consider a renewed discussion on the statistics at EU level to be useful in order to avoid existing disagreements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="84">If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the statistics should contain more information on the US.</seg>
<seg id="86">An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support the Member States in their efforts to combat the US.</seg>
<seg id="87">Both courts of auditors believe that Member States should endeavour to achieve at least the average recovery rate with a low recovery rate.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Commission should support the Member States in this if this is desired.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. UST exam at large-scale enterprises</seg>
<seg id="90">The courts analysed the legal situation with regard to the USt check in large companies in both states.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they collected information from the financial administrations, which they considered important in this context, with a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="92">It was clear that the situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="93">The CZ has a system for the selection of risky cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information about USt checks, data from balance sheets as well as profit and loss invoices).</seg>
<seg id="94">The USt control can thus be effectively controlled and analysed as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="95">A special financial office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is still no comparable system in Germany. This makes it difficult to control and analyse USt control as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="97">The German financial management focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies, in particular, on data from the USt pre-registrations or U.S. declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="98">Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Testing procedures</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Testing procedures in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">The department II - State budget revenue and the regional departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava check in the period May 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="102">Tested places were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FY: Financial Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FA in Hodonín, FA in Hradec Králové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA in Písek, FA in Pilsen, FA Prague 1, FA Prague 4, FA Prague 8, FA in Rakovník, FA in Sokolov, FA in Tábor, FA in Vysoké Mýto, FA in Zlín and FA in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Testing procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit area of traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich examined from February 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:</seg>
<seg id="107">• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. In addition, they led interviews in the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="108">Taxes from the following law have been included in the examination: • Erlangen, central financial office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in the Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, special financial office Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="109">Discussions have also been held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Federal Court of Auditors announced the audit results in April 2010 to the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two courts of auditors</seg>
<seg id="112">In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both courts met in September 2008, to discuss and define the examination topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">In December 2008, the presidents of both courts signed the agreement on cooperation in parallel auditing.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the test teams were informed of the initial results obtained during the preparation preparation, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on the further action.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting took place from 2 to 4 December 2009 in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="116">The test teams exchanged the audit knowledge gained until then and agreed the schedule for the creation of the joint audit report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two courts of auditors laid down the following topics for their parallel examination: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • verification of selected cases intra-Community sales between taxable persons from the CZ and from Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • Review as a risk-resistant selected intra-Community sales between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany; • examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to the intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of USt ratings; • U.S. checks for large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel review was drawn up during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Review of the management of VAT in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint examination</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Harmonisation of the preconditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">on the results of the first test, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended that the requirements for the transfer tax registration be adapted and new rules for the deletion of registration in the CZ should be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="125">These amended rules should reduce the risk of possible tax evasion more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="126">In certain cases, it has been noted that the FÄs did not delete the transfer tax registration of taxable persons if they did not comply with their obligations under the Czech Law No 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the “USt Act”.</seg>
<seg id="127">So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted any revision in order to oblige the FÄ to the deletion if the taxable persons do not repeatedly submit U.S. declarations.</seg>
<seg id="128">In accordance with the Czech U.S. Act, the FA may delete the registration of a taxable person of office for a period of time if a) the taxable person for twelve consecutive months has not made transactions and the FA has not informed the reasons for this; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his duties under the U.S. Act; c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the conditions for tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="129">The first test had shown that the FA Prague 1 must delete the US-registration of “foreign taxable”3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year as a result of the existing legal situation, if they were not obliged to register and pay USt in the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the USt registration of these taxable persons because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was solved by the revision of the USt law, which came into force on 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">Thus, the FA has the power to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if it has not provided tax-free or tax-free delivery of goods or services in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monatliche Abgabe der ZM</seg>
<seg id="135">Due to the first examination, the courts had recommended to introduce the monthly delivery of ZM.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council's directive, which shortened the Turnus for the issuing of ZM to a month, was implemented in the CZ by the US Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The ZM must now be handed over electronically.</seg>
<seg id="138">In addition, a ZM must be issued if services, the place of performance of which is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) of the U.S. Act, are provided for a person registered in another Member State as a value-added tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The prerequisite is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the USt for these services. This obligation stems from the Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC concerning the place of service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of the data of the USt prior notifications and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation referred to the German financial management.</seg>
<seg id="142">In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial management automatically resembles the data on intra-Community sales from the USt declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">The proper collection of USt is a sine qua non for the smooth functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">That is why the fight against the USt fraud is of paramount interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.</seg>
<seg id="148">It estimated an external expert to be an external expert for the 25 Member States in the period 2000 to 2006. According to the evaluation of the available data, the tax failure for the aforementioned period was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros. It was based on the fact that the EU-25 lost an average of 12% of the sales taxes due to them every year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The estimated tax failure for CZ was 18% in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="150">In the first test, it was found that a Member State could not develop an effective risk management system (RMS).</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches to an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">Concerning the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has examined the system for exchanging information within the EU (EUROCANET).</seg>
<seg id="153">The taxable intra-Community sales carried out in EUROCANET have been selected by taxable persons within the EU (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The EUROFISC network is intended to optimise administrative assistance in tax matters and to combat the USt fraud more effectively. The cooperation of the competent authorities is to be improved in order to identify cases of fraud as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to assess risk potential for intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="156">The Ecofin Council approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and, at the same time, adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.</seg>
<seg id="157">As a model for EUROFISC, EUROCANET, which has been developed by the Belgian financial management in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7.</seg>
<seg id="158">The purpose of the system is to uncover low-risk sales and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organised USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following observations:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German financial management has developed a well-functioning system for registering taxable persons on the basis of a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this Commission system in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system itself is constantly being improved.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data provided in the questionnaire will now be recorded electronically and will be available later for investigations. They are therefore part of the risk management in registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission had made a proposal8 to amend Regulation 1798/2003. This provided for common standards for the registration and deletion of tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="168">There was still a need for clarification and clarification among the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended the Federal Ministry of Finance not to go back to the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monatliche Abgabe der ZM</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, a law on the implementation of EU directives in national law was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="173">Among other things, it contains provisions on the monthly delivery of the ZM for intra-Community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="174">and will enter into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of the data of the USt prior notifications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and reflections on the merger of the previously separated procedures for the USt prior notifications and the ZM</seg>
<seg id="177">A common federal-state working group has been set up.</seg>
<seg id="178">which has developed a concept for the automatic synchronization of the data from the U.S. pre-registrations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="179">The concept is currently being discussed with the countries.</seg>
<seg id="180">In addition, this working group has dealt with a concept for optimizing the control procedure for intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level at EU level will exchange relevant information.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the relevant initiative and initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the action plan "Fiscalis 2006-2007" in the written procedure of 18 October 2006.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform were involved in 4 sub-groups with the following topics: • risk management instruments, • influence of the behaviour of taxable persons, • evaluation, • updating of the guide to risk management.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports of the “Risikoman ManagementIn Instruments” and “Actualization of the Guide to Risk Management” were published at the beginning of 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The question of the conditions for the USt registration and its deletion in various countries has been dealt with at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft novellated Regulation 1798/2003 of the Council on the cooperation of administrative authorities in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of the current databases within the EU, including a database of USt identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">This proposal also includes common standards for registration and deletion of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="192">The questions of registration and deletion are reserved for further national legislation of EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">There was still a need for clarification and clarification among the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">Over the last version of the draft, the Member States reached political agreement in Ecofin on 8 June 2010.</seg>

<seg id="201">With regard to international cooperation, it was recommended as a result of the previous review that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to enable an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="202">The Council's RL 2008/117/EC amending the RL 2006/112/EC on the common VAT system for the purpose of combating tax fraud for intra-Community sales has shortened the turn of the relevant ZM to a month.</seg>

<seg id="211">The Federal Court of Auditors focused on the German participation in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Control check selected intra-Community sales</seg>
<seg id="213">In the first examination, sales were examined together, with doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or inconsistencies in the notifications of the taxable persons in both Member States had been identified.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two courts of auditors chose nine cases intra-Community product deliveries between the CZ and Germany, in which the tax audit was not yet completed by the law of the Member State concerned at the time of the previous joint examination.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxable person acquired a German taxable goods worth EUR 22 686.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxable person declared the acquisition not in his USt declaration, Daderdeutsche taxable period, not a US-Id identification number, but only a tax number for intra-German sales.</seg>
<seg id="218">Through international assistance in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA has received information that, according to German USt law, the supplier does not require intra-Community goods intra-Community goods to be able to use the tax exemption of intra-Community goods deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="219">The control test by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the examination of the competent Czech FA - the Czech taxable person submitted an additional U.S. declaration, in which he declared the purchase of goods in the above value and at the same time claimed his claim to deduction of VAT at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">A Czech tax obligation is to have acquired from a German taxable goods worth 12 561 euros in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">He said, however, that he did not buy the goods and therefore did not declare in his USt declaration.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German financial management rejected it in accordance with a provision of the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 to process the request, because the sales linked to the purchase did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">As the Czech FA was unable to obtain documents, the tax audit remained resultsless and the original tax setting exists.</seg>
<seg id="225">The control test by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 according to which the German taxable person had invoiced the goods in question to a Slovak address.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxable person acquired the goods from the Slovak taxable person and gave the acquisition in his regular USt declaration for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">A Czech tax obligation is to have acquired a car worth 48 500 euros in the fourth quarter of 2004 by a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, he did not declare intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, he has not made any more U.S. declaration since August 2004. That is why the FA set the USt for the quarter in question with 0 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="231">As a result of information transmitted from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information according to the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA called for the taxable persons in March 2007 to provide a subsequent tax declaration, but the taxable person would be left.</seg>
<seg id="232">The control test found that the FA had carried out further audits in this tax case in 2007. It was stated that the passenger car in question had been sold by the taxable person to a second-hand car dealer in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech FA led to a predisposition to the December 2004 tax period and set additional taxes amounting to 295 379 CZK for the purchase of goods from another Member State and their resale.</seg>
<seg id="234">The competent Czech court decided to open an insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Czech taxable person; an insolvency administrator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">For example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve’s policy of quantitative easing (QE) and the Fed’s policy of quantitative easing (QE) (QE).</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxable taxer will have delivered new vehicles (Pkw) in the overall value of EUR 167 to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="238">In the answer to a request for information in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 it was said that a tax penalty procedure in Germany was pending against the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="239">The control audit of the Federal Court of Auditors showed that, after the completion of the procedure, evidence for the involvement of the German taxable person in fraud was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="240">Intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to the purchase of employment in the amount of 182 424 Euro (for 2004) and 369 690 Euro (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech taxable person was involved in carousel fraud with new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of an information from the German financial management, a USt check of the Czech taxable person took place for the period of taxation of April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the test findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA set additional USt amount of 703 031 CZK for May 2005 and 726 551 CZK for June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">The Czech taxable A should have acquired a machine in the overall value of 58 000 euros in February 2005 by a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="246">In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxable person shall have delivered a machine worth 88 027 euros to the Czech taxable B. However, the purchase is the only one.</seg>
<seg id="247">The control test of the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with branch in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech taxable A gave the purchase of the goods from the aforementioned German taxable person not in his USt declaration.</seg>
<seg id="249">The response of the German FA to a request for information in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxable person had not made intra-Community delivery of a machine worth EUR 58 000, but a delivery within the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the control test, the Federal Court of Auditors stated that intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after the conclusion of an audit and that the USt exemption was then failed.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable taxer shall have delivered goods worth 11 600 euros to a Czech taxable goods.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were acquired and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The control audit of the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its predisposition on the basis of a complementary USt declaration, which was inadmissible from another Member State, including the acquisition of the above amount.</seg>
<seg id="255">The Federal Court of Auditors found that the German FA reported the USt declaration of the German taxable person and set additional USt to the tune of EUR 1 600 for a request for information in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="256">A review runs due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding USt-anlacement.</seg>
<seg id="257">The ZM of the German taxable person has not yet been corrected, as in Germany only the taxable person who issued the ZM can also correct it.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German financial administration in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the issue of the purchase of a car in the value of EUR 47 400 worth EUR 47 400 in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After an examination for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA fixed the tax debt of the Czech taxable person with 0 CZK and shared the German FA, it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="261">The control audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech US-Pollution had been deleted because it had not complied with its fiscal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="262">The Czech FA had forwarded the documents of the Czech police.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxable person has not corrected his or her data in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax law.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to MIAS10, a German taxable person between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 provided a Czech taxable goods in the overall value of 33 205 euros, which it did not declare intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="266">In the audit of the Czech Court of Auditors, it was noted that the Czech FA examined the reasons for the discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxable person, for the first quarter of 2005, was repeatedly subjected to retrospectively repaid US declarations.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech FA was not able to clarify the amount difference in the acquisition of 134 273 CZK in the period of third quarter 2004 until the first quarter of 2005. It justified the fact that sales could not be accurately assigned to individual quarters, and accepted the UST declarations issued.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person had delivered goods worth 46 854 euros to a Czech taxable goods.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only 14 856 euros.</seg>
<seg id="272">Within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA checked the actual value of delivery.</seg>
<seg id="273">The German response to this request has been submitted to three invoices, which expelled a total value of the delivered goods from 31 998 euros, i.e. an amount that corresponds to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxable person and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="274">According to the outcome of the control test by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxable person had submitted a retrospective US declaration for the July 2004 tax period after repeated warnings by the FA in January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="275">At the same time, with this declaration, the taxable person made his claim to deduction of VAT. His tax debt for the tax period in question therefore remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The control audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures were completed for the transactions selected for the examination and the financial administrations in the CZ or Germany had taken appropriate measures (including subsequent U.S. tests or prevention of pre-tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community sales</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Settings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET may be an important source of information in order to identify risky tax obligations in the Member State of acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the CZ the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET will be checked by the relevant FA at the purchaser.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has provided information on sales and taxable suppliers, which are considered to be risky, in the system EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="282">nine Czech taxable persons have been selected for the examination,</seg>
<seg id="283">the financial administrations of other Member States had either been entered as suppliers or purchases in the EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="284">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="285">As the German financial management did not participate in the exchange of data over EUROCANET, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers were classified as risk-free by the German financial management number by the German financial management.</seg>
<seg id="286">In the examination, both normal business incidents were identified, as well as those in which there was a suspicion of carousel fraud or other USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">In the cases in question, the FE exchanged information according to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">e.g. B.</seg>
<seg id="289">• In the case of the early warning information, the FÄ did not pay any suspicion of low-risk sales.</seg>
<seg id="290">The tax authorities in question have been continually monitored because their data were stored in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• The FÄ did not manage to prove the rules on the calculation of the tax base and the USt on the basis of the submitted accounting documents, even though they identified discrepancies in transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with mailbox companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• The review of individual business incidents has been complicated because certain taxable persons have not been able to be cooperated with the FY and have not been contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The competent law reviewed most of the risky tax obligations and sales mentioned in early warning from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="294">However, their possibilities for verifying risky sales, especially so-called “Missing Traders” are limited.</seg>
<seg id="295">In particular, a mere examination of documents can hardly prove to be fraudulent actions by the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="296">Stricter requirements for the registration of taxable for US and greater flexibility in the deletion of registrations would be helpful to combat the USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="297">The taxable persons involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for the purposes of the USt to pretend fictitious product deliveries to the EU or to formally provide legal correct fiscal evidence to other taxable persons with whom they then assert unauthorized claims on deductions.</seg>
<seg id="298">In the event of suspicion of carousel fraud in the context of imports and exports, it is advisable for customs and tax authorities to cooperate more closely in order to be able to pursue the insulation of goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not attend the European Parliament was regarded as weakness of the system at the end of 200811 which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with compulsory participation.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Settings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The Federal Court of Auditors evaluated data available at the Federal Central Office for Taxes, including such from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">They served as a basis for the selection of six German taxable persons whose files were checked.</seg>
<seg id="304">Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send any data to Brussels, but is only recipients of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">Begründet wird dies damit, dass „aus Sicht der Bundesregierung</seg>
<seg id="307">no doubt-free legal basis [existing] that would allow the tax secrecy in Germany to break through.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Federal Government has no reliable knowledge of how to process information sent by the Member States within the framework of EUROCANET (12 since October 2007 the Federal Central Office for Taxes expands EUROCANET data and transmits it to the financial authorities of the Federal Government and the countries on the basis of a coordinated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German FY will receive control communications on the immediate business relationships of the direct business relationships with companies registered in EUROCANET with companies from other EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the respective German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company has business relations with a company based in another Member State in another Member State, which is also linked to the German company from the control communication in business relationship.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="314">Accordingly, the examination in this area had to be carried out differently.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, significant differences in success in detecting USt fraud have not been identified. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only a component of the risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, the financial administrations of both countries have a large number of other instruments to uncover fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation of13, which was created by EUROFISC, a network for combating the US fraud.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should exchange the Member States at European level and be incorporated into this network.</seg>

<seg id="322">4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation on intergovernmental assistance to the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on it.</seg>

<seg id="326">the Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed implementing provisions on certain articles of Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain charges, customs duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">The CZ implements Council Directive 76/308/EEC by Law No 252/2000 on the intergovernmental assistance to recover certain claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Directive 2001/44/EC of the Council, it also had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, a revision of the aforementioned law was required.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, the Lawnovel No. 191/2004 on the intergovernmental assistance to the recovery of certain claims has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new relevant legislation was adopted by the Commission regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The plants for this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission compulsory and obliges the requested authority to certify the consistency of all transmitted documents with the respective original.</seg>
<seg id="332">The main principles of the international assistance to recover claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. The principle of reciprocity applies;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. Official assistance is always to be provided at the request and in the fulfilment of all the conditions;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. Official assistance does not extend to claims that apply in the requested state as criminal sanctions;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. The procedure for intergovernmental assistance to recover claims must be carried out in accordance with national law of the requested state;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. In the recovery process, foreign demands have no priority over domestic demands;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. Official assistance is only made for the recovery of undisputed claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. The principle of utilisation applies: the requesting state has all the means to recover the demand under national law.</seg>
<seg id="340">Law No. 191/2004 provides for three forms of official assistance: issuing information, delivery of acts and actual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="341">Verfahren für ausgehende Ersuchen an andere EU-Mitglied-staaten</seg>
<seg id="342">The competent FA has electronically forwarded the request for information, the request for delivery of legal acts or the request for recovery together with the relevant documents to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ, together with the relevant documents.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Ministry of Finance of the CZ prompts the translation of the request into the language in question, scans it with all plants and sends it through the communication network or the common interface CCN/CSI of the relevant financial authority of the relevant State.</seg>
<seg id="344">A request for recovery aid must fulfil the following conditions: the demand must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority can refuse to recover if the requirements are not met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedures for in-depth requests from other Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">The receipt of the request from other Member States must confirm the Ministry of Finance of the CZ as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.</seg>
<seg id="348">If it does not decide to provide the request, the requesting authority will notify the reasons for rejecting it, mentioning the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="349">The corresponding communication must be sent no later than three months after receipt of the receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance shall examine whether the request meets all legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="351">After that, it is intended to pass on the request to the relevant FA via the financial management in question. If the request for recovery is granted, the FA has to identify the debtor's assets, e.g. through excerpts from the base book, exploration of existing bank accounts and registration of automotive in the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="352">After six months from the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requested authority of the outcome of the investigations carried out.</seg>
<seg id="353">The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons in question are not achievable and the demand cannot therefore be made.</seg>
<seg id="354">All successful sums of money are transferred to the requested authority within a month after recovery.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech FA, dealt with with the recovery, can, with the consent of the requesting state, agree to the demand or arrange instalment payment.</seg>
<seg id="356">The interest or surcharges imposed on the debtor for the delay in delay in accordance with Law No. 337/1992 concerning the management of taxes and charges</seg>
<seg id="357">are on the requesting state.</seg>
<seg id="358">In the years 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ forwarded the requests for recovery received to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="359">The same applies to the forwarding of the requests for recovery provided by the Czech FÄs to the competent authority in the requested state.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit showed that the Ministry of Finance has violated the law on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims. It has failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="361">The situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">According to § 13 (4) of the Law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ each created a statistic for the European Commission until 15 March of the year. This includes the number of the request transmitted in the previous year and the request received for information, delivery of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims.</seg>
<seg id="364">On the basis of the data transmitted by the Member States, the European Commission draws up its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit showed that the Ministry of Finance of the CZ in 2008 was about EUR 5 250 000 too low. The reason was the incorrect indication of the amount of a USt relief (reduced by the postponement of a decimalomma in the conversion of the demand of Czech crowns in euros in 2008).</seg>
<seg id="366">The mistake then settled in the European Commission's statistics.</seg>

<seg id="370">In order for better readability and clarity, the EC-based directive codified Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197616 which had been substantially amended on several occasions.</seg>
<seg id="371">For example, the recovery of USt and taxes on income and assets, including related interest rates, fees and lowering surcharges, is regulated.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Grouping Directive was transposed into German law by the recovery law (EC)17 of 3 May 2003.</seg>

<seg id="376">The management of the financial authorities regulates, in particular, the enforcement and full instruction instructions.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the supreme financial authorities of the countries on the principles of state aid in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Tax Office for Tax18.</seg>
<seg id="378">General conditions for the admissibility of a recovery aid visit are:</seg>

<seg id="402">4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases</seg>
<seg id="403">A total of 21 intergovernmental requests for recovery were selected between the CZ and Germany. Below are ten cases where e.g.</seg>
<seg id="404">The following was noted:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German application for USt debt from a Czech taxable person from 2004 and 2005 in the total amount of 3 883 Euro (109 820 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="407">Only on 26 February 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance continued to search for the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the demand to join, the Czech FA contaminated a property belonging to the taxable property with a basic right of land.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since the burden was not sufficient to pay the entire tax debt, the debtor has made a rate of payment of at least 2 000 CZK per month.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31 August 2009, an interim report was forwarded to the German FA. As a result, the taxpayer has, in the meantime, paid tax debts of 49 600 CZK (as of 25 August 2009).</seg>
<seg id="411">The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly afterwards, on 28 August 2009, another 3 000 CZK was transferred.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, a recovery request for tax debts (USt, income tax) and interest and fees of a Czech taxable person of a total of 180 869 euros (= 4 434 915 CZK) went to the Czech Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="414">Only on 27 November 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance continued to search for the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="415">After verification of bank assets, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA stated that the debtor had not had adherent assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Investigations on the ground also showed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">The staff were very friendly and helpful.</seg>
<seg id="418">This communication received the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and continued the German financial management on 16 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, a German contributor to USt as well as interest and fees amounting to a total of 3 139 euros (= 84 846 CZK) went to the Czech Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="421">Only on 6 August 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance continued to search for the relevant FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany announced that the Czech tax debtor had to blame.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case was complete because the Czech tax debtor had completely paid his guilt in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the blame was also paid in the CZ within the framework of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to the long time that the Czech Ministry of Finance needed to forward information to the FA, the tax debt was paid twice - by the taxable person himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was found that the amount of money attached to the tax debt is offset from another procedure, which amounts to EUR 6 649 and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only a request for a contribution of 3 139 euros for the company in question. The staff were very friendly and helpful.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, a German contributor to income tax, USt, interest and fees amounting to a total of 39 957 Euro = 956 654 CZK went to the Czech Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="429">Only on 19 December 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance continued to search for the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="430">The recovery procedure was initiated on 1 June 2009. A decision on the attachment of the Czech bank credit and the salary of the debtor (7 000 CZK) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the level of tax debt and the amount is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been prepared in the past to pay EUR 250 per month, but the relevant German FA did not agree.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxable person secured his matter with the German FA to agree on another amount.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the examination by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On November 19, 2007, a German contributor to income tax of 2005 as well as USt for the years 2003 to 2007 was included in the Czech Ministry of Finance, as well as interest and fees amounting to a total of 113 444 Euro = 3 116 304 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="437">Only on 14 November 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance continued to respond to the FA Prague 1, which is not authorized to deal with tax cases in the CZ taxable tax obligation, based on the available address, a local competent FA could not be determined.</seg>
<seg id="438">In his investigations, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008 that the debtor's income was 4 704 euros. However, it was not possible to legislate because the request for recovery was received after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA introduced the recovery procedure and issued a execution order for the attachment of the debtor's credit to credit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the examination by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental assistance in the recovery due to a USt-Schuld, along with procedural costs of a total of 146 223 742 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="443">Only on 13 May 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance continued to search for the German financial management.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA transferred the amount of 17 700 Euro = 439 226 CZK to the Czech authorities, which was attached to the Czech authorities by attachment of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="445">A conversion error was discovered when checking the attached amounts.</seg>
<seg id="446">The subscription amount of 146 223 742 CZK was converted to the exchange rate of 1 Euro = 25,065 CZK, but due to a cafehler a amount of 583 378 euros emerged.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct amount of the subscription amount amounted to 5 833 782 euros.</seg>
<seg id="448">As a result, a EUR 5 250 404 has been asked for low recovery requests.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA asked for recovery due to a USt-Schuld, as well as interest and fees of a Czech taxable person of a total of 1 970 632 CZK = 79 847 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="451">Only on 10 November 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance continued to search for the German financial management.</seg>
<seg id="452">The German FA called for the debtor on 4 February 2009 to pay for residues.</seg>
<seg id="453">Taking into account the significant reduction in the sales of society in the second half of 2008 and, in particular, in the first half of 2009, as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax debt. On 8 April 2009 - 4 600 Euro, on 6 May 2009 -3 000 Euro and on 16 June 2009 - 2 500 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were transferred to the account of the relevant FA in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On June 23, 2009, another payment of 2 500 Euro to 30 June 2009 was agreed between the debtor and the FA.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">On May 22, 2008, the competent Czech FA asked for a total of 398 653 euros = 9 832 779 CZK; it was included, among other things, basic acquisition tax.</seg>
<seg id="458">Only on 2 October 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance continued to search for the German financial management.</seg>
<seg id="459">In a letter from the German financial management to the Czech Ministry of Finance of 3 April 2009, the request was returned.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German financial management thus justified the fact that the basic acquisition tax was not a tax in the sense of Article 2 e), f), g) and h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">In addition, Article 2 g) provides liabilities from taxes on income and assets.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC for taxes on income and assets, which are not mentioned in Article 1, paragraph 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed that a new request for recovery should be addressed to the German financial management, which should no longer include the basic acquisition residues of 61 759 CZK, but the residues at the USt, corporation and income tax.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the relevant FA for recovery of tax debts of the same taxable person amounting to 7 079 735 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA launched a request for income tax and USt to a total of 3 445 782 CZK = 123 328 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="467">The USt-Schuld was 1 133 967 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="468">Only on 18 April 2007 the Czech Ministry of Finance continued to request the recovery of the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="469">and only on 11 November 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech FA the response of the German financial management of 9 July 2007,</seg>
<seg id="470">According to the German FA on 11 June 2007, the German FA issued an order order for the attachment of the bank account. The Bank announced that it is not in business relationship with the aforementioned taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="471">In this way, the request for the German financial management was done as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA submitted a request for a contribution for USt debt to the Czech Ministry of Finance of a total of 1 296 845 CZK = 43 591 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="474">The relevant financial management gave the Ministry of Finance the request for 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance continued the request on 15 December 2005 to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before submitting the request, the Czech FA carried out the tax requirement by attaching the accounts to banks and salary attachments, as well as by burdening a property.</seg>
<seg id="477">In front of the request for recovery, the German financial management was sent to the German financial management on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">According to reply from 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxable person held his resident in Germany and had revenues from non-self-employed work of EUR 8 437. On April 20, 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received an answer to the request for recovery and only continued this on 12 February 2008 to the competent Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="479">After that, the tax debt in Germany is irrevocable due to the insolvency of the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="480">No assets have been identified, income from non-self-employed activity is already the subject of other enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German financial management looked at the request for it to be done.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of recovery, for all EU Member States, the requirements of EU law apply to the intergovernmental assistance.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">Federal Court and NKÚ have compared the statistics that the two Member States sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">Dabei fielen Unstimmigkeiten auf.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 2006 report, the European Commission recommended the Member States to draw up their statistics with greater care.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 2009, the Commission concluded that, despite a large number of requests for office, the disagreements in the statistics have decreased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both courts of auditors consider a renewed discussion at EU level to be sensible, so that the inconsistencies that still exist can be avoided in the future.</seg>
<seg id="490">If this does not happen, the statistics are meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the courts believe that the statistics are both the annual number of requests and the type of demands (e.g. B. USt, income tax and the amount of the amounts attached to the per Member State should expire.</seg>
<seg id="492">Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics presented by the Member States, the Commission could support the Member States in assessing their measures to combat the US fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">As the recovery rate per Member State can be calculated, the courts of auditors are in favour of the Member States seeking at least the average recovery rate within the EU with low quota.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.</seg>
<seg id="495">The foreign requests received in the Ministry of Finance of CZ were forwarded to the relevant law in particular in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="496">The same applies to the requests for recovery made by the Czech law.</seg>
<seg id="497">The examination showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance was opposed to Law No. 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery aid when it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State within the six-month period from the confirmation of receipt of the request for the progress of recovery measures.</seg>

<seg id="557">• What statistical records and evaluations of the USt test of large-scale companies are the management of the tax administration available?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there statistics or records of the extent to which a distinction is made between USt fraud and general USt check?</seg>
<seg id="560">CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such distinction.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The financial management does not distinguish between audits for combating USt fraud and general USt checks.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there statistics or records of the time close to the tests?</seg>
<seg id="563">CZ: The ATIS system collects information on the time proximity of tests intra-Community acquisition of selected U.S.</seg>
<seg id="564">The same applies to information about the beginning and end of the examination of the FA.</seg>

<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Accordingly, the statistics for auditors and USt special auditors compiled at federal level do not provide any information about “energy” audit fields.</seg>
<seg id="602">With regard to the analysis of such information, the benefits and the way in which they continue to use, different views have passed in the collection points.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some upper financial directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but it is free to decide whether or not to use them.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">As a result, the CZ will automatically process large amounts of information. For example, data from USt checks, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss invoices in the system are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="606">The CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases based on a wide range of information.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the evaluation and management of USt checks in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In the CZ, the establishment of a special financial pool for large companies is planned for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, financial management does not collect comparable amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="610">Accordingly, it is more difficult to fulfil these tasks in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="611">The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="612">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of the information in U.S. pre-registrations or U.S. declarations, as well as auditors, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the applicable taxation.</seg>
<seg id="614">In order to reduce revenue failures at the USt and at the same time to increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs, appropriate management processes and risk management systems are to be introduced.</seg>

<seg id="617">5. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation between the two courts of auditors has proved its worth.</seg>
<seg id="619">In this way, necessary knowledge of the systems applied in both countries could be obtained: this applies in particular: • internal community sales, • risk management in the USt, particularly with regard to the selection of risky sales, • the recovery of US-Treaches and • US-Proliferation of large-scale enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="620">The test laid down differences in the strategies for detecting USt fraud and the systems explained above.</seg>
<seg id="621">These findings can be used to improve the existing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="622">They can also be used to initiate a discussion among the interested authorities, which can be used to carry out audit approaches and strategies for combating fraud. This applies e.g. for the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The experience and knowledge gained are intended to encourage the management of the USt in the future.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. communique</seg>
<seg id="625">The report is created in Czech, English and German and signed by the Presidents of the Czech Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="626">State of the information: June 2010.</seg>
