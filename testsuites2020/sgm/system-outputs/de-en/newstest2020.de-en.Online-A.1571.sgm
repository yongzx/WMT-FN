<seg id="3">High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising living standards in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economic passenger and freight transport is an important task for the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="6">It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial efforts.</seg>
<seg id="7">When building and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="9">When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify deficiencies that prevent optimum economy, efficiency and effectiveness in expenditure on the construction of transport facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also to propose improvements for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and the Nejvy's Kontroln'ad (Nk) carried out parallel audits of the expenditure for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (Motorway D 8 in the Czech Republic and Motorway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooperation with the NA enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the course of the cooperation with the BRH, the NKA received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">In line with the progress of the planning, the date of completion was finally set for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the procurement procedure, the Road and Highways Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made errors which delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor promised the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint audit work, the prices of motorway bridges on the D8 and A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.</seg>
<seg id="24">A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square meter.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis showed that the border bridge was the most expensive among the large bridges with lengths of more than 100 m.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of the delays in the awarding of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The comparison of the prices of the tunnel works showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">In future audits of the economic viability of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH and NKO can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both courts recommend standardizing bridge constructions and performing steel composite and special constructions only where prestressed concrete constructions are inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The course of the examination was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel audit, the auditors from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report deals with parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The focus of the audit was on economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel audits were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the NA in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="36">in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The NA, the NKA examined the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway, amounting to approximately CZK 20 billion gross (approximately €690 million).</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million will come from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A17 motorway, irrespective of the parallel tests carried out with the NA in the years 2003 to 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of the €277 million of funding for the construction of all three sections of the A17, €277 million will be co-financed by European Funds (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - Central and South-Eastern Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech/German border,</seg>
<seg id="43">the A 17 from the border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the test, the sections of the motorways close to the border were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 is still in the planning phase over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice.</seg>
<seg id="47">Here the crossing of a landscape protection area in the Bohemian low mountains is planned.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the volume of traffic in 2008 in section 0807 of the D 8 motorway close to the border will be 22 940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 25,000 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a contract for the merger of the German A17 motorway and the Czech motorway D 8 at the common state border by the construction of a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction project was an important aspect of the parallel audits carried out by both courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and NNÉ</seg>
<seg id="53">From mid-2005, the two courts of auditors held joint reflections on cooperation in the audit of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany partly finances the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are the property of the Czech Road Construction Administration.</seg>
<seg id="58">There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The NA had no comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The NA Né also had to examine the effectiveness of the expenditure. To this end, the main technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels should be examined, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory negotiations, the Presidents of the two Courts of Auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of the audits of the Prague-Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="64">The auditors of both courts met in the course of 2006 at intervals of approximately six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">In doing so, they dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for auditing bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results on the construction of the border bridge and produced joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">The ongoing exchange of information was essential in the cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH was mainly concerned with the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKA mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs, and thus also in the way in which the two courts of auditors complete their audits.</seg>
<seg id="69">For this reason, both authorities prepared separate national reports on their audit results.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.</seg>
<seg id="74">They later postponed the date by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">RMD acted as the contractor for the construction project.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany co-finances the construction of bridges at 42.13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">Initially, the RMD provided for a prestressed concrete construction for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, however, RMD and its German partner agreed on the construction of a steel composite structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">They justified this decision by reducing the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had identified the steel composite structure as the more cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, this was due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite structure of only 397 m,</seg>
<seg id="83">in fact, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the procurement procedure, the RMD made serious errors,</seg>
<seg id="85">by insufficiently preparing the procurement documents and describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria inaccurately.</seg>
<seg id="86">These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the evaluation committee and the Director General of the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="87">A losing tenderer challenged the outcome of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation by the Czech Antitrust Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a result, the summer construction season following the supply review was lost in 2004 and the available total construction time was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in less time. This led to a significant increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="91">Among the measures offered were the double assembly of the superstructures, the modification of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the steel grade originally envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new steel grade – the higher cost of which the client alone bore around €4 million – made it possible to shorten the construction time planned for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the offer price of approx. € 18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further additions will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened construction time alone led to a price increase of around € 5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">The costs are currently around € 25.9 million net without price grouting (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both courts examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterized by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German adrena a71, A 38 and A 4 motorways, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A17.</seg>
<seg id="101">In preparing this part of the examination, it was important to define the price concept in detail.</seg>
<seg id="102">For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts agreed on detailed specifications, such as: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="103">(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany vary and may change), not to take into account the cost of special start-up measures, to use the Rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion. (29 CZK = 1 €).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of various types (steel concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.</seg>
<seg id="106">The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">Concrete bridges (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17) were by far the most common on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="108">The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The study showed that the m2 price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the square meter price.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see figures below).</seg>
<seg id="111">On the A 17 two bridges could be found, on the D 8 four bridges with significantly increased prices.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges were determined partly by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified based on the distance to the regression curve).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as a clue as to which bridges to focus on.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw definitive conclusions, the reasons for the respective high price must be determined on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id="115">This could be due, for example, to uneconomic administrative action, but also to the requirements for the protection of the environment or other legitimate reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the price of bridges and the length suggested that Czech concrete bridges were cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">This was also supported by lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">Two reasons for this were identified during joint discussions:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="122">This also allows medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.</seg>
<seg id="124">Orders of this size cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge constructions built is greater than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the NKA noted that the construction of bridges is determined long before construction begins,</seg>
<seg id="128">already when the RMD submits its application for planning approval.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this time, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, economic efficiency plays a minor role in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">Only a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would have made it possible to reach a definitive conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have exceeded the scope of that examination.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany did not reveal any significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The significant price differences may be the result of underdeveloped competition for tunnelling in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow generalconclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Economic efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden-Prague motorway</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The plan was to gradually extend the D8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">The section 0805 was to be built through the Bohemian Low Mountains in front of the border section 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic finances d8 under programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">In programme number 327 220 "Construction of the motorway D 8 Prague - Czech German border" defines two objectives:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">as a national objective: to improve the link between Prague and sti nad Labem;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.</seg>
<seg id="147">The programme provided for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Low Mountains to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of section 0807 close to the border in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The NKA noted that the planning approval decision had already been issued for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Low Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental groups have appealed against this decision.</seg>
<seg id="151">A final judgment is pending.</seg>
<seg id="152">In comparison with the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, it could therefore not be ruled out that the completion of section No 0805 could be delayed by several years.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of construction phase No.0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result, the construction of the section close to the border did not achieve the national objective of improving the link between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD carried out a cost-effectiveness study of section 0807 of the D 8 and section No.0805 by the Bohemian Low Mountains between 1999 and 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">As an investment cost, it set an investment cost of around €639 million for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the economic analysis (EIRR = internal rate of interest)</seg>
<seg id="158">Variant Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic in the northern part of the border section 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Traffic in the northern part of the border section 22 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic in the northern part of the border section 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The 2001 economic efficiency study was based on the assumption that the section close to the border and the section leading through the Bohemian low mountain range are interspersed at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the examination it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Low Mountains would not be opened on the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This reduces the above EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The costs of both sections as at 31 December 2005 amounted to € 897 million excluding VAT, which is 27.4% higher than in the 2001 economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="168">There is also a risk that section 0805 will have a different more complex process, which would affect the economic viability of the project.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway, with a daily traffic volume of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010, is economically justified. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22 940 cars per day.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Low Mountains estimates traffic volumes of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day in 2007. The project is then below the economic efficiency limit.</seg>
<seg id="171">A higher volume of traffic on the routes intended to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Low Mountains is likely to lead to congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the initial economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The abovementioned reduction in revenue and an increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D8 will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the section of the D 8 border is therefore uneconomical.</seg>
<seg id="174">Costs were also increased in the construction of the A 17, as in the construction of the two sections of the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment for the 1992 Federal Transport Route Plan, the Federal Ministry responsible for transport assumed investment costs of around € 320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">It thus established a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, the costs have increased to around € 670 million and the benefit/cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">Irrespective of the parallel tests carried out with the NCA between 2003 and 2005, the BRH had examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A17 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="179">It found that the authority responsible for the permit requested an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A17.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the course of the audit, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the Road Construction Administration of the excess fluidity of the landscape tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="181">This prevented €10 million in construction costs and €150,000 in annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">When examining the first section of the A17, the BRH found that the construction work was insufficiently prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">During the planning phase, the road construction administration refrained from detecting the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschen wall, as it was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was only when the tunnelling reached the wall that she made up for it.</seg>
<seg id="186">This showed that the rock was more weathered than was assumed in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">Extensive measures such as anchorages, injections and stone-fall protection nets for around €3.3 million were necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road construction administration not only borne the costs of additional, already necessary ice sials such as securing the Dölzschen wall, but also for those that would not have been necessary if the construction had been properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="189">This includes expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional induction of the drivage team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of the construction period (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million is not offset by any lasting added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to better exercise its supervision of major road construction measures.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, it should insist that road construction administrations introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of the cooperation for BRH and NNÉ The cooperation met the expectations of both courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both courts developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.</seg>
<seg id="196">The NA noted that the main structural parameters for the bridges, tunnels and roadway of the D 8 are no different from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of both courts of auditors involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience which will be useful in future audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Preface</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the Courts of Auditors have the power to audit all public finances.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration requires the Courts of Auditors to have the power to examine the collection of taxes as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) regards taxes as an important component of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thematic focus of the VI EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the Courts of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is particularly true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interlinked and interdependent, a situation may arise in which the national courts of auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the courts of auditors of other countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example may be the examination of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Cooperation between the authorities is necessary in the fight against such offences.</seg>
<seg id="12">Courts of auditors examining in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea for an audit of the SALES tax as well as the SYSTEM MIAS originated at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating courts had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the evaluation of the available information, we selected the examination items for the examination planning.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual countries (particularly the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only improve the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international information exchange.</seg>

<seg id="26">- -De The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the abovementioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to remedy them.</seg>
<seg id="28">The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("Na") and the Federal Court of Justice ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused on the review of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the tax administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared within the meaning of European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The period audited covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the 'exchange of information' priority under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission's 1925/2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary declarations.</seg>
<seg id="35">The audit also covered the legal situation of international bus and coach passenger transport and the comparison of statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">When comparing VAT administration systems in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is the exceeding of the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, for the purposes of VAT, the taxable person receives a tax number applicable only to domestic transactions.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German taxable person wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the issue of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="42">As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the transport service, insofar as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">Whereas in the Czech Republic taxpayers only have to file VAT returns for periods of taxation (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly)</seg>
<seg id="49">VAT pre-registration and a VAT annual declaration after the end of the calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="50">In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxable persons in Germany have to submit pre-sales VAT vat by electronic means.</seg>
<seg id="51">The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of czech tax management (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="52">4) Summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="53">While taxpayers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary declarations to the tax offices (FÄ), German taxpayers are required to submit the summary declarations to CLO2.</seg>
<seg id="54">Accordingly, the information from the Summary Notifications is available to the FADs in the Czech Republic as soon as they are submitted.</seg>
<seg id="55">The information from the summary reports is only available to Deutsche FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="56">In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="57">The monthly submission of summary messages would shorten the period between the time of turnover and the updating of MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="58">This would allow a timely examination of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor processing times.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German tax authorities have completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the prescribed period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German CLO constantly monitor the deadlines (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The NCA and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5th).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, the two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions between Czech and German tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="69">Of these, 31 cases were reviewed jointly by using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts as to the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The Courts of Auditors noted that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the FADs used the information obtained from the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="72">In such cases, taxable persons had either unlawfully claimed the exemption from VAT or had not identified the purchase of goods in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the FABs were unable to use the information obtained from the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be recovered due to differences in legislation in the two Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax authorities of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="76">A number of cases have been identified where taxpayers have shown inaccurate transactions in their summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in the MIAS were accordingly incorrect, so that the clerks (the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="79">Examination procedure in the CR</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II – "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Audit Divisions of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited posts were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadai, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Tinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The College of the NCA approved the findings of the audit on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Examination procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the traffic tax audit area and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase, the actual test began in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NCA, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files from the following FAWere were included in the audit:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich-Corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, discussions were held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">The results of the examination were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors</seg>
<seg id="95">Several meetings of representatives of both courts of auditors took place in the run-up to the parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organisation of the tax administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in the other country.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were identified for the parallel examinations: 1.</seg>
<seg id="100">Registration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of financial officials in the handling of requests for information and the verification of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. Risk management in the area of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="110">At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NCA and the BRH in December 2006, the two sides became familiar with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel audits already achieved.</seg>

<seg id="118">An entrepreneur with a legal registered office, Head of business or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 for the last 12 consecutive calendar months becomes liable to pay on the first day of the third month following the month in which it has crossed the threshold (Section 94 (1) of Law No 235/2004 Coll., on VAT; hereinafter referred to in Law No 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="119">The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.</seg>
<seg id="120">Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxpayer if the taxpayer has exceeded the application period for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides VATable services or vat-exempt services with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million but he fulfils other conditions set out in Law No 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="122">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the conditions set out in the law may voluntarily apply for vat registration.</seg>
<seg id="123">The registration procedure in accordance with Law No 337/1992 begins with the receipt of the registration application by the local tax official.</seg>
<seg id="124">Anyone wishing to register voluntarily for VAT must indicate in their application the cut-off date from which they apply for registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax official shall check the information provided by the trader, i.e. the completed application for registration with all the installations.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="127">Where the tax official has established, by means of a verification, that the trader fulfils the conditions for registration, he shall issue a written notice of registration and the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="128">In the decision, the tax official shall indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the assessment period for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">Assessment period is the calendar quarter; unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="130">If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">An entrepreneur whose turnover in the previous calendar year reached at least CZK 2,000,000 is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the tax official of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The issue of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.</seg>
<seg id="133">The taxable person must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the tax official, as well as in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law No 235/2004, concerning the production of tax documents)3.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or any other general identification sign to the extent that a special law so provides. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of Section 33 (12) of Law No 337/1992).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the trader has not fulfilled his obligation despite a request from the tax official, the local tax official must register him of his own motion.</seg>
<seg id="137">A decision on this shall also be issued to the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business receives a tax number for any tax type when he or she first registers.</seg>
<seg id="139">This also applies to registration as a vat payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">Pursuant to Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the obligation to register VAT, the taxable person may require that the taxable person pay up to 10% of the proceeds of the taxable transaction unlawfully without taxation, for the period from the date on which the trader should have been registered as a taxable person, until the date on which the taxable person was registered by the tax official's order (Section 98(1) of Law No 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount thus fixed is considered to be a tax payment within the meaning of Paragraph 98(3) of Law No 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a vatpayer may be deleted for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly on the grounds that turnover does not reach the registration threshold (Section 106 (1) of Law No 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="145">A taxable person may request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) cancellation of registration of its own motion (Section 106(7) of Law No 235/2004) if: (a) the taxable person has not provided any benefit for a period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax official of the reasons for this, (b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No 235/2004, (c) the previous taxable person has no longer fulfilled the conditions for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Taxable persons without legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and has neither its legal registered office, registered office nor permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, or a taxable alien who provides services in the Czech Republic and who, in accordance with Paragraph 108 of Law No 235/2004, is required to file a tax return and pay taxes for those services or supplies ("non-resident entrepreneur") with the provision of the service in question.</seg>
<seg id="148">He must submit an application for registration with the FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.</seg>
<seg id="149">In this application, it is obliged to comply with all VAT ID no. Specify.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the date of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 must register him retroactively, as he became liable to VAT under Law No 235/2004 on the date of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the case of retrospective registration, FA Prague 1 shall require the contractors concerned to provide proof (invoices or written explanations) for proof of performance.</seg>
<seg id="152">If a non-resident contractor applies for registration in the Czech Republic prior to the first performance of a service, FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the contract documents justifying the performance.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">Pursuant to Section 106 (9) of Law No 235/2004, the tax official is entitled to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on 31 January of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to submit tax declarations or declarations and to pay tax.</seg>
<seg id="155">The nATo's audit revealed that, in the event of a tax return being submitted by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the IA until 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of the registration, become known to the IA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident trader for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of taxpayers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In accordance with the provisions of the tax jurisdiction (Sections 137, 138 AO), each business must be registered with the municipality and/or the competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">This notification must be made no later than one month after the commencement of business.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality forwards the notification to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has been commenced but has not been notified, it may also register the taxpayer retroactively of its own motion.</seg>
<seg id="162">In Germany, taxable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register for Zwekke vat if they fulfil the requirements set out in Section 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the level of turnover achieved.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">Special FAIs are responsible for entrepreneurs established abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="167">As at 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; As of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.</seg>
<seg id="168">According to the findings of the BRH, these FEs with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new central or central Eastern European Member States of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed persons tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These (sham) self-employed persons do not fulfil the conditions for recognition as entrepreneurs specified in Paragraph 2 of the UStG, since they are usually dependent on a single contracting authority which determines their working time and the way in which they perform work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, the trader must complete a questionnaire from the competent IA and provide information on the company and the business carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a form binding on all FÄ in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the general control units.</seg>
<seg id="174">This form is used to provide a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer before a tax number is allocated.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible IA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the IA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control number.</seg>
<seg id="177">If a trader wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he or she needs a VAT ID in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="179">The VAT Id. is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxable person declares intra-Community supplies in his vat advance declarations or in his annual VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT Id. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur may be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he ceases to operate, but only after all tax transactions have been completed (assessment of all financial years) or (2) if the tax authorities determine that he no longer operates a business.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID no. the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In such cases, the FA Must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number in order to ensure that the VAT ID is valid there. can be terminated at this time.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the Value Added Tax Act (Section 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 € and 2. is unlikely to exceed the amount of 50,000 € in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they do not have to pay VAT, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small business owner may declare the non-application of Section 19 (1) of the UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration shall be binding for the following five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">He may then charge the vat and deduct the sales tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (Section 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The condition for this is that they exclusively make tax-free transactions and waive the deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that the foreign entrepreneur does not have to register for vat purposes.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices shall indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the exceeding of the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences may occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the event of its registration for VAT, this tax number shall also apply to intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically allocate an VAT ID. Request.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both the NCP and the BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which provides a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions, can lead to significant misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business activity with the municipality or the competent IA.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retrospective registration allows for an accurate assessment of VAT for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As the different registration procedures create problems, the rules should be harmonised throughout the EC.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.</seg>
<seg id="208">This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxes to every natural person after birth.</seg>
<seg id="209">This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person takes up a business activity, the competent IA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which is as VAT ID. Serves.</seg>
<seg id="211">In future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of VAT ID no. To give.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers is still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="213">Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach</seg>
<seg id="214">The legal regulations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">Pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 70 of Law No 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="216">The exemption from VAT shall also apply where the transport of persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners liable to tax in the country is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return journey is considered to be a separate transport operation.</seg>
<seg id="218">If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic carry out no economic activity other than the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT liability under the law on the accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The above-mentioned passage states in the text:</seg>
<seg id="220">'For the purpose of applying Article 28(3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28(4) of the Directive is fulfilled or as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States.'</seg>
<seg id="221">The legal regulations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Paragraph 3b(1) of the UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.</seg>
<seg id="223">Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the part of the transport service attributable to the domestic territory is taxable in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxable person transits through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany shall be deemed to be a taxable transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before providing his services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent IA.</seg>
<seg id="228">The latter registers it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus and coach mentioned in the taxpayer's declaration.</seg>
<seg id="229">The trader must declare his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport service is provided for a domestic ally, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the IA.</seg>
<seg id="232">In its place, the domestic customer of the services must pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is known as the 'transfer of tax liability' and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the notification by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile control groups of customs check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for the carriage of passengers through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each inspection, the mobile control groups shall submit an inspection report to the competent IA.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident taxable person may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax liability indicated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the FA has doubts as to the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the IA or may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the foreign taxable person refuses to pay the value added tax lawfully fixed, the IA may request assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters to verify the VAT return or the observance of tax liability by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the low revenue from VAT on taxable passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the examination of the accounts of a non-resident taxpayer imposes disproportionate costs on the taxpayer himself and on the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter must check the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.</seg>
<seg id="243">Accordingly, such an examination is likely to take more time than a resident taxpayer, although the examination is limited to passenger transport taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit ingesenities of his national tax administration, but also those of the other Member States in so far as he carries out passenger transport there.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, for each Member State in which only a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxable person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the tax administrations of the EC Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="246">Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation varies between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic's law on the accession of the Czech Republic exempts the movement of passengers between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the route of transport to German territory.</seg>
<seg id="251">If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent IA in advance.</seg>
<seg id="252">This registers the taxable person who has to declare the taxable portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd have the carriage of passengers as their business purpose.</seg>
<seg id="255">The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States – which levy VAT under Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system – have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of vat assessment, cross-border passenger transport should be taxable only in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the State in which the transport begins or in which the service provider is established.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">Unless otherwise provided by law, the trader is obliged to file a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period, even if no tax liability has arisen.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax liability arises at the end of the deadline for filing the VAT return. The exception to this scheme is VAT on imports of goods, in accordance with Law No 235/2004. Here, the due date of the tax is determined in accordance with customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If, as a result, above-average deductible input taxes result in a refund entitlement, that amount shall be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the date on which that deduction has been fixed, without any application having to be made.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit shall not be applied in cases where the tax official initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="266">Pursuant to Paragraph 73 (11) of Law No 235/2004, the right to deduct can be asserted no later than the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct arose.</seg>
<seg id="267">After the expiry of that period, the deduction of input VAT may still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this requires the submission of a supplementary vat return.</seg>
<seg id="269">An amendment to Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct could have been asserted for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">A taxable person must submit a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, (b) he makes adjustments which do not alter the last known tax liability but only changes previous information, c) he makes adjustments to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with Paragraph 49 of Law No 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">A taxable person may file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxable person must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.</seg>
<seg id="273">The VAT return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or via data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="274">The submission via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.</seg>
<seg id="275">If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to data carriers.</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return form contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="277">The value of related services must be indicated in separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered as taxable there is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary declarations.</seg>
<seg id="280">The value of the purchases of goods from persons registered as taxable by other Member States is compared with the information in the summary declarations of taxpayers from other EC Member States by means of the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="281">Under the ATIS system, the FA is audited for the credibility of THE VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="282">This is done automatically, because the VAT return cannot be processed without the previous audit.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility check includes a calculation of the criteria for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">Pursuant to Section 37 (1) of Law No 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this Act.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system – Automated tax information system used by czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="286">In its examination, the NCA found that the FAWas seldom made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person concerned in the event of non-submission of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly vat pre-registrations and the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit vat pre-declarations must nevertheless submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small business owners who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="291">In principle, taxpayers are obliged to submit a VAT advance declaration by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is generated (Section 18 (2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT debt exceeds € 6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly established company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxable person may also decide to submit monthly pre-sales VAT declarations if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (Section 18 (2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">If the annual sales tax does not exceed € 512, no pre-sales VAT or VAT returns are to be entered.</seg>
<seg id="295">A resulting VAT liability must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="296">A refund may result in a more thorough audit by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="297">(Legal) There are no deadlines for processing VAT returns and for reimbursing VAT overpayments.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.</seg>
<seg id="299">In principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German Value Added Tax Act allows an extension of these (tax or payment) deadlines (Section 18 (6) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">The extension of the time limit must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">If granted, the VAT advance declarations and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment must be made.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment shall be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period of December.</seg>
<seg id="304">If an error is detected, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT advance declaration.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no "supplementary" VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the trader can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corrections to this VAT return on the taxable person's tax or disadvantage are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was made.</seg>
<seg id="308">At the end of this four-year period, a VAT return can normally only be corrected in cases of reckless tax reduction or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Taxpayers must submit pre-vat pre-registrations electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">THE FEUs may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unreasonable hardening.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual VAT return can be submitted either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If the tax is made without certification, the taxpayer must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">If no VAT advance declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxable person6.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of a late payment, the taxpayer may be subject to a late payment surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of € 25,000).</seg>
<seg id="315">In an earlier examination, the BRH found that THE FAIs often do not charge this late payment surcharge.</seg>
<seg id="316">In cases where the FA levies the late payment surcharges, the amount was fixed inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The late payment surcharge therefore fails to have its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular when submitting the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The vat return form contains separate lines for the value of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions shall be indicated in a separate line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="321">The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or recorded electronically by specially designated personnel.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data of electronically submitted tax returns are immediately available to the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="323">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="324">After all data is collected electronically, they are subject to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.</seg>
<seg id="325">The VAT returns thus selected must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically generated inspection notes (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, taxable persons must submit their advance declarations no later than 10 days, either after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annual VAT statement must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to file an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ At the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer may correct the errors in the monthly advance declarations by submitting a single VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">– if the taxable person corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;</seg>
<seg id="335">– The Länder do not match MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the annual VAT declarations have been processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation to pay enables the German tax authorities to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small business owners.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the competent IA may compare the annual VAT statement with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company concerned.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can only verify the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return submitted.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are obliged to make the VAT advance declaration electronically.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to file a tax return electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary messages</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">Pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 102 of Law No 235/2004, a trader supplying goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State must submit corresponding summary declarations (zm).</seg>
<seg id="345">The value of the goods delivered is always given in Czech currency in the ZM, broken down by VAT ID7, the individual taxable person under which they are registered in the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="346">Information on services is not provided in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="347">Taxable persons with a monthly or quarterly tax period shall submit the ZM to the local competent IA no later than the 25th day following the end of each quarter.</seg>
<seg id="348">Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the error being found.</seg>
<seg id="349">Incorrect data in the ZM are always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similar to tax returns, taxpayers can also submit the ZM electronically.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a taxable person does not surrender a ZM or an amending ZM, even though he is obliged to do so under Law No 235/2004, the tax official must ask him to surrender the Relevant ZM, thereby referring him to the consequences of non-levying. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the tax official is entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Paragraph 37 of Law No 337/1992.</seg>
<seg id="352">In its examination, the NCA found that THE FA usually did not use its power to impose fines on its defaulting taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, in the case of the levy on the ZM, the taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to surrender a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">Pursuant to Paragraph 102(5) of Law No 235/2004, the tax official is obliged to verify the information in the ZM or Correction SEM, to remove any ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In case of non-conformity</seg>

<seg id="358">– the taxable person does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or Correction-ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting an amending ZM,</seg>
<seg id="359">– the tax official has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxable person in the ZM or Correction ZM.</seg>
<seg id="360">The corrections entered by the tax official without an amending ZM on the part of the taxpayer do not replace the taxpayer's obligation to submit an adjustment, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">Data from the SM are forwarded to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only the national tax authority referred to for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT may transmit and receive such data.</seg>
<seg id="363">This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The "O_MCTL" message is automatically sent to the CLO from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect VAT ID no. specified in the submitted ZM lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">Will the incorrect VAT ID. in some of the submitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry in the list of the wrong VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="366">The list contains a 'Notification of doubts concerning VAT ID No.'.</seg>
<seg id="367">The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the verification into the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase on the lines of the VAT return intended for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of differences between the values of the acquisitions made by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return and the values of the goods reported by the supplier from the other Member State in its ZM shall be forwarded by the CLO to the competent IA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="370">The relevant officers there must investigate the discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="371">There are then three different situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">(a) the value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of supplies indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax official shall verify the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The difference amount is zero.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation may arise either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or by a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxable person in the meantime, on his own initiative, issues a supplementary VAT return).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax official to verify the accuracy of the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="377">(c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return, is higher than the value of their deliveries of goods reported by suppliers of the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="378">In this case, it is again at the discretion of the tax official to verify the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="379">After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer shall enter the results of his review in ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">These results are forwarded to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination is shown in Figure 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance) for each quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="382">Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, inter alia, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">Differences between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be due to an error on the part of the domestic purchaser.</seg>
<seg id="385">There may also be an error on the part of the taxable person in another Member State or an error caused by the different types of supplies in the CMR in each EC Member State.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for discrepancies in the value of reported transactions found in the audited FIs are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary notifications in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community supplies from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly To ZM, which lists intra-Community supplies by purchaser (Section 18a (1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="390">If a permanent extension is granted for the submission of vat pre-registrations, this also applies to the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="391">The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="393">The competent IA may allow exemptions for individual taxpayers in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">If the taxable person finds that the ZM was defective, he is obliged to submit an amending ZM within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In the event of non-submission of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="396">This includes the following steps: - first memory - second memory, combined with the threat that a penalty payment will be imposed and - setting the penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows the setting of a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (Section 329 AO), the CLO imposes penalty payments of €125, €250 and €500 in three stages.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, Paragraph 26a (1) No 5 UStG provides that the taxable person acts in an irregular manner if he intentionally or recklessly does not hand over a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.</seg>
<seg id="399">This infringement can be punished with a fine of up to €5,000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the FUs, because the CLO is solely responsible for processing the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="401">The data of the ZM is stored only at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="402">The data from the summary messages are only available to the FA after they have been processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).</seg>
<seg id="405">In case of incorrect VAT ID. in the ZM of German taxable persons, the German CLO receives a notification "O_MCTL" from the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to him to request the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="409">In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs had the VAT Id. corrected at the request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the reminder, threat and setting of up to three consecutive periodic penalty payments takes too much time if a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">The cases that were ultimately reported to the competent FIA were usually closed within one to two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The competent IA refused to exempt the declared intra-Community supplies in 73% of these cases9.</seg>
<seg id="413">If the taxable person provided the correct VAT ID. the FA asked him to hand over a corrected ZM to the CLO because the FA cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the surrender of the corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="415">As a result, taxpayers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of VAT returns, the information on deliveries of goods made in the VAT pre-declarations or VAT returns shall not be compared with the corresponding information in the CMR before such data are forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This comparison can only be done by the FIs. This is usually done when preparing a special VAT check.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data received from other Member States are processed at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT ID. recognised and reported to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data are used for the control of the taxation of acquisitions in the FEEc.</seg>
<seg id="420">As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with the data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control communications shall be drawn up and sent to the competent FAE.</seg>
<seg id="422">This is done continuously, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all VAT taxpayers is later compiled and forwarded to the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="423">The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares this data with those relating to intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">The system fully (only) checks those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community supplies to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must, within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter, submit a ZM to the local FA.</seg>
<seg id="427">The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of intra-Community supplies declared by the taxable persons in the SMr shall be compared with the values of intra-Community supplies reported by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison will be taken into account in the tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community supplies are obliged to submit quarterly SMwithins within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.</seg>
<seg id="431">Since 1 January 2007, taxpayers have had to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="432">The data from the ZM are only available to the CIs after their processing at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">In both the Czech Republic and Germany, taxable persons only indicate deliveries of goods in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="434">The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FUS, the German FADs cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the Submitted ZM themselves.</seg>
<seg id="435">Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID no. not corrected even if the taxable person has the correct VAT ID. the FA.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax authorities do not compare the information on intra-Community supplies made by German taxable persons in their pre-sales VAT declarations with the information provided by the relevant ZM.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of the pre-notification and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">On the basis of these findings of the BRH, it is clear that a comparison would improve the reliability of the TRANSMITTEd MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="439">The data on the supply of goods to Czech taxpayers transmitted by other Member States are compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchases of goods indicated by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The Czech CLO shall make the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most serious cases of deviations are sent to the FÄ for examination.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general check shall be carried out only in the case of taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct input VAT.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax authorities only control the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxpayers if the RMS has drawn up an inspection notice or if the taxable person has already been selected for an audit.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the FÄ of clarifying the reasons for differences that arise.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information which may well be six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to hand over monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly levy would only significantly increase the bureaucratic burden, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are in any case obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or pre-registrations and the ZM does not require more information than for VAT returns or advance declarations.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid red tape, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the submission of VAT returns or advance declarations.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, an obligation to levy ZM on a monthly level would create more periodic discrepancies between information on intra-Community supplies and those relating to intra-Community purchases and would increase the flow of data between the CloTs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="454">The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In order for the obligation to pay A CMR on a monthly date to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of MIAS data is possible.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both courts requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID. in the O_MCTL notifications exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter audited.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data can be found in the tables below.</seg>
<seg id="462">They have significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O_MCTLMeldung received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information at level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information enables financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxable persons who exported them.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003), distinguishes between two basic ways of exchanging information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request is made by requestfor information RFI using the standardised SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="470">The financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their replies to a received RFI through the Financial Directorate to the CLO. The latter shall arrange for the translation into the foreign language of the information provided in the standardised SCAC form and the transmission to the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It shall arrange for their translation into Czech and their distribution to the relevant FAFor processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period under review were audited by the NFI.</seg>
<seg id="474">Out of the total of 94 RIS received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) has exceeded this processing period.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NCA had examined it. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Graph 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">Out of the total of 335 requests for information (RIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) were made. a reply within the three-month period; another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were dealt with after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases no reply had yet been received from Germany to the examination by the NCA (in the remaining one case it could not be determined, on the basis of the information stated, when Germany replied to the request for information).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the time limits within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Figure No 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of intra-Community turnover figures shown in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Graph 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information were usually worth more than €60,000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Financial officials of other Member States are often provided with information, without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected from the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The exchange of information between the member states takes place electronically.</seg>
<seg id="484">'Automatic exchange' in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of predetermined information to other Member States at regular, predetermined intervals without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="485">'Structured automatic exchange' means the systematic transmission of predetermined information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States of the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is obtained by the tax official from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law No 235/2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data into the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. According to that provision, such data shall be transmitted to the other Member States within the prescribed period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Czech Republic also provides the other Member States with information on mail order transactions which are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions which appear to be inadmissible and on potential 'missing traders'.</seg>
<seg id="490">This information shall be communicated to the other Member States by means of an SCAC form in the spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local FA.</seg>
<seg id="493">The FAEsends send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The FAIs are instructed to submit their requests for information or spontaneous information only on German, even the SCAC form used is a single one.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure the taxation of acquisitions in the other Member State or to prove the exemption from intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall verify whether the value of the supplies referred to in the request exceeds the minimum amount of € 15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a transaction that is below the minimum amount limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO shall arrange for the translation of the freely formulated texts in The SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are not written in German or in English.</seg>
<seg id="499">In order to respond to the request for information, the CLO forwards this to the competent FA, referring to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary staffing capacity to remind the FÄ to reply to the unfinished requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The FA Is tased to obtain the necessary information by writing to the taxpayer or carrying out an external audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">External auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.</seg>
<seg id="504">In this short and flexible form of audit, an announcement to the taxpayer is not required and it has proved its worth in examining a single transaction.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the automatic exchange of information, Germany shall provide the other Member State with the following information: via VAT ID no., allocated to companies established in other EC Member States, on the refund of vat to traders established in other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC Member States in the context of the structured automatic exchange of information:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. The supply of new vehicles to contractors without VAT, b. distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the acquisitions reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community supplies of goods which have been incorrectly taxed by the taxable person in Germany, e. potential 'missing traders' , regardless of whether their VAT No. is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have an VAT ID. have misused.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information is made in the Czech Republic as well as in Germany on the initiative of the local COMPETENT FA, which transmits the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information provided into English or German, the German FADs follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in german.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">In examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005, the NKO found that the Czech tax authorities completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were dealt with by the German tax authorities only in 40.6% of cases within that period.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO draws the FÄ's attention to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.</seg>
<seg id="514">Due to the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of requests for information that have been answered within a time limit.</seg>
<seg id="515">For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has now changed.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at various levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of VAT or its Risk Management Unit is concerned with identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluating trends in these risks in national and intra-Community trade.</seg>
<seg id="523">At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, conceptually prepares risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States in this area.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides, inter alia, for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the MIAS system, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.</seg>

<seg id="529">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="530">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="531">The Tax Audit and Audit Methodology Division carries out risk analyses in the context of methodical management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the tax authorities and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Tax investigation agencies exist with the financial directorates. Its tasks include finding taxpayers and sectors at risk in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. internet business, gold, pharmaceutical industry), finding unregistered taxpayers (e.g. in the internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.) sectors, investigating links in chain fraud cases and informing local financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected FATs.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local competence of the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up the special audit units stems from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.</seg>
<seg id="536">These special units check in accordance with the needs of tax investigators or focus on taxpayers with certain activities, multinationals and taxpayers with particularly high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: – the 'credibility of VAT return' task to assess the risk of tax returns, the 'selection of taxpayers to be audited', selecting the taxpayers to be audited on the basis of certain criteria, the 'MIAS' task, which gives tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The "MIAS" task allows, among other things: - Verification of the validity of the VAT ID. of taxable persons from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxable person concerned from other Member States, — drawing up a list of taxable persons who have not submitted ZM , formal control of the information provided by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their ZM before such information is transmitted to other Member States , — drawing up a list of taxable persons whose VAT returns do not match the information on deliveries of goods to other Member States with the information in the CMR, — drawing up a list of taxable persons whose VAT returns do not match the information on the value of goods purchased from other Member States with the information in the ZM of all their suppliers from other Member States13.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their role in the fight against tax evasion, tax officials have access to the data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registry offices, motor vehicle registers, business registers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Because of their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (especially the CLO) and the tax administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of the Länder have a complete set of data.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the CLO, Unit ST I 2 (the "KUSS" - Coordination Centre for Special VAT Audits and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.</seg>
<seg id="545">In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or sales tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="546">KusS coordinates related cases of VAT fraud at national level as well as cases of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experience of the KUSS is brought to the development of the RMS through its cooperation in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.</seg>
<seg id="549">The formal review of the composition of VAT No. other Member States appearing in the ZM of German taxpayers is carried out at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal review is carried out before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The verification of validity in the VAT ID. is based on the O_MCTL identifiers provided by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the CLO's RMS relies on MIAS data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of communications to detect suspected missing traders. As a guide, certain characteristics are used, which usually occur in carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="553">The FEDERAL states are instructed to process these communications and must forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.</seg>
<seg id="554">The audit carried out by the BRH confirmed that all available characteristics must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability of a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).</seg>
<seg id="555">Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different indications in the preparation of the communications.</seg>
<seg id="556">The risk management system should also take into account other factors, such as the taxpayer's payment behaviour, the economic sector or the company's shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of risk management is in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of pre-sales VAT and annual declarations.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the system draws up a list of taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community supplies in their VAT advance declaration or annual declaration.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO for monitoring the complete submission of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions reported by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the Länder avoid comparing the quarterly data, as these would reveal too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; Such as.:</seg>
<seg id="562">– the supplier and the purchaser assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community turnover;</seg>
<seg id="563">– different accounting registration and tax declarations of discounts and rebates.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing the data from VAT returns with MIAS data, many Länder have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of holders/partners, number of employees and payment method of the taxpayer).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out.</seg>
<seg id="566">This system is used when processing vat advance declarations by the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="567">This provides the competent IA with the information provided by the RMS before the VAT is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers must adjust the rules according to the feedback from the FEs.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on data from detected cases of evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list, the competent FATs shall decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it has proposed.</seg>
<seg id="574">In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called the data mining system) calculates how likely it is that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax cheats.</seg>
<seg id="577">On the basis of this list, the FADs shall select the taxable persons concerned for examination and report the results of the audit to the data centre concerned.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether the expected effects will be applied during actual use.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech and Germany, the NCP and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud, in particular carousel fraud, has proved to be not a national problem, but a European one.</seg>
<seg id="586">The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State, but in several Member States.</seg>
<seg id="587">A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this is not done, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="589">The tax losses caused by VAT fraud across Europe do not necessarily concern the Member State in which the initiator is established.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">There should therefore be an exchange of European experience on the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel audits, the NA and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and</seg>
<seg id="593">Acquired which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two courts jointly examined the settlement of several supplies which there were doubts about their implementation or which the taxable persons of both States explained differently in their tax returns or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, the NCA examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, in 43 cases, the NCP examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxpayers had indicated in their tax returns and ZM, on the basis of notifications from the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the NCA, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="598">The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems referred to in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased €60,500 worth of goods from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech taxable person declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech Tax Administration sent a request for information to Germany to verify the value of the goods delivered.</seg>
<seg id="603">In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 worth of goods in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="604">It also emerged from the reply that the VAT IdNo. german taxable person was not valid until 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further request from the German taxable person and the validity of the VAT ID no. withretroactive effect from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this information, it was an (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="607">By means of a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKA found that in 2004 the Czech taxable person had submitted additional VAT returns for each (under year) tax period, during which he declared a higher value of the acquisitions from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from acquisitions from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared acquisitions also included the value of the supplies of the above-- German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="609">In response to a request for information from the NCA, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">At the time of registration, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only for a tax number which finally applied to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively provide a VAT id to a taxable person. in 2006, the responsible clerk of the German tax administration did so retroactively as of 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO shares a USt Id No. retrospectively if the German trader has not caused the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO accepts the delay following the taxpayer's request for the issue of a VAT ID. Caused.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO issues the VAT Id. retrospectively, because the entrepreneur does not have a valid VAT ID for an intra-Community delivery in accordance with Paragraph 6 of the UStG. Required.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) VAT ID. of its supplier in order to explain the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted the VAT Id No. retroactive in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">In the context of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested a review of the German entrepreneur's VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="618">The MIAS data show the date of registration of 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">In their reply, the German authorities stated that the German taxable person had been registered on 1 October 2004, but that, for organisational reasons, it was not until 16 February 2005 that a VAT ID was registered in Germany. to be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="620">By enquiry from the czech tax official responsible locally, the NKA was informed that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit with the Czech taxable person for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">In that examination, the Tax Office found that the Czech taxable person had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 that he had provided to the German taxable person before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">The (Czech) tax office fixed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 to the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="623">In response to the nANé's request, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had the VAT id. only when he registered his company, which was set up in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the FaE registered it retroactively from 1 October 20045 for VAT purposes in order to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In that VAT return, the taxable person stated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approximately CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In his VAT return for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="627">When reviewing the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that that registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the deliveries of goods to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech taxable person issued a supplementary VAT return in which he declared transactions from domestic supplies worth CZK 114,615 and VAT of CZK 21,777 which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">By a request to the local IA in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person subsequently made an application for a resumption of the tax procedure in the case of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Accordingly, the Czech tax official verified the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">It was apparent from the German information that the German taxable person had not received an VAT id until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods. had been allocated.</seg>
<seg id="632">Consequently, the Czech tax official dismissed the request for a resumption of the tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH found that, in this case, no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place because the German taxable person had only been subject to an VAT Id. had received.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the VAT on it and also requested the reimbursement of sales taxes of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">Since this did not lead to a change in the amount of the Tax Liability of the German Taxable Person, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">The BRH also found that the German taxpayer's company referred to in the request for information was amended during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="637">This name change at the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax official.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official verified the purchase of goods by a Czech taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005 from a German taxpayer worth €22,686.</seg>
<seg id="640">By means of a request from the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NNÉ found that, during an external inspection with the Czech taxpayer, the Czech tax official had examined whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech taxable person did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return because the German supplier did not declare its VAT ID in the invoice. but only indicated its tax number intended for transactions within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">According to MIAS data, the German taxable person will not be registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax authorities send a copy of the German taxpayer's registration certificate so that he could initiate a corresponding tax procedure if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose VAT on the purchase of the goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH found that, under German law, a taxable person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have an VAT ID. for intra-Community supplies in order to benefit from the VAT exemption for such a supply.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier only has to use the VAT No. the transferee in the other Member State and can document the transport of the goods concerned to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">In this case, under German tax law, the transaction is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply which should be subject to the taxation of acquisitions in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any event, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this transaction, because the supply of a machine of this value was not part of the german supplier's core business.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount limit of € 15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the context of intergovernmental administrative assistance, the Czech tax administration requested, by means of an SCAC form, the examination of this delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech taxable person stated that he had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax authorities rejected the request for the transmission of supporting documents – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – on the ground that the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other reasoning had been given.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documents for ex post taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax determination was valid.</seg>
<seg id="656">In response to a request from the NCA, the BRH found that the German taxable person acted as a 'fiscal representative17' (Section 22 (a) – (e) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German taxable person explained those supplies in his VAT return and in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to exemption was recognised.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents necessary for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">Section 4.6.1 showed that the responses of the German tax administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than those received by the Czech tax administration:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. In its audit, the NCA found that, on 5 October 2005, the Czech tax authorities had submitted a request for information on the value of the goods delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person worth €86,307; however, for the same period, the Czech taxable person declared in his VAT return only the purchase of goods worth €35,314.</seg>
<seg id="663">In its reply to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing time specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed since the German undertaking had been dissolved at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, that a review of a supply of motor vehicles to a German taxable person worth € 1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The NCA noted that a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received at the time of its examination.</seg>
<seg id="667">By means of a request from the local tax official, the NNÉ found that the Czech taxable person had not declared in his VAT return the supply of new motor vehicles to that German taxable person worth CZK 11,816,103.</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer issued a corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="669">Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all the vehicles concerned had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were resold to other taxable persons in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="672">However, the Czech taxable person did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="673">By enquiry to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that the Czech taxpayer had not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Czech taxpayer did not file any tax returns even after being requested by the tax official. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine that supply from the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech taxable person did not cooperate with the tax official, the latter sent a request for information on the above-mentioned supply to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the reply to the request for information was not received until 7 February 2007, it was not known, until the conclusion of the nC's examination, how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="678">Due to non-compliance with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because, at the time of the nA And GH's audit, the competent IA had not yet completed the external audit:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, that a review of a supply of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004 be carried out for a value of €16,991, with evidence of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he had only received the invoices issued by the Czech authorities for deliveries worth €16,335.</seg>
<seg id="683">On the basis of the nANé's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German purchaser doubled the purchase of €16,335 worth of goods in its pre-sales VAT declarations for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, that the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 be reviewed, with evidence of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax authorities sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxable person had purchased several motor vehicles and that, moreover, the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">The NCA found that the local iA had carried out several external audits with the Czech taxpayer in order to verify the deduction of above-average input taxes.</seg>
<seg id="688">However, an unjustified claim was not established.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that, for the period in question, the German taxable person had declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States for a total value of €579,114 and that the examination of the German IA with the purchaser in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information contained in the supplier's ZM.</seg>
<seg id="691">In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistencies18 or the incorrect declaration of a transaction as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to data from MIAS, the Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005; however, the Czech taxpayer did not declare that acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech taxable person did not cooperate with the tax official and no business was carried out at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech tax official requested, in the context of the international exchange of information, how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech.</seg>
<seg id="695">The German reply to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German tax authorities, the Czech taxable person was unknown at the address indicated and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarder.</seg>
<seg id="696">The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth €21,659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech taxable person sent the German taxpayer a false payment confirmation for the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After the czech purchaser's fraudulent conduct was revealed, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, was able to recover the material supplied, with the exception of one part worth €7,916.</seg>
<seg id="699">In a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NCA found that, on the basis of the information received to the Czech taxpayer, the tax authorities subsequently taxed, inter alia, the turnover tax on deliveries of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.</seg>
<seg id="700">On the basis of a request from the NCA, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth €7,916 after corrections.</seg>
<seg id="701">In accordance with German legislation, the German taxable person declared that the supply would be reversed and that the tax base would be reduced in the quarter of the reversal.</seg>
<seg id="702">Its ZM contained the following information concerning Czech taxpayers:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax administration requested, by means of an SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxable person had supplied the German taxable person with goods with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The NCA found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit of the Czech taxpayer in order to investigate that supply.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the request for information, the Czech tax authorities stated that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and assembled a production plant to the German company.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech taxable person supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic's accession to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German taxable person did not take the assembled production plant and claimed defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German taxpayer received the restraining powers, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">By enquiry from the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKA found that all the invoices had been duly recorded in the czech taxpayer's accounts.</seg>
<seg id="713">The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only those amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and relating to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply from the Czech tax authorities, the local IAEa concluded that these transactions constituted a single (goods) supply by the Czech taxpayer to the German assembly, including the assembly carried out.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German recipient of the work is liable for the value added tax in accordance with the German Value Added Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient may claim a deduction of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">Since the German taxable person's liability for turnover remained unchanged, the German FA did not correct the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to MIAS data, Czech taxable person A purchased a €58,000 machine from the German taxable person C.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany for verification of this information.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person C supplied that machine to the Czech taxable person B in 2004, but that it had been returned to the German taxable person C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German taxable person C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">It was also apparent from the reply to the request for information that the German taxable person C had supplied the machine to the Czech taxable person A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">The latter received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's branch in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since this delivery (from C to A) was made only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">By enquiry from the tax official responsible for taxable person B, the NNÉ found that, according to MIAS data, the German taxable person C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">Taxable person B stated that he had not received the goods and that the Czech tax official responsible locally sent a request for information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">The answer was that the machine had been delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">In the course of further investigations into taxable person B, the tax official found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been registered with taxable person B and that it could be the same type of machine as that supplied to Czech taxable person A by the branch of the German taxable person C in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The NCA also found that the Czech tax official responsible for taxable person A had carried out an audit of the taxable person A.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax official had the invoice of the German taxable person C of 7 February 2005, in which the taxable person A is to be indicated as the recipient of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax official found that taxable person A had not entered that invoice.</seg>
<seg id="733">Taxable Person A had concluded a leasing contract with another Czech company, the object of which was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also provided transport.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxable person A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH found that the German taxable person C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic but to another German taxable person, D.</seg>
<seg id="737">Accordingly, there was no intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the claim of the German taxable person C for VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German taxable person D supplied the machine to the Czech taxable person B.</seg>
<seg id="740">Under German law, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">The BRH also found that the German taxable person C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech taxpayer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German IA.</seg>
<seg id="743">The figure below shows the contractual relations between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">During the examination of requests for information received, the NNÉ found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax authorities had received a request for information from Germany in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community supplies by a German taxable person worth €879,680,625 to a Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="746">The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The German taxable person had not carried on any active business activity since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The NCA found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="749">The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim by the German taxpayer against the German tax authorities, which the Czech taxable person had claimed as a shareholder in the German company with the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided to the NCA, the Czech tax official has so far had no information that the German tax authorities are handling the case with regard to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is clear from the information available that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community supply of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to indicate intra-Community acquisition in the recipients' tax returns (see section 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to MIAS data, a German taxable person supplied goods totalling €33,205 to a Czech taxable person between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="754">However, the Czech taxable person did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany in the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In its reply to that request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxable person and that the latter had personally collected the other goods.</seg>
<seg id="757">By enquiry from the local Czech financial officer, the NNÉ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="758">Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="759">This check has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to MIAS data, a German taxable person had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, a Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for a review of the actual value of the supply.</seg>
<seg id="763">The German reply to this request sent three invoices which showed a total value of € 31,999 for the delivered goods, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="764">By enquiry from the Czech tax official responsible locally, the NNÉ found that, after receiving the reply from Germany, the latter had contacted the czech taxpayer's accountant and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to discuss with the company owner the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">So far, no additional VAT return has been received.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax official informed the NCA that it would act in such a way as to respect the deadlines for retroactive VAT fixing for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxable person delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="769">In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for an overview as to whether the Czech taxpayer in point actually existed, since the alleged owner of the German taxable company had set up a number of bogus companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">In the course of the review of the operation by the IA, the Czech taxable person confirmed the purchase of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech taxpayer, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but resold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech taxpayer provided evidence of the sale in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech taxable person was not registered as liable for VAT in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official provided this information to the German tax administration in his reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="775">By enquiry from the Czech tax official responsible locally, the NNÉ found that, on the basis of a tax audit carried out, the Czech taxable person had submitted a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he declared, inter alia, the value of the goods acquired by a German taxable person and, at the same time, asserted the right to deduct input VAT for the acquisition from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">In his Czech VAT return, he did not report VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="777">On the basis of a supplementary VAT return, which had been submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT debt unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">Under Czech legislation, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case, as the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">Thus, the Czech tax official has drawn a false conclusion in the external audit.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH found that, immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the Taxable Person's tax return and requested payment of VAT worth €1,600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent IA sent a control notice to the IA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of those goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community deliveries which may not have been carried out:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax authorities on whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The request for information was accompanied by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="786">A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was also attached.</seg>
<seg id="787">In the course of his investigation, the Czech finance official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named therein had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and that he had no contact with a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="789">With this information, the Czech finance official replied to the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.</seg>
<seg id="790">By enquiry from the czech tax official responsible locally, the NNÉ found that the Czech taxpayer did not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company was not reachable.</seg>
<seg id="791">Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period february 2005, the Czech tax official set the Tax Liability of the Czech Taxpayer at zero.</seg>
<seg id="792">In the course of a further investigation, the Czech financial official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="793">The BRH found that the German tax official responsible locally had rejected the German taxable person's right to exemption from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. In the course of an external audit, a German IAI was not in a position to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased as indicated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="795">A Czech taxpayer was alleged to have delivered €89,424 worth of goods to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German taxable person did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested, in the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, that the supplies be checked and their payment.</seg>
<seg id="797">In his reply to the request for information, the Czech finance official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was allegedly a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech taxable person issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by a person not authorised to do so, namely that shareholder of the undertaking, after the managing director had been deleted from the commercial register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The czech taxpayer's accountant informed the tax official that the owner of the capital had paid the payment in euros received for the invoiced goods into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash receipts have not been issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">By enquiry to the local competent Czech FA, the NKA found that the tax official had recognised the Czech taxable person's right to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the German purchaser's VAT return, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the previous external audit did not show any evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to MIAS data, in 2005 a German taxable person purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">The German taxable person did not declare intra-Community acquisitions in either his 2004 VAT return or the 2005 VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, it did not declare any initial sales in terms of value.</seg>
<seg id="808">As a result of these discrepancies, the German FA made a request for information concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods totalling CZK 167,246,083.</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to examine whether the supply reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In its reply to that request for information, the Czech tax authorities stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).</seg>
<seg id="812">It is apparent from the documents provided to the NCA by the competent tax official that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer, a protocol had been drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the commencement of the turnover assessment for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the taxable person was asked by the tax official to provide all accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the need for a new managing director to be appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">The Czech taxpayer has not issued vat returns since April 2006.</seg>
<seg id="816">In the context of the parallel investigation, the NCA, in cooperation with the BRH, examined several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two courts of auditors exchanged information on the cases audited through the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (UCR) which is not established in Germany informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intended to carry out taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">On the basis of this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria in the name, risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to insufficient in-house production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German taxable person (UDE) in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:</seg>
<seg id="824">– The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for assembly on its behalf, at its own risk and for its own account.</seg>
<seg id="825">Due to the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– Since the freight forwarder was contracted by the Danish undertaking (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and on its own account, the place of delivery of the German subcontractor (UDE) is where the transport began, i.e. in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no exemption could be claimed for the supply of the German subcontractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the supply was intended is different from the country of residence of the Czech company19.</seg>
<seg id="828">Accordingly, this supply is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport began.</seg>
<seg id="830">However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">– The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">– The delivery of the other wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community supplies either in its German tax returns or in its ZM submitted to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The NCP found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community supplies to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the NCA and the BRH examined case arrangements to show the size of the differences caused by the different legislation in 2004 between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="839">The cases examined also show that it will take some time for taxpayers and FATs to apply the new legal provisions:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods totalling CZK 792,977,452 to a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech taxable person reported in his ZM intra-Community supplies to another German taxable person for a total value of CZK 18,157,265.</seg>
<seg id="842">It was apparent from the information provided by the BRH to the NCA that in both cases they were electricity supplies.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech taxpayers took into account the abovementioned supplies in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No 235/2004 in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NCA found that in 2004 different legal provisions on the supply or acquisition of electrical energy were applicable between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="845">Whereas in the Czech Republic taxpayers are responsible for the supply of electrical energy in accordance with the regulations of Law No. 235/2004 declared as intra-Community supplies of goods, according to the German legislation in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The differences in legislation were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. When examining intra-Community supplies or Acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH further established that a Czech taxable person declared in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 intra-Community supplies to a German taxable person with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech taxable person in his ZM for the same period within The Intra-Community Supply to another German taxable person worth CZK 263,470,776.</seg>
<seg id="848">Information provided by the BRH to the NCA showed that in both cases it was a supply of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">In accordance with the wording of Law No 235/2004, which expires on 1 January 2005, the place of performance in the supply of electrical energy is the place of performance where the purchaser has his legal place of business, his place of business or his permanent establishment for which that supply is made.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have indicated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electrical energy in their CpRs as intra-Community supplies led to a difference in the amount of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="852">Closing remarks</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NA.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both courts gained in-depth knowledge of the systems of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed differences between the two systems and the legal provisions applicable to VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="857">For some of them, it's worth another observation.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit results, both courts of auditors drew up recommendations on the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control check should be part of the follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two courts of auditors is the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the field of VAT administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NA) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both for the State and for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state's task is to use public funds as economically and sparingly as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements for their contracts from certain value limits (thresholds).</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, EU Member States must transposed and apply EU public procurement law into national law.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The award of services is also a corruption-prone area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In view of the inherently high potential for damage, contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favours in the award of their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NA) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits for both eu-wide awarding of construction services and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="14">The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law, which is transposed into national rules, and the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in construction and road construction or transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">Procurement below the EU thresholds was also considered in terms of anti-corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit results of both Courts of Auditors are summarised in this Joint Report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report will also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="18">Examination areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits carried out in 2011/2012 by the building administrations responsible for the road and construction of the federal government in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">In doing so, he examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the Federal Audit Office used results from previous investigations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011. The audits included construction work in road construction, rail transport, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the procurement of public contracts by the federal government is mainly carried out by the building administrations of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for transport infrastructure procurement.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the construction sector, the contracts are carried out decentrally by those bodies which use state budgets.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, freelancers are also involved in sub-sectors of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="26">In comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and in the market structure for construction services of both countries must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the implementation of E-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to the national sphere are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules based on it.</seg>
<seg id="30">For both EU-wide and national procurement, many supplementary individual rules are also provided by internal administrative provisions,</seg>
<seg id="31">such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the Confederation, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in compliance with the law on public procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other legal provisions applicable to both the area above and below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">Procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules increased transparency in the use of public funds, allowed for greater competition and limited the possibilities of corruption in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Basic features of public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, EU-wide procurement is subject in particular to the open procedure, the open procedure and the negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, measures below the EU threshold are subject to national procurement types (public procurement, restricted tendering, hands-free procurement), but which are broadly in line with the above-mentioned EU-wide procurement types.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of open procedure (in the case of EU-wide contracts) and public procurement (for national contracts).</seg>
<seg id="39">In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested company may submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="41">For this purpose, the main purpose is to divide an overall construction project into specialist and partial lots.</seg>
<seg id="42">The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both of the above-mentioned features of German public procurement law are proven tools for achieving economic results.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction companies employ 1.9 million people in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">One exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and, under certain conditions, to a less stringent procedure.</seg>
<seg id="47">Czech public procurement law contains provisions, in line with EU law, that contracts should be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between the open procedure and the restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Volume of construction of contracting authorities and shares of procurement types in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to EUR 307 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of this amount, EUR 45.5 billion was accounted for by public works (15%), which includes, in addition to federal construction, the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The federal construction volume in construction and long-distance road construction (excluding rail infrastructure and hydraulic engineering) amounted to EUR 8.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="54">The volume of contracts for construction and road construction by the Federal Government was distributed among the award types in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% of non-open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiated and hands-free contracts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Of these, 33.2% were European-wide contracts.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 4.7 billion in 2011, which represented about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, the volume amounted to EUR 7.8 billion, representing 37% of the total construction volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% Negotiated procedures 8.4% Simplified procedures for contract volumes below the 2.7% threshold</seg>
<seg id="59">The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public procurement bodies in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The above data show that the parallel audits carried out by both countries are directed towards a significant part of public procurement, which is of great financial importance in all procurements, and that open procedure and public tendering are of paramount importance in the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the results of the parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NA) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the allocation of construction services and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="63">In this context, the working groups of both courts of auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out, in particular in the fields of construction and road construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">In essence, they found:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (points 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the EU requirements, the prevention of corruption is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, some of which differ in their priorities and their details (No. 3.2).</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, an essential requirement for procurement documents is that they must contain all the information needed to prepare a proper tender.</seg>
<seg id="68">The service descriptions must be neutral and must not have any competition-restrictive requirements.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject-matter of the contract sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, construction work must be divided into lots if possible in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">In its audits, particularly in the field of road construction, the NCA found that the award of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="74">Constrictions in market potential can lead to significant cost increases and risk price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">Under the provisions of both countries, under certain conditions, contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree with the undertakings already contracted to agree on additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (point 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective requirements for determining the award type were mostly followed in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure applies to EU-wide contracts or public tenders, which corresponds to the open procedure for national awards.</seg>
<seg id="79">This will allow more companies to submit bids.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price agreements between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building administrations generally awarded the works throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct estimating of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis when choosing the right award type.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, cost databases are used for cost assessments of public buildings, in particular in the construction sector,</seg>
<seg id="84">based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">In the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and notices must be published. This should strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to adapt to the proposed contracts at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="87">The audited building administrations generally complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (point 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of candidates to participate in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be made known in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should switch as often as possible among the companies to be asked to choose in the selection of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="93">In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="94">The audited administrations did not take these requirements into account in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, the selection of candidates was not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, in the interests of equal opportunities, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in submitting tenders receive the same information during the bidding phase.</seg>
<seg id="97">Contact between those undertakings and with freelancers involved in the preparation of the service description must be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">The audited building administrations in Germany partially complied with these requirements (No. 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency must be observed in particular when opening up offers.</seg>
<seg id="101">The requirements for the labelling, documentation, storage and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly well defined in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audits in both countries revealed only a few complaints (Point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by guidelines for the organisation of the structure and process.</seg>
<seg id="104">The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting authorities handed over tenders for examination to third parties without first reviewing the tenders and adequately documenting abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="106">As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">At the conclusion of EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies participating in the competition will be informed of the proposed contract before the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="109">The Czech Republic also provides for a judicial review for non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities not meet the deadlines for awarding contracts or deviated from the content of the tenderers' tender (point 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible by the audited building administrations in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In this respect, the EU-wide requirement of transparency was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notes of some procedures.</seg>
<seg id="113">Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the corruption-preventing function of documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">EU public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general principles of public procurement in the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination and the requirement of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive lays down specific rules for construction work to be awarded across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="120">For this purpose, their expected order amounts must reach or exceed the current amount of 5,000,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="121">The rules concern, in particular, the content of the procurement documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia, the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the procurement procedure, the requirements which may be made on the qualifications of candidates and the Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, undertakings concerned may have the decisions of contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.</seg>

<seg id="126">In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is the abuse of a trust for private gain,</seg>
<seg id="128">which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of those decisions.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the global costs of corruption amount to 5% of world economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the European Union, the cost is estimated at 1%.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair conduct may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">In doing so, they must check the organisation of their administrations' organisation of activities in areas at high risk of corruption in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption there.</seg>
<seg id="135">Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuses.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corrupt field of work.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption – in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits – is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="139">In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on the prevention of corruption12 in the Federal Administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles must be observed for the procurement sector: priority for public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, basic separation of planning, procurement and settlement, precise and complete documentation of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, other anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, for example, the competent Federal Ministry for Contracts for Contracts for Contracts in the field of federal highways introduced an electronically-based control system,</seg>
<seg id="142">with the procurement data, such as estimated costs and order sums, as well as information on the freelancers involved, information is collected nationwide and evaluated for abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="143">Corruption is also prosecuted in the Czech Republic under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, are the most important foundations for the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in an anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions14.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation essentially contains the following rules: reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation to publish contracts in good time by the contracting authority, including the indication of the grounds for tendering, prohibition of the restriction of the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus abolishthe possibility of selecting tenderers by means of lottery procedures, introduction of the obligation to publish contract documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Examination results for the various stages of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Procurement documents Procurement documents must contain all the information that tenderers need to prepare a proper tender.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the procurement documents must enable an accurate calculation.</seg>
<seg id="152">Tenderers must not be given risks that cannot be calculated on their part.</seg>
<seg id="153">The procurement documents consist in particular of the specifications and the terms of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="154">In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the tenderers and the criteria that are relevant for the selection of the most economical tender.</seg>
<seg id="155">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="156">The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are addressed in particular to the technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="157">These must be equally accessible to all tenderers and should limit competition as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="158">The service description must in principle be product-neutral.</seg>
<seg id="159">Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.</seg>
<seg id="160">Avoiding restrictive requirements in procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the procurement documents must be avoided, since it opens up scope for speculation in the preparation of tenders and for manipulation of their valuation.</seg>
<seg id="162">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="163">Same or similar rules In both countries, the EU legal requirements for technical specifications have been transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="164">In principle, the services must be advertised in a product-neutral manner without manufacturer requirements.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the service descriptions, the individual services must normally be broken down in detail into performance units with the respective quantities.</seg>
<seg id="166">Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m2 or per unit).</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases can performance be defined by functional targets.</seg>
<seg id="168">In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="169">They shall contain precise quantities and shall not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.</seg>
<seg id="170">Compensation according to flat rates or time expenditure should be avoided as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified requirements in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The service descriptions must enable tenderers to prepare their tenders safely and without extensive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The call for tenders will not be made public until the procurement documents have been finalised.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="175">There is no obligation in the Czech Republic to tender for works in lots.</seg>
<seg id="176">If it is possible according to the nature of the service to be carried out, the public contracting authorities may divide works into several lots.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, construction work must in principle be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and/or by type or subject areas (specialist lots).</seg>
<seg id="178">The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in competition, to increase the number of potential suppliers and to make it more difficult to agree on prices.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.</seg>
<seg id="180">Evaluation criteria must be specified in the procurement documents in the Czech Republic, both in EU-wide and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">The aim is to make it fully and conclusively clear to the candidates on the criteria on which their tenders are to be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="183">In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria are to be recorded only in an internal award note.</seg>
<seg id="184">Procurement documents drawn up by authorised freelancers may not contain any reference to these offices or participating planners or appraisers to the civil engineering and some road construction administrations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge of contact with these freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send procurement documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contact person of the companies is the client alone.</seg>
<seg id="188">There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always incurred in the case of large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="190">In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of supplements to the undertaking already contracted without the need for a public disclosure procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">According to EU and German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary benefits may not exceed half of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to such a contract without public notice.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already under way.</seg>
<seg id="195">If supplementary services are also delegated to the company that has already been commissioned, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is not possible in principle under the regulations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="196">In order to determine the remuneration for the additional services, it must be based on the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already awarded.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.</seg>
<seg id="199">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="200">Bhr</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards which had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications – for example for graffiti protection, joint belts or noise protection panels – without this being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, performance requirements were described in such detail that only one product was eligible.</seg>
<seg id="205">Lists of services broken down by partial benefit</seg>
<seg id="206">In none of the proceedings examined, the BRH has found breaches of the requirement to tender benefits in principle in a list of services broken down by partial service.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="208">In the vast majority of procedures, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="209">In some procedures, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tendering phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.</seg>
<seg id="210">Occasionally, the lists of services contained items where it was not clear whether they were needed.</seg>
<seg id="211">In fact, almost half of the list of services for demolition work consisted of such demand items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Lots and scoring criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In many awards, the prescribed justification for the reasons why the services advertised mainly according to the unspecified were not further divided into partial lots.</seg>
<seg id="214">There were no objections when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="215">References to freelancers</seg>
<seg id="216">A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.</seg>
<seg id="217">Their names were partly on the cover pages or in attached plans or opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even expressly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of tendering".</seg>
<seg id="219">In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints identified mainly to the failures of the freelancers responsible for the preparation of the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="220">The construction services pointed to the lack of capacity to adequately control the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="221">NKO</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.</seg>
<seg id="223">The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without giving reasons for this.</seg>
<seg id="224">In the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="225">Service descriptions with performance units</seg>
<seg id="226">In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly state the scope and nature of the services required in the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="227">As performance units, it merely indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="229">In the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were changed four times in the period August to September 2009 in the course of an open procedure,</seg>
<seg id="230">as the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.</seg>
<seg id="231">Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary construction tests and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services.</seg>
<seg id="232">When building a large library building, the specifications of the interior design did not contain any requirements for product quality.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result of these lack of requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lots and eligibility criteria</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, the division of construction work into partial contracts or the award of subcontracts is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="236">An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring road showed that savings of up to EUR 31.6 million at a total cost of EUR 620.3 million would have been possible if selected parts had been awarded.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, in the case of six different works which were the subject of a single contract, eur 2.5 million (25%) would have been awarded in a separate award. savings can be made.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the construction of 20 bridges were to be awarded in a way that would be unallocated, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would be have been possible.</seg>
<seg id="239">When awarding construction services in road construction, the central awarding body set very extensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required tenderers in an open procedure, inter alia, to provide evidence of at least three road projects carried out, each worth EUR 28 million, from the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public award of another section of a motorway consisted of six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million over the last three years as a criterion for suitability for the undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. EUR 2.5 billion out of a total of EUR 3.7 billion) were allocated to contracts from a total of five companies carrying out the contracts alone or as a working group.</seg>
<seg id="244">In 46 procurement procedures with a contract volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even only one tenderer submitted a tender.</seg>
<seg id="245">The NA showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Additional services</seg>
<seg id="247">In the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the procedures required by law in two cases when awarding additional services and did not enter into written contracts for the additional services.</seg>
<seg id="248">Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, supplements of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) were incurred in the first case and up to EUR 165.4 million (net) in the second case, increasing the respective order volume by 21% and 91%, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="249">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="250">In the case of several university buildings, some of the services were not included in the procurement documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="251">Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original value of the contract laid down in national public procurement law, the contracting authority carried out negotiated procedures with the contracting companies without a contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the case of the construction of a large court house, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiated procedures without a call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction period, the contracting authority increased the scope of the works by EUR 2 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices for the additional works awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.</seg>
<seg id="255">Further findings</seg>
<seg id="256">On the basis of a random examination of construction projects, the NCA found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic was up to EUR 14.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an analysis of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="260">The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly in line with the rules on procurement documents in both countries and take account of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="261">They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">For example, the requirement to ensure that the specifications are sufficiently determined should enable tenderers to calculate and prepare their tenders properly,</seg>
<seg id="263">protect the client from additional services to be agreed retrospectively and also reduce the scope for speculation.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the common basic requirements for procurement documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions of competition and the possibility of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="265">In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria in non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="266">The requirements for the service description have been largely complied with in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, there have been discrepancies which may have led to restrictions of competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The existing requirement to create lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.</seg>
<seg id="269">In the Czech Republic, according to the findings of the NCA's audit findings, the award of large-scale services without lots or with only very large lots may result in restrictions on the supplier field to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="270">The extensive reference requirements laid down in the Czech Republic for road construction have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow group of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">When it is possible to award and remuneration additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to EU and German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor under the negotiation procedure without notice.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="277">because the scope of public procurement services is often insufficiently defined.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the overrun exceeds 20%, the additional services must be advertised with a public notice.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing benefits into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Setting the award type and taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of award, the contracting authority determines the size of the number of undertakings participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">It may leave the number of potential candidates and tenderers largely unlimited or limit them by specifying non-public procurement procedures, for example by choosing an open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="283">For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, pan-European procurement procedures shall be applied.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total contract value of a project's works is at or above the EU threshold of currently EUR 5,000,000, the works are, in principle, to be awarded throughout Europe according to open or restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="288">In the case of construction projects which reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Pan-European award and award works in national procurement contracts, provided that the estimated contract value of the relevant lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and that the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all works contracts.</seg>
<seg id="289">A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to remove it from the obligation to award the works in principle throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="290">Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the method of awarding is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="291">The detailed justification of the chosen type of award and the examination of the obligation to apply EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully transposed EU procurement rules and the threshold into national law.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has also transferred the principle of equalstatus of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its building contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="297">There is freedom of choice between the open procedure and the restricted procedure, without the decision being documented or justified. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible under certain conditions defined by law.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or, in the case of national contracts, public procurement, is, in principle, a priority. This is laid down by budgetary and procurement law and by the anti-corruption directives.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of award, such as the restricted procedure or the restricted invitation to tender, are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in public procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of the primacy of open procedure or public tendering is intended to ensure as unlimited competition as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by specifying certain tenderers and to make it more difficult to agree on prices between tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="302">The principle of public procurement is a central element of the prevention of corruption in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimating of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis when choosing the right award type.</seg>
<seg id="304">The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the estimated costs in the field of public construction.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost parameters for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction works.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such cost indicators, the estimated contract value of a planned project or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.</seg>
<seg id="307">In Germany, only a few building administrations have corresponding cost databases for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price calculations of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated cost of construction work.</seg>
<seg id="310">On the contrary, in most cases, the cost assessments are based on estimates by the financing body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.</seg>
<seg id="312">The relevant ministries were commissioned to draw up a database for standardised building materials and materials as part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012.</seg>
<seg id="313">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="314">This database is intended to collect information on material costs and construction and extension works as well as other cost-relevant data in order to enable cost determinations and determinations of unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects in order to improve costs,</seg>
<seg id="316">which is intended to serve as a benchmark for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="317">Key test results BRH</seg>
<seg id="318">Choice of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities largely advertised the works in open procedure or in public tenders, thus following the requirements of budgetary and public procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction works in the construction sector were put out to public tender or open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">The choice of non-public procurement types lacked, in part, detailed reasons why the contracting authorities had to depart from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.</seg>
<seg id="323">In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH, based on more than 16,000 procurement procedures, found that non-public procurement types have significant competitive disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">In the construction sector, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as for hands-free tenders.</seg>
<seg id="325">The investigation also showed that, on average, tender prices for restricted tenders and hands-free contracts were 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a Land Audit Office confirmed the differences in economic efficiency between public and non-public procurement types.</seg>
<seg id="327">As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Construction even found that there were twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="329">The audited contracting authorities generally drawn up procurement plans for the construction projects for which they had identified an estimated total contract amount of more than EUR 5,000,000, in which they determined the works to be awarded by EXTENSION and the works to be awarded in accordance with national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, more than 80% of construction work was always to be awarded across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to award EU-wide contracts by underestimating cost estimates.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in part as a result of erroneous calculations, the minimum share of the CONTRACT continued procurement procedures was actually fell short.</seg>
<seg id="333">During the construction process, some contracting authorities inadmissibly changed the specifications of their procurement plans.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures remained in compliance.</seg>
<seg id="335">For most of the construction projects audited, the proportion of EU-wide contracts awarded was usually lower than under the procurement plan according to the results of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="336">In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities failed to meet the requirement to tender for all EUR 1,000,000 and more comprehensive individual lots in EU-wide procedures,</seg>
<seg id="337">and chose national procedures instead.</seg>
<seg id="338">NKO</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of the type of award</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.</seg>
<seg id="341">As a result of these distributions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in breach of legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="342">Calculation methods for the estimated order value</seg>
<seg id="343">In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were insufficient tools to determine the expected order values.</seg>
<seg id="344">The data were based on construction projects that had just been completed, but there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional performance or excessive profits of the contracted firms.</seg>
<seg id="345">For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than the projected order values determined by the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increases indices in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the construction sector, the expected contract values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on investor estimates.</seg>
<seg id="348">Actual order values differed greatly from estimates.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later, but eight additions in the course of the construction resulted in an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros or 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, the actual value of the contract for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the offer prices exceeded the estimates and increased during the construction.</seg>
<seg id="352">When a large library was built, the estimated price was exceeded by EUR 16 million, or 22%. The cost of building a judicial building increased disproportionately by 139%, as the usable area had increased by only 12%.</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have transposed EU rules to define the type of procurement and to take into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the priority of the open procedure or public tendering procedure in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in competition in public procedures or public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="357">Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of tenders and the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="358">The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not restricting the field of candidates by tampering-prone determinations of the contracting authority and by making price agreements between bidders more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="359">The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or the public tendering procedure in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="360">Under Czech legislation, contracting agencies can award contracts in open or restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="361">Under the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of tenderers may no longer be restricted in proceedings involving previous competition.</seg>
<seg id="362">Thus, the open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tendering procedure. In the Czech Republic, some services have been unduly divided in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.</seg>
<seg id="364">When taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be identified in Germany, which resulted in a fall below the minimum share of benefits advertised throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to correctly determine the estimated costs of construction work and construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">Where appropriate, the building administrations should ensure, by means of further checks, that the requirements for the choice of the type of award and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for correct cost assessments are created.</seg>
<seg id="367">Pre-information and announcement</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public developer must inform interested companies of the proposed contracts in advance of the call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="369">Pre-information and announcements form an important basis for Pan-European competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">The preliminary information should include the essential procurement information on the planned construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">They are necessary for those construction projects where the estimated total value of the contract reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting authority intends to shorten the tender ingenuation of open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">Notices shall make it mandatory for the contracting authority to provide more detailed details of the works to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="374">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other things, it must make known the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.</seg>
<seg id="376">The common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes) is to be used in the description of the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and notices shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the client's profile.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices at national level may not contain additional information and may not be issued until after the publication text has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or inaccurate information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="380">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="382">The EU legal requirements for pre-information and publication have been fully transposed into national law by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="383">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published in the case of works which are not to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="385">Procurement procedures may be started at the earliest one month after the pre-information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (in the case of EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).</seg>
<seg id="386">Only in exceptional cases can the publication of preliminary information be dispensed with.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, no prior information is required in non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and competition before restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Internet portal and, where appropriate, in newspapers or periodicals.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted invitations to tender without competition, notices of services to be awarded of 25,000 euros or more are required (ex ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">The preliminary information shall include all the intended lots of the construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="391">In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small part of the unrelated building awards.</seg>
<seg id="392">In the Czech Republic, this scheme has only a small impact, as there is much less construction work divided into lots.</seg>
<seg id="393">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Preliminary information</seg>
<seg id="396">The awarding bodies examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction work to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="397">However, in some open procedures, they shortened tender deadlines, even though the 52-day period required between the submissions of the prior information and the notices had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">Other shortened procedures were not put out to tender until the 12-month period of validity of the prior information had expired and had been extended.</seg>
<seg id="399">Many published preliminary information lacked evidence of the planned division of construction work into lots.</seg>
<seg id="400">Notices</seg>
<seg id="401">The notices of the audited bodies contained in part CPV codes which differed from the information provided in the prior information or which did not accurately record the required services.</seg>
<seg id="402">In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information, for example on deadlines for implementation, than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">The contracting authorities of an audited construction administration had commissioned a service undertaking to publish the national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="405">The latter published the reports on its own paid award platform.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contracting authorities did not verify whether the company had forwarded the notifications to the free Internet portal of the Federal Government as required.</seg>
<seg id="407">Samples showed that only one third of the audited administration's notifications were published on this portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">NKO</seg>
<seg id="409">Notices</seg>
<seg id="410">In the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on the basis of which it intended to select the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="411">The contracting authority was unable to demonstrate how the tenderers were selected.</seg>
<seg id="412">The restriction on the number of tenderers was permissible under the law in force at the time.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, either in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it intended to assess the qualifications of the candidates and how many candidates it wished to admit to competition.</seg>
<seg id="414">In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six candidates met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="415">The contracting authority's approach was not transparent because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of notices</seg>
<seg id="417">During the refurbishment of former military sites, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.</seg>
<seg id="418">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage information system with pre-information and notice is an important element in implementing the transparency requirement in Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">Both countries have implemented EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector:</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates for non-public procurement types</seg>
<seg id="422">Unlike public procurement procedures, not every undertaking interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition in the case of non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="423">In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a prior selection of which undertakings should be invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption Eu rules allow for a limitation of the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, in the case of restricted procedures, at least five companies must be required to tender.</seg>
<seg id="426">At least three companies shall be invited in negotiated procedures with a contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be made known in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly vulnerable to manipulation, for example by allowing one-sided preference for certain companies.</seg>
<seg id="430">In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between candidates.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both cases, the result of the contract may be significantly affected to the detriment of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="432">The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate controls and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="435">The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding authorities should switch as often as possible among the companies to be asked when selecting candidates.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor must competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The contracting authorities shall justify the selection of candidates and document the course of the selection procedure in their award notes.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three suitable candidates are required to tender in the case of restricted invitations to tender and, in the case of hands-free contracts, several suitable candidates are required to tender.</seg>
<seg id="441">Under the new Czech rules, it is inadmissible to limit the number of tenderers in the case of restricted and negotiated procedures, with the exception of two special areas.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.</seg>
<seg id="443">For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction department or a contractor from the contracting authority must normally amend this proposal, for example by removing a proposed company and/or supplementing a new company.</seg>
<seg id="444">The aim is to prevent an individual from being able to determine the final circle of undertakings to be involved in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching agreements between the parties.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of companies to be requested must be kept confidential, including with regard to freelancers, and not made publicly available.</seg>
<seg id="447">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic, there are no such rules for the establishment and secrecy of lists of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under the German rules, freelancers are not allowed to designate the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is a loophole in Czech legislation on this.</seg>
<seg id="451">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of applicants</seg>
<seg id="454">The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to bid for non-public contracts has been complied with, with a few exceptions.</seg>
<seg id="455">An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction work in construction showed that the contracting authorities requested an average of 6.6 in Germany for restricted tenders and an average of 4.4 companies for hands-free contracts.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of companies and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular, in the case of trades with few suppliers, the awarding authorities did not always change the number of selected candidates.</seg>
<seg id="458">In particular, they took into account companies that were already known and, in their view, proven.</seg>
<seg id="459">As a reason for this, they stated that, in non-public proceedings, the undertakings to be invited to compete must be ensured before the invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="460">The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional tenderers in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally resident companies than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of non-public procurement procedures is on average much smaller and therefore, for example, longer journeys are more important than in the case of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Multi-eyes principle and proposals for freelancers</seg>
<seg id="463">Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.</seg>
<seg id="464">They justified this in particular by a lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.</seg>
<seg id="465">It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="466">Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the candidate lists and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="467">In this way, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidential treatment of bidder lists</seg>
<seg id="469">A contracting authority recorded the lists of undertakings to be requested in a data processing system which could be consulted by all the staff of that service.</seg>
<seg id="470">In the event of manipulative intent, the names of the proposed or authorised undertakings could have been disclosed without authorisation and could, for example, have facilitated agreements between these undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation of the procurement procedures contained only a few reasons for the selection of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="473">NKO</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection of candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">When building a motorway ring, tenderers did not receive information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="476">In the case of the restricted procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="477">In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the maximum number of companies to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="478">The procurement committee then carried out a lottery procedure for the selection of companies.</seg>
<seg id="479">However, that approach, which was in principle admissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="481">Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent inadmissible restrictions of competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole power of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements restrict such opportunities for abuse.</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement for the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have not been sufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings identified.</seg>
<seg id="486">Offer phase</seg>
<seg id="487">The tendering phase begins with the publication of the award or the invitation to tender, during which undertakings can prepare tenders on the basis of the procurement documents sent to them.</seg>
<seg id="488">Candidates may submit their tenders by the end of the tender period fixed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">There are no separate EU legal requirements for this stage of the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authorities must comply with the national rules designed to counteract the manipulation possibilities that exist during the tendering phase.</seg>
<seg id="492">These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.</seg>
<seg id="493">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="495">The procurement documents on the basis of which the undertakings are to prepare their tenders must, in principle, be sent only by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Freelancers involved in the procurement procedure may not carry out this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority shall ensure that all candidates receive the same information during the tendering phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of ambiguity in the procurement documents or other questions relating to the invitation to tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="499">Freelancers responsible for the preparation of the procurement documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the entire offer phase, contact must be prevented between the authorised freelancers and the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="501">Freelancers must not become a hub of the procurement procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.</seg>
<seg id="502">Offers submitted by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Electronically transmitted tenders shall have technical encryption.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may also commission external service companies to print and send the procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers confidential and to comply with the contractual obligations conscientiously.</seg>
<seg id="506">The tenders received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and forwarded immediately, immediately and unopened to a staff member responsible for custody.</seg>
<seg id="507">That staff member shall not be involved in the award.</seg>
<seg id="508">The received offers must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a reference number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority shall record the tender data, including the order numbers, as well as the production and receipt information in a log.</seg>
<seg id="511">The custody of the offers is not specified in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="512">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">The examinations for the tender phase focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building administration.</seg>
<seg id="515">Dispatch of procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The contracting authorities of the audited building administration sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and dispatched by an external service company.</seg>
<seg id="517">Freelancers did not send out procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to applicants</seg>
<seg id="519">The audited building administration did not meet the requirements for the separation of planning and procurement in the designation of the contact persons for queries and information.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the awarding authority, but from the project management as contact persons.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some procurement documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had drawn up the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="522">In some cases, not all applicants received the same information in the case of requests during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="523">Labelling of offers</seg>
<seg id="524">At the audited building management, all received tenders were marked with an entry stamp and an entry note.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in some hands-free awards, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the pro-corruption allegations.</seg>
<seg id="526">Keeping the offers</seg>
<seg id="527">Once marked, not all tenders were received immediately and immediately by the custody officer, who included the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">In the meantime, the offers were placed in an open compartment of the post office in a construction department, to which each employee had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another department had hung a letterbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which the offers thrown in there sometimes remained overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">Since the insertion slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to take received offers and, if necessary, manipulate them.</seg>
<seg id="531">NKO</seg>
<seg id="532">No defects were complained of on the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="534">During the tendering phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement procedure are to be prevented in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="535">In addition, by providing all tenderers with the same information, the principle of equal treatment is to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="536">The rules on receipt, custody and confidentiality of offers appear to be suitable for countering manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the rules in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These shortcomings could be addressed with little effort.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made public.</seg>
<seg id="543">From the opening date, tenderers shall be bound by their tenders until the expiry of the contract period set by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">There are no separate EU rules for opening up tenders.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, national rules on the prevention of corruption contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="547">The multi-eyes principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer are intended to prevent manipulations and changes in the submitted offers.</seg>
<seg id="548">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be determined by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrollably when opening up the offers.</seg>
<seg id="552">In most procurement procedures, tenderers can participate in the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="553">Only offers which have been received by the negotiator at the time of the opening of the first offer are permitted for opening.</seg>
<seg id="554">Late received offers may in principle no longer be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the acts taken and the results of the opening of the tender shall be set out in a protocol, including the names of the tenderers and the price of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="556">The minutes shall be read out and signed by the negotiating management.</seg>
<seg id="557">It can also be signed by the bidders present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a committee is opening up tenders.</seg>
<seg id="560">Freelancers can also participate.</seg>
<seg id="561">The Committee may also be entrusted with further stages of the procurement procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary are opening up the offer.</seg>
<seg id="563">The negotiator must be a staff member of the tendering body.</seg>
<seg id="564">The negotiator and, in the case of contracts awarded in the construction sector, the secretary, shall not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the award and contract execution.</seg>
<seg id="565">According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date must include not only the offer prices but also information on discounts and discounts as well as special features such as damaged or late-received offers.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's signature authority are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="567">The German regulations stipulate that all parts of the open offers must be marked in such a way as to prevent subsequent changes and additions.</seg>
<seg id="568">The offers are now characterized by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing them.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are no such Czech regulations.</seg>
<seg id="570">If only one offer is received in a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unvalued.</seg>
<seg id="571">There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received here, it must be opened and then evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="573">BRH</seg>
<seg id="574">Multi-eyes principle</seg>
<seg id="575">The audited award ingessies implemented the requirements for the Multi-Eye principle at the opening dates.</seg>
<seg id="576">They each held the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries who were not entrusted with any other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in the case of hands-free awarding of lesser scope of services, there were occasional cases in which freelancers opened tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Protocol</seg>
<seg id="579">The opening of the offers was not always fully documented in the minutes of the opening dates.</seg>
<seg id="580">Some of the late tenders were not registered, for example, and in some cases even signatures were missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Labelling of offers</seg>
<seg id="582">The contracting authorities examined in the cross-sectional audit identified the tenders in accordance with the requirements by perforating them with the date of the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="583">Insufficient labelling had been found in recent audits carried out by some beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practice after the BRH complained.</seg>
<seg id="585">NKO</seg>
<seg id="586">Offer period</seg>
<seg id="587">When road maintenance measures were awarded, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the tender period. However, the contracting authority accepted this offer.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="589">The rules of both countries for the opening of offers are in significant agreement. They take into account both the Multi-Eye principle and the principle of transparency. This can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation in opening up offers.</seg>
<seg id="590">The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as for the labelling, safe storage and confidentiality of tenders significantly restrict the possibility of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, those responsible for opening the tenders may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The overall only few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for opening up the offer.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of the offers</seg>
<seg id="595">Examination and evaluation of tenders The client must examine and evaluate the tenders available at the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="596">In doing so, it shall determine the tender for awarding the contract which best meets the requirements in accordance with the specified award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:</seg>
<seg id="599">First of all, the suitability of the tenderers must be established.</seg>
<seg id="600">Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="601">In principle, companies that have been convicted of bribery offences must be excluded from participation in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="602">The tenders of the bidders not excluded must be examined mathematically, technically and economically and assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority must determine the most economically advantageous tender. Offers with unusually low prices must be examined by the client in particular.</seg>
<seg id="604">The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, bidders may be unfairly excluded or tenders which do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The preference or disadvantage of tenderers may unduly affect the score and thus prevent the finding of the most economically advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take special measures to ensure that the persons responsible for the audit and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.</seg>
<seg id="608">It must also ensure the transparency and comprehensibility of the procedure and of the decisions taken.</seg>
<seg id="609">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="611">In line with EU requirements, offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements for the qualifications of the undertakings to be submitted, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting, are laid down in the notices or in the procurement documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">Once the suitability of the tender has been examined, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="614">The evaluation must be limited to the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be formally examined as to whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities which could indicate possible manipulation intentions.</seg>
<seg id="616">If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the valuation of the tenders results in an unreasonably low price, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment before any exclusion of his tender.</seg>
<seg id="618">The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the tenders must be documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing them.</seg>
<seg id="621">Only the contracting authority may carry out the examination of tenders and the calculation of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="622">It shall only appoint staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.</seg>
<seg id="623">The performance of the further examination and evaluation tasks is not specified.</seg>
<seg id="624">If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, procurement committees must be set up to examine and evaluate tenders.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees draw up evaluation reports with proposals for contracts.</seg>
<seg id="628">Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="629">If in Germany the evidence or declarations required for the submission of tenders are submitted only incompletely, the contracting authority shall give the tenderers the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer must be excluded from the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the tenders must also be examined.</seg>
<seg id="634">Where, on the basis of the price structure of the tender, indications arise of prices for partial services that are too low or too high, the tenderer shall be asked to clear up these ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id="635">If it fails to do so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of prices, this offer must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their bid, which can result in significant cost increases in construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price is valued, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.</seg>
<seg id="638">A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">A surcharge may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.</seg>
<seg id="640">Where one or more tenders fall short of the relevant price determination of the contracting authority or the tender sums of the other tenderers by 10 % or more, tenderers shall prove the correct calculation of their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the tenders in question.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders may be cancelled after an economic assessment if only tenders with unjustifiable low prices are available.</seg>
<seg id="643">In contrast to German public procurement law, the award cannot be refused for this reason in the case of tenders with prices substantially higher than the principal's calculation.</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its specialist supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">It must decide what measures to take and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.</seg>
<seg id="646">For example, the level of technical supervision must also agree to works over EUR 50,000 if a contract is to be awarded by hand, a contract is not awarded to the tender with the lowest price or if the invitation to tender is to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">There are no regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Suitability and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">The vast majority of the procurement procedures examined complied with the requirements set out above.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not themselves verify the suitability of the undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="653">An aid esignr commissioned undertakings without the required proof of suitability being fully available.</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, it was not clear whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the award criteria made public in its selection decision or whether it had merely used the criterion 'price' in its award decision.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities used persons not authorised to do so when examining tenders.</seg>
<seg id="657">For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks which could only be carried out by employees of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction services justified this by insufficient staffing capacity in the respective areas.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to scrupulously comply with the contractual obligations also took part in the examination of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="660">For the construction services, it was also mostly incomprehensible whether the offers were only accessible to the persons directly responsible for processing them.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and computational examination of tenders</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting authorities handed over the open tenders to freelancers for further examination, without first having carried out the prescribed review of the tenders and the computational examination themselves and having documented their results.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the tenders without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="664">In the verified documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partially not or only insufficiently marked.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">In a sample in a building administration, the most favourable tenders for three quarters of the procurement procedures examined differed more than 10% from the estimated costs previously determined.</seg>
<seg id="667">One in 20 procurement procedures has been cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">Not all tender reviews and information discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, closer information was lacking, such as on the unit prices of the most important items.</seg>
<seg id="670">In many ways, the deviations were only justified on a flat-rate basis, e.g. by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction services explained that it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of a call for tenders from an institution governed by public law, the offer price of the most favourable tender was 66% below the previously established estimate of those services.</seg>
<seg id="673">Further calculation checks or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="674">In a briefing, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the company then contracted.</seg>
<seg id="675">It remained unclear whether the estimated value was inflated or whether the offer price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the client rated the contracted company as a "cheap company" that could not keep quality or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another call for tenders, a construction service awarded the contract to a tender whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.</seg>
<seg id="678">It did not annum the invitation to tender, citing the unsachentive reasoning that that undertaking could be inferred from a satisfactory calculation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspicion of irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">In an audited building management, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the technical supervision level.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one of the cases, the calculation of two tenderers was identical in a call for tenders, so that the contracting authority excluded both tenders from the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the application of the other rules, the audits did not reveal any material objections.</seg>
<seg id="683">NKO</seg>
<seg id="684">Aptitude test</seg>
<seg id="685">In many of the construction projects examined, including in the construction of higher education, road construction and the extension of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or were unable to demonstrate their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Rating</seg>
<seg id="687">When awarding works for a water treatment plant, the awarding authority disregarded the specified evaluation criteria when examining and assessing tenders.</seg>
<seg id="688">In the case of a construction project to extend the rail network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly assessed in a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the reduction offered was not taken into account by the second and third-position tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the selection of quotations</seg>
<seg id="692">In three procurement procedures in the context of housing promotion, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="693">When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected companies for smaller contracts of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.</seg>
<seg id="694">Examinations of this selection were not possible because the interviews were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="696">The rules for the examination and evaluation of tenders in both countries comply with EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective rules differ.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, the process is more regulated by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers, than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be examined.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, some of the procurement procedures examined had to establish that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or insufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="701">Without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all tenders to third parties without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the tenders and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contracting authorities have tasks carried out in the examination and evaluation of tenders by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to resoatable the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">In assessing the adequacy of prices, the audited services in Germany have not always made full use of the available instruments, and have not sufficiently examined the price structure of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly in the aptitude test and in the application of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">Once the tenders have been examined and the value of the tenders, the award procedure shall be concluded by awarding the contract or by canceling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the proposed procurement decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">Companies have the option of examining the intended award in the case of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or, if necessary, within 15 days for other means of communication, and, if necessary, to initiate an investigation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="711">A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this period of information.</seg>
<seg id="712">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="713">If a tenderer submits a request for verification within the time limit for the information, a contract can only be concluded after the final decision in the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">Companies may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court in the context of this review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="715">The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of undertakings and to encourage the contracting authority to comply with public procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="716">To do so, he must adequately document the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="717">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the outcome of a proper examination and evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority shall place the contract within the announced award period,</seg>
<seg id="723">also because, after the expiry of the period, tenderers are no longer bound by their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="724">In the case of open and restricted procedures or public and restricted invitations to tender, the contracting authority may not deviate from the content of the tender at the time of conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="725">The losing tenderers shall be informed in a timely manner of the award decision and of the reasons for not taking their tenders into account.</seg>
<seg id="726">Procurement procedures may be terminated only under certain conditions, e.g. where the bid prices are inflated or the tenders do not meet the requirements of the invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the 10- or 15-day obligation to provide information and wait before awarding the contract also exists for construction work not to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, these requirements apply only to EU-wide procurement.</seg>
<seg id="730">In the case of other proceedings in Germany, tenderers may not be informed of the award decision until the contract has been awarded.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure must be annulled if only one bid has been received or only one offer could be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only a single valuable tender, provided that it complies with the conditions of the invitation to tender and is economical.</seg>
<seg id="733">Key test results</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">In the case of the contracts examined, there were only a few complaints at the time of the conclusion of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, companies received letters of order in EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may result in the invalidity of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In individual cases, order letters after open procedures also contained content that differed from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, contracting entities did not comply with the award deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="739">In an open procedure, therefore, a contracting authority awarded the contract for the second most favourable tender, since an undertaking with a 50% cheaper tender was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the end of the contract period.</seg>
<seg id="740">NKO</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the tenderer's offer in the contract.</seg>
<seg id="742">In some contracts, for example for road maintenance construction, the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the statutory deadline.</seg>
<seg id="743">In the award of works for the redevelopment of former military sites, the contracting authority forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all tenderers only after the statutory deadline had expired.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements for the completion of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of the losing candidates or bidders increases the scope of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, overruns in the deadlines for awarding contracts have been found.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">Construction administrations should avoid the shortcomings identified in the conclusion of their procurement procedures in the future.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, reporting and reporting requirements</seg>
<seg id="752">Procurement procedures shall be documented in a comprehensible manner during their various stages with regard to the relevant findings and the reasons for each decision.</seg>
<seg id="753">In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.</seg>
<seg id="754">The order data is also recorded in an EU statistic.</seg>
<seg id="755">Eu law requirements and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU's wide-spread transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="756">A carefully and promptly prepared documentation only makes it possible to trace the award decisions.</seg>
<seg id="757">In particular, it also serves to provide effective legal protection for tenderers in the case of procurement above the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential element in preventing corruption, as the compulsion to justify procurement decisions in detail significantly narrows the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent by the relevant contracting authority to the EU Office for Official Publications within 48 days.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the EU Commission produces an annual EU statistic to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction.</seg>
<seg id="763">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>

<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on documentation and reporting obligations into national law.</seg>

<seg id="767">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The publication period is reduced to 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, in addition to EU-wide contracts, there is a duty to publish only in the case of restricted tenders and, in the case of hands-free contracts, contracts with a value limit of EUR 25,000 or EUR 15,000 without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).</seg>
<seg id="771">Below these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the undertakings involved in the competition procedure shall receive information on the award of contracts.</seg>

<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of the procurement procedures examined were not fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as to justify product specifications or to refer to national regulations.</seg>
<seg id="777">In a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to an undertaking, even though its tender did not contain evidence to be made compulsory.</seg>
<seg id="778">In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="779">Notices of procurement</seg>
<seg id="780">In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting authorities failed to publicise the awardof contracts.</seg>

<seg id="785">In most cases, the audited building administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="786">However, a construction administration did not publish this data due to a transmission error.</seg>

<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">In the case of construction work for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the procurement procedures was considerablely flawed. These were mainly inaccurate information, such as incorrect quotation prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some protocols of the opening of tenders were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Notices of procurement</seg>
<seg id="794">In the case of several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were published late or not at all.</seg>

<seg id="796">The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly in line with the rules in both countries and implement the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="797">This will, in principle, ensure the transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="798">The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than those in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="801">Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and procurement and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits carried out by the NCA and the BRH focused on two priorities, which are essential for the award of works by contracting authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">The requirements of EU law will allow for cross-border competition to create a Single European Market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Anti-corruption measures are not only aimed at preventing or at least reducing corruption. They are also intended to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of the procurement rules in both countries and the comparison of these rules reveal information on commonalities and differences which may help both countries to develop their procurement law and its application.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU public procurement rules</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed the EU's requirements for the award of works into national law.</seg>
<seg id="809">This provides an important common basis in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works and the consideration of the essential requirements of competition, the equal treatment of the undertakings involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">The building administrations of both countries have in some cases subject these bids to further administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements for the construction works to be awarded to the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the audits carried out by the Courts of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="813">The building administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints identified when implementing the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">The audits in the Czech Republic have shown, in particular, risks affecting the economic viability of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="815">For example, incomplete service descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in breach of the law. In addition, the cost assessments were usually insufficiently prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the case of transport structures.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">The investigations have not been aimed at uncovering corruption cases,</seg>
<seg id="818">also because the Courts of Auditors do not have the appropriate instruments for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the Courts of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of works and how these requirements are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">The two countries have set different priorities for the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="821">In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition, transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech rules are aimed above all at increasing the transparency of procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of the prevention of corruption apply, which the entire Federal Administration must apply.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of works and are geared to their specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="826">In some cases, the relevant rules specify the way in which the requirements for the prevention of corruption must be taken into account in the course of procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="827">In particular, the BRH considers that the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analyses and adequate controls (in particular the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore does not see any fundamental need for changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of works.</seg>
<seg id="830">The rules on the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Building authorities should further train their employees on the requirements for the prevention of corruption and raise their awareness of this problem even more.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building administrations to freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.</seg>
<seg id="835">Tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should therefore only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against improper interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">NKO</seg>
<seg id="837">The Czech Republic adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which public procurement is the most important component.</seg>
<seg id="838">The Procurement Act and the associated implementing provisions have been substantially amended.</seg>
<seg id="839">The nca's audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, as the contracting authorities must justify the economic viability of the awarding of contracts, the calculation of expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and must properly document and publish all these aspects.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">The NCA and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that EU competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at enabling and promoting cross-border competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous material and ideological damage potential of manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the building administrations in their countries as being called upon to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.</seg>
<seg id="847">The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures can provide a wider scope for competition and significantly reduce the risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="848">Greater distribution of works into lots may also have a favourable effect on bid prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring the correct conduct of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient procurement activities of contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks are carried out by the departments themselves or contractors commissioned by them, with the exception of transport projects.</seg>
<seg id="851">The Courts of Auditors of both countries are concerned to develop the knowledge that is important to them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country, even after the completion of their joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">Both Courts of Auditors also believe that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure the economic award of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the control check</seg>
<seg id="3">Preface</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes are the main source of revenue for public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="5">The activities of the Courts of Auditors should therefore be based on the audit of this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">This applies in particular to VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">This alone causes tax losses of an estimated EUR 100 billion per year in the European Union1.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005, the participants already stressed the need for enhanced cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">This enables the auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and to optimise audit practice.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation as it is harmonised within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2006, for the first time, the Courts of Auditors of both countries examined the VAT in parallel.</seg>
<seg id="12">The relevant audit report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the Courts of Auditors is needed. This will enable a comprehensive assessment of the appropriate measures taken to effectively address VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two Courts of Auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the control audit</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Examination number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of THE USt (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NC), audit</seg>
<seg id="18">Examination objective:</seg>
<seg id="19">- (CZ) Mr President, I would like to The VAT administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities in intergovernmental administrative assistance should be examined.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit was intended to evaluate how the tax administration has implemented the recommendations made by the Courts of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, other examination fields linked to the VAT should be edited.</seg>
<seg id="22">The findings should be compared in order to determine whether tax procedures can be optimised.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audit period was the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period prior to the audit period until the completion of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit</seg>
<seg id="25">The Courts of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a verification check on the administration of the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the previous parallel audit, they had uncovered suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,</seg>
<seg id="27">which made it appropriate to re-examine.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the audit findings, the two Courts of Auditors made recommendations on the management of the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aim of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the suspected cases identified should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also dealt with other issues. These included selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual administrative assistance in the recovery of VAT claims and VAT audits of large firms.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Courts of Auditors have found that:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous audit</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In the first audit, the Courts of Auditors compared the registration procedures for VAT in the two countries and found differences that caused problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Courts of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxpayers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This has also been taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment of Council Regulation No 1798/2003 provides for the addition of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of VAT officers.</seg>
<seg id="38">The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their possible deletion.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Courts of Auditors expected Member States to agree, in accordance with their decision in principle, on appropriate arrangements to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">The latest version of the draft was agreed politically by the Member States in Ecofin.</seg>
<seg id="41">These common rules are no longer included. The two Courts of Auditors regret this.</seg>
<seg id="42">They still consider such rules to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary notifications As a result of the first audit, the Courts of Auditors recommended to the Member States that the Summary Notifications (ZM) should be submitted on a monthly basis in future.</seg>
<seg id="44">The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions shortened the deadline for the submission of the ZM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, implementation did not enter into force until 1 July 2010. It has thus failed to transpose the obligation to pay the ZM monthly into national law in due time.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Data matching of THE VAT pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of procedures for VAT pre-registrations and ZM. The German tax administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to work out possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="49">Work is still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Federal Audit Office will monitor the further development.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level During the first audit, the two auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria and elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="53">Failure to do so will result in fraudsters concentrating on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Courts of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Audit Office focused on The German participation in the "Platform for Risk Management".</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Check of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the first audit, the Courts of Auditors had jointly examined transactions which were doubtful whether they had actually been exported or which had been explained differently by the taxable persons of the two States in the VAT pre-declarations (or VAT declarations) or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Courts of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the verification check.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits carried out by the tax authorities (FAD) of both countries were not yet completed at the time of the completion of the first parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit has shown that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. The respective tax administrations had taken appropriate measures to this end (including subsequent VAT fixing or the prevention of VAT refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">The audit also included high-risk intra-Community transactions between taxable persons in the EU, which were covered by the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is used to identify risky taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States may participate in this scheme on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data under EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the point of view of an active participating State, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">This did not allow information to be obtained as to which suppliers with a German VAT ID would have been classified as highly risky cases.</seg>
<seg id="68">The NKU found both normal transactions and those suspected of VAT fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.</seg>
<seg id="69">FäTs were able to examine high-risk sales only to a limited extent. This was particularly the case in the case of so-called 'missing traders', whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">In case of suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports</seg>
<seg id="71">it is recommended that customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely to monitor the identifyability of the goods and their actual routes of transport within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany and a number of other countries have refused to participate actively in EUROCANET on the grounds that there is not a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Audit Office) found that the German tax administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="74">However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation,</seg>
<seg id="76">created by EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should feed into the planned network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, requests for intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are processed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Federal Audit Office and NKU compared the statistics that both Member States provided to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">These statistics contained inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two Courts of Auditors consider it useful to re-discuss statistics at EU level in order to avoid any further inconsistencies in the future.</seg>
<seg id="84">If this is not done, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">An analysis of detailed data can help the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">Both Courts of Auditors consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should endeavour to achieve at least the average recovery rate.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Commission should support the Member States in this if they so wish.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. USt test for large companies</seg>
<seg id="90">The Courts of Auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large companies in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the tax authorities which they considered important in this context.</seg>
<seg id="92">It became clear that the situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="93">The CZ has a system for the selection of risky cases that incorporates a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss accounts).</seg>
<seg id="94">As a result, the VAT control can be effectively controlled and analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="95">In 2012, a special tax office for large enterprises is to be set up.</seg>
<seg id="96">Germany does not yet have a comparable system. This makes it difficult to control and analyze VAT control as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="97">The German tax administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="98">Various risk management components that are to be improved support the evaluation of this data.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">Division II - State budget revenue and regional divisions IX Pilsen, X'eské Budjovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited between May 2009 and February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="102">Audited bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FECs: Tax Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Béeclav, FA in Doma lice, FA in Hodonin, FA in Hradec Krslové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA , FA in Pilsen, FA Prague 1, FA Prague 4, FA Prague 8, FA in Rakovnék, FA in Sokolov, FA in Tobor, FA in Vysoké Méto, FA in Zlan and FA in Amberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Examination procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:</seg>
<seg id="107">• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. They also conducted interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files from the following FIUs were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Central Finance Office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in the Upper Palatinate, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Special Tax Office Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, discussions were held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Federal Audit Office notified the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors</seg>
<seg id="112">In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both Courts of Auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">In December 2008, the Presidents of both Courts of Auditors signed the agreement on cooperation in parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams informed themselves about the initial results obtained during the preparation of the examination, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on the way forward.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The audit teams exchanged the audit findings gained so far and agreed on the timetable for the preparation of the joint audit report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two Courts of Auditors set out the following topics for their parallel audit: • evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • review of selected intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany, classified as risky; • examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits at large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Examination of the management of VAT in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint audit</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Implementation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxpayers within the EU Supported</seg>
<seg id="124">on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended that the requirements for VAT registration be adapted and that new rules for the deletion of registration in the CZ should be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="125">These amended rules should more effectively reduce the risk of possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="126">In certain cases, it was found that the FA did not delete the VAT registration of taxable persons if they did not fulfil their obligations under Czech Law No 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "USt Law").</seg>
<seg id="127">To date, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige the FÄ to delete it if taxpayers repeatedly do not submit VAT declarations.</seg>
<seg id="128">Under Czech VAT law, the FA may, of its own motion, delete the registration of a taxable person if (a) the taxable person has not carried out any transactions for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for this; (b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; (c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the conditions for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="129">The first examination showed that, due to the existing legal situation, the FA Prague 1 had to delete the VAT registration of 'foreign taxpayers'3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Prague 1 FA often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the time limit could not be adequately implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">Accordingly, the IA is entitled to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if the latter has not provided any taxable or exempt goods or services entitled to deduct in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly submission of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="135">As a result of the initial audit, the Courts of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle for the submission of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The ZM must now be delivered electronically.</seg>
<seg id="138">In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with Section 9(1) of the USt Act are provided to a person registered as liable for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="139">The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the place of supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of data from VAT pre-registrations and ZM to increase the reliability of MIAS data This recommendation related to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">In its ATIS4 system, the Czech tax administration automatically compares data on intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper collection of VAT is essential for the proper functioning of the EU's internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">That is why the fight against VAT fraud is of paramount interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.</seg>
<seg id="148">In it, an external expert estimated the VAT failure for the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006. After analysing the available data, the tax loss for the period in point was estimated at between EUR 90 and 113 billion. This is based on the fact that the EU-25 loses on average 12% of the turnover taxes due to it each year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first audit found that a Member State alone cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS).</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has audited the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).</seg>
<seg id="153">For this purpose, intra-Community transactions carried out by taxpayers within the EU and covered in EUROCANET were selected (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The EUROFISC network aims to optimise administrative assistance in tax matters and to combat VAT fraud more effectively. The cooperation of the competent authorities should be improved in order to identify fraud as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="156">Ecofin Council6 approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.</seg>
<seg id="157">EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="158">The purpose of the system is to identify risky transactions and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxpayers within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers on the basis of a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system itself is constantly being improved.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data given in the questionnaire will now be recorded electronically and will be available for further investigation. They are therefore part of the risk management of registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission had made a proposal8 to amend Regulation 1798/2003. This provided, inter alia, for common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance that it should not fall short of the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly submission of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, a Law9 transposed EU directives into national law was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="173">It contains, inter alia, provisions relating to the monthly supply of the CMR for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="174">will enter into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Match THE data of the VAT pre-notifications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting THE VAT pre-notifications and the ZM</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint federal-state working group has been set up to</seg>
<seg id="178">which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="179">The concept is still being discussed with the countries.</seg>
<seg id="180">In addition, this working group has considered a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community turnover.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level At EU level, relevant information is exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the initiative and initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan by written procedure of 18 October 2006.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the Platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • Risk management tools, • Influencing the behaviour of taxpayers, • Evaluation, • Updating the Risk Management Guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports from the Risk Management Instruments and "Updating the Risk Management Guide" subgroups were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and its deletion in different countries has been dealt with at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amended Council Regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repeal of Regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of the current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">This proposal also includes, among other things, common standards for the registration and erasure of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="192">The questions of registration and deletion are reserved for the national legislation of the EU Member States until further notice.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance that it should not fall short of the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">On the last version of the draft, the Member States reached political agreement in Ecofin on 8 June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="196">It no longer includes common rules for the registration and erasure of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="197">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="198">The two Courts of Auditors regret this. They still consider such rules to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly submission of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="201">With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous audit, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the CMR in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">The Council's RL 2008/117/EC amending RL 2006/112/EC on the common SYSTEM of VAT for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the rate for the levying of the relevant ZM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not fulfil its obligation to pay the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus did not comply with the deadline, while the CZ met EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of THE data of the VAT pre-notifications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT pre-notifications or the ZM</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">The Federal Audit Office will monitor the further development.</seg>
<seg id="208">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech Court of Auditors audited the application of the EUROCANET system to CZ (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">The Bundesrechnungshof focused on the German participation in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Control of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">The first examination examined jointly transactions which had doubts as to whether they had actually been exported or whether discrepancies had been found in the declarations of taxpayers in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="214">For the purpose of the verification check, the two Courts of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany in which the tax assessment by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth EUR 22 686 from a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxable person did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration that the German taxable person did not have a VAT identification number during that period, but only a tax number for intra-German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="218">Through international administrative assistance under Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, under the German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods did not need a VAT identification number in order to benefit from the exemption from intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="219">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the audit carried out by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods of the above mentioned value and at the same time asserting his right to deduct vat of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">A Czech taxable person is alleged to have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">However, he stated that he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not declare them in his VAT statement.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax authorities refused to deal with the request, citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, because the turnover linked to the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech FA was unable to obtain documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax determination was in place.</seg>
<seg id="225">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxable person had invoiced the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxable person acquired the goods from the Slovak taxable person and stated the acquisition in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">A Czech taxpayer is alleged to have purchased a car worth EUR 48 500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, he did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, he had not made a USt statement since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question with 0 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information provided from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA requested the taxable person in March 2007 to file a retrospective tax return, which the taxpayer failed to do.</seg>
<seg id="232">The audit found that the IA had carried out further audits in this tax case in 2007. It found that the car in question had been sold by the taxable person to a used car dealer in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech IA carried out an assessment for the tax period December 2004, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="234">The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings on the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be uncollectible.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">A Czech taxpayer is said to have delivered new vehicles (cars) totalling EUR 198 167 to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="238">The reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 stated that a tax criminal case was pending in Germany against the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="239">The audit carried out by the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Audit Office) showed that, after the conclusion of the proceedings, there was evidence of the Involvement of the German taxpayer in fraud.</seg>
<seg id="240">The acquisition of goods within the Community was subject to capital taxation in the amount of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information provided by the German tax authorities, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional VAT of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">Czech taxable person A is alleged to have purchased a machine worth a total of EUR 58 000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="246">In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxable person allegedly supplied the Czech taxpayer B with a machine worth EUR 88 027. However, B denied the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with an established office in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="248">Czech taxable person A did not state the acquisition of the goods by that German taxable person in its VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="249">The German FA's reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxable person had not made an intra-Community supply of a machine worth EUR 58 000, but a delivery within the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the inspection, the Bundesrechnungshof found that the intra-Community supply of the machine was classified as a domestic delivery after the completion of an audit and that the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person allegedly delivered goods worth EUR 11 600 to a Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which inadmissibly identified acquisitions from another Member State, including purchases in the above-mentioned amount.</seg>
<seg id="255">The Bundesrechnungshof (Bundesrechnungshof) found that, after receiving a reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German Faecantite corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and set an additional VAT of EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="256">Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an examination is under way.</seg>
<seg id="257">The ZM of the German taxable person has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxable person who has surrendered the ZM can also correct it.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax authorities in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the question of the purchase of a car worth EUR 47 400 by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">Following an examination for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA set the Czech tax able to pay czK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the czech taxpayer's purchase of the car.</seg>
<seg id="261">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech VAT officer had been deleted because he had not complied with his tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="262">The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxable person has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax ruling.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person supplied goods with a total value of EUR 33 205 to a Czech taxable person, but this did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="266">The Audit of the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA was investigating the reasons for the discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer repeatedly issued retrospective VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of acquisitions of CZK 134 273 in the period 3 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this on the grounds that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated and accepted the VAT declarations made.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person had delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to a Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA verified the actual value of the supply.</seg>
<seg id="273">The German reply to that request sent three invoices which showed a total value of EUR 31 998 for the delivered goods, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="274">According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer had submitted a retrospective VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period in January 2007 following repeated warnings from the FA.</seg>
<seg id="275">By that declaration, the taxable person simultaneously asserted his right to deduct. Its tax liability for the tax period in question therefore remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures for the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the tax authorities in the CZ or Germany had taken appropriate measures (including subsequent VAT fixing or the prevention of VAT refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be an important source of information to identify risky taxpayers in the Member State of acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the competent I.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has incorporated information on sales and taxable suppliers that are considered to be risky into the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,</seg>
<seg id="283">entered into EUROCANET by the tax administrations of other Member States, either as suppliers or purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="284">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data via EUROCANET, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit identified both normal transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">In the cases in question, the FÄ evicted information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,</seg>
<seg id="288">e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="289">• The FA did not find any suspicion of risky transactions when examining the early warning information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The taxpayers concerned were continuously monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• The FAWas in the audits of the transactions at risk failed to prove infringements of the taxable and VAT calculation rules on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relations with letterbox companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the FARs and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The competent FADs reviewed most of the risky taxpayers and transactions referred to in EUROCANET early warning notifications.</seg>
<seg id="294">However, their ability to check risky sales, especially so-called "missing traders", is limited.</seg>
<seg id="295">In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly prove that the taxable person acted fraudulently.</seg>
<seg id="296">Stricter requirements for the registration of taxpayers for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in the deletion of registrations would help to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="297">Taxable persons involved in fraudulent carousel transactions may register for VAT purposes in order to fake fictitious supplies of goods throughout the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to other taxpayers, with which they then assert unjustified claims for deduction.</seg>
<seg id="298">In the event of suspicion of carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is advisable that customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to be able to track the actual nature of the goods and their actual routes of transport within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="299">Member States may participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be addressed by setting up a EUROFISC network with compulsory participation.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Findings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available to the Federal Central Tax Office, including those from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were verified.</seg>
<seg id="304">Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">The reason for this is that "from the point of view of the Federal Government,</seg>
<seg id="307">there is no unquestionable legal basis that would allow the tax secrecy existing in Germany to be blawed.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET."12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German FUs receive control notices on the direct business relations of the taxable persons registered with them with companies from other EU countries covered by EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German IA is not informed whether the company from the other EU Member State referred to above has business relations with an undertaking established in another Member State, which is also in business with the German company from the control communication.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From an active participant's point of view, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate.</seg>
<seg id="314">Accordingly, the test had to be carried out differently in this area.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, significant differences in the success of the detection of VAT fraud could not be found. This is because EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, the tax administrations of both countries have a variety of other tools in place to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13, which created EUROFISC, a network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared between Member States and incorporated into this network at European level.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="320">The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for exemption from intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">Legislation on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:</seg>
<seg id="324">Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures which form part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures which form part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, levies and customs duties and vat on VAT and certain excise duties, and</seg>
<seg id="326">Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed implementing rules for certain articles of Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain charges, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">The CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308/EEC by Law No 252/2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it too had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, an amendment to the aforementioned law was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, legislative amendment No 191/2004 on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new relevant legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annexes to this Regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the Regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the original.</seg>
<seg id="332">The main principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. The principle of reciprocity applies;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. Mutual assistance shall always be provided only on request and upon fulfilment of all conditions;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. Mutual assistance shall not cover claims which are considered to be a criminal sanction in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. The procedure for intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. Mutual assistance shall be provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. The principle of exhaustion applies: the requesting State shall use all means to which it is entitled under national law to recover the claim.</seg>
<seg id="340">Law No 191/2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: the provision of information, the notification of legal acts and the actual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="341">Outgoing request procedures to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The competent IA shall transmit the request for information, the request for notification of acts or the recovery request, together with the documents concerned, electronically to the Relevant Financial Directorate to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall arrange for the request to be translated into the language concerned, scan it with all annexes and transmit it via the communication network or the common interface CCN/CSI to the competent tax authority of the State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="344">A request for recovery assistance must meet the following condition: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">The Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.</seg>
<seg id="348">If it decides not to grant the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the Directive on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="349">The relevant notification shall be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance shall verify that the request meets all legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="351">It is then to submit the request to the relevant IA through the relevant financial directorate. If the recovery request is granted, the IA shall, inter alia, determine the debtor's financial situation, e.g. by extracts from the land register, inquire about existing bank accounts and register vehicle registration with the registration body.</seg>
<seg id="352">At the end of six months from the date of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance shall inform the CZ of the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="353">The requesting authority shall also be informed if the taxable persons concerned are not reachable and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="354">All sums successfully recovered shall be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech I, which is involved in recovery, may, with the consent of the requesting State, agree on the hourly claim or payment in instalments.</seg>

<seg id="357">the requesting State.</seg>
<seg id="358">In particular in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance delayed the cz's received recovery requests.</seg>
<seg id="359">The same was true of the forwarding of the recovery requests made by the Czech FADs to the competent authority in the requested State.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the Law on Intergovernmental Assistance for the Recovery of Claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of the confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="361">The situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">Pursuant to Section 13(4) of Law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ produces statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This shall include the number of requests submitted in the previous year and the requests received for information, notification of acts and recovery, including the amount of the claims in question.</seg>
<seg id="364">On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission prepares its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit revealed that in 2008 the Finance Ministry understated the claims by EUR 5 250 000 to the CZ. The reason for this was the incorrect indication of the amount of a VAT claim submitted in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point when converting the claim from Czech crowns into euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was then reflected in the European Commission's statistics.</seg>
<seg id="367">Details of mutual recovery assistance are shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal basis for intergovernmental administrative assistance in tax matters is The Commission's Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive)14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178/2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">For the purpose of better legibility and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codified Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197666, the provisions of which had been substantially amended on several occasions.</seg>
<seg id="371">It regulates, inter alia, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and late payment surcharges.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC)17 of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">Enforcement proceedings in Germany are regulated by the Tax Code (AO).</seg>
<seg id="374">Paragraph 117(2) of the AO provides that the tax authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and the laws of the European Communities applicable to national law and by virtue of the EC Official Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of the AO (Sections 249-346) contains the legislation on enforcement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative actions of the tax authorities shall, in particular, govern the enforcement and enforcement order.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Tax Authorities of the Länder on the principles of administrative assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Office for Taxation18.</seg>
<seg id="378">General conditions for the admissibility of a recovery request are:</seg>
<seg id="379">• The legal requirements must be met (Sections 251, 254 AO).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All recovery funds available domestically have been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• The claims for which administrative assistance is requested are indisputable.</seg>
<seg id="382">• The period between the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became unchallengeable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The claim must be at least EUR 1 500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Proceedings for outgoing requests to other EU Member States The German requests for the recovery of back taxes are forwarded by the enforcement authorities of the FÄ through the competent central authority and the Federal Central Tax Office of the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.</seg>
<seg id="385">The details are set out in the intergovernmental assistance leaflet for tax collection (recovery) of 19 January 200419.</seg>
<seg id="386">This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new Recovery Directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">The request, together with annexes, is forwarded electronically by the IA to the central authority.</seg>
<seg id="388">The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If not, the request will be returned to the IA concerned.</seg>

<seg id="403">A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between the CZ and Germany were selected for the audit. The following are ten cases in which, inter alia,</seg>
<seg id="404">The following was found:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT debts from a Czech taxpayer in 2004 and 2005 for a total amount of EUR 3 883 (CZK 109 820).</seg>
<seg id="407">It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent IA.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxable person with a property lien.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since the imputed immovable property was not sufficient to pay the entire tax liability, an instalment payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was concluded with the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31 August 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. As a result, the taxpayer had in the meantime paid tax debts in the amount of CZK 49 600 (as of 25 August 2009).</seg>
<seg id="411">The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on 28 August 2009, a further CZK 3 000 was transferred.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling EUR 180 869 (CZK 4 434 915).</seg>
<seg id="414">It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent IA.</seg>
<seg id="415">After reviewing bank deposits, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable property, the IA found that the debtor did not have pfentable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Investigations on the ground also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German Tax Administration on 16 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT, together with interest and fees totalling EUR 3 139 (CZK 84 846).</seg>
<seg id="421">It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent IA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now paid the debt.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had paid his debt in full in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the debt was also settled in the CZ in the context of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Because of the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the I, the tax debt was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by recovery by the responsible Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the Bundesrechnungshof, it was found that the amount recovered would be offset against the tax liability arising from another proceeding, amounting to EUR 6 649 and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only one recovery request for the company concerned in the amount of EUR 3 139. The recovery request of EUR 6 649 could not be found there.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling EUR 39 957 = CZK 956 654.</seg>
<seg id="429">It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent IA.</seg>
<seg id="430">The recovery procedure was initiated on 1 June 2009. A decision was adopted on the attachment of the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the IA, the debtor agreed with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech FA, the debtor had in the past been willing to pay EUR 250 per month, but the competent German FA did not agree.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxpayer agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax for 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling EUR 113 444 = CZK 3 116 304.</seg>
<seg id="437">It was not until 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to FA Prague 1, which is authorised to deal with tax cases of non-CZ taxpayers; on the basis of the available address, a local competent IA could not be determined.</seg>
<seg id="438">During its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008 stating that the debtor's income was EUR 4 704. However, it was unable to issue an enforcement order because the recovery request had been received after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to impeach the debtor's assets at credit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of a VAT debt, together with procedural costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.</seg>
<seg id="443">It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of EUR 17 700 = CZK 439 226, which was recovered by attachment to the accounts, through the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="445">A conversion error was detected during the verification of the recovered amounts.</seg>
<seg id="446">The amount to be contributed was CONVERTED at the exchange rate of 1 euro = CZK 25,065 at the exchange rate of CZK 146 223 742, but a comma error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct amount to be recovered was EUR 5 833 782.</seg>
<seg id="448">As a result, a request for recovery was too low by EUR 5 250 404.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery on the grounds of a VAT debt, together with interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer, totalling CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.</seg>
<seg id="451">It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="452">On 4 February 2009, the German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">Taking into account the significant reduction in the Company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability. On 8 April 2009 - EUR 4 600, on 6 May 2009 -3 000 and on 16 June 2009 - EUR 2 500.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were transferred to the account of the competent IA in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the Ia by 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling EUR 398 653 = CZK 9 832 779; This included, inter alia, real estate transfer tax.</seg>
<seg id="458">It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="459">In a letter from the German Tax Administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009, the request was returned.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax authorities justified this on the ground that the real estate transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Articles 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">In addition, Article 2 (g) relates to liabilities alike on income and property.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and property which are not mentioned in Articles 1, (3) and 4 of Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new recovery request to the German tax administration, which would no longer include the real estate transfer tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but the arrears with the VAT, corporation tax and income tax.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent IA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328.</seg>
<seg id="467">The VAT debt was CZK 1 133 967.</seg>
<seg id="468">It was not until 18 April 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax administration</seg>
<seg id="469">and it was not until 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech FA the reply of 9 July 2007,</seg>
<seg id="470">according to which, on 11 June 2007, the German FA issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account. The Bank stated that it was not in a business relationship with that taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="471">The request for the German tax administration was therefore deemed to have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for VAT debts totalling CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The relevant Financial Directorate made the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German tax administration on 15 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Prior to the submission of the request, the Czech FA enforced the tax claim by attachment of the accounts to banks and salary attachment and by debiting a property.</seg>
<seg id="477">Prior to the request for recovery, a request for information was sent to the German tax authorities on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">According to the reply of 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer was domiciled in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities in the amount of EUR 8 437. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the recovery request and did not forward this to the competent Czech FA until 12 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="479">According to that date, the tax liability in Germany is unrecoverable due to the debtor's insolvency.</seg>
<seg id="480">No property had been found and the income from non-self-employed activities was already the subject of other enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German tax administration therefore considered the request to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of recovery, all EU Member States are subject to the requirements of EU law for intergovernmental assistance.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The Federal Court of Accounts and the NA have compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">There were discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States compile their statistics with greater care.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite the increased number of requests for mutual assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics have narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both Courts of Auditors consider it useful to re-examine the statistics at EU level in order to avoid the remaining inconsistencies in the future.</seg>
<seg id="490">If this is not done, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the Courts of Auditors consider that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the nature of the claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of the amounts recovered per Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">By analysing the statistics provided by the Member States in more detail, the Commission could help Member States assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Courts of Auditors are in favour of the low rate of At least the average recovery rate within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.</seg>
<seg id="495">The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the competent FA, in particular in 2006 and 2007, delayed.</seg>
<seg id="496">The same applies to the recovery requests made by the Czech FAD.</seg>
<seg id="497">The investigation showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance insofared in law No 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance in so far as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from the confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 VAT audit for large companies</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 VAT audit for large companies in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General</seg>
<seg id="501">The taxation procedure for large holdings is subject to the same rules as other taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="502">The audit of large enterprises is regulated by Czech Law No. 337/1992, the "Tax and Fee Management Act".</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons established to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the relevant tax period is at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.</seg>
<seg id="504">The taxable person is classified as a large holding on the basis of the level of turnover according to the income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time for 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A natural or legal person is no longer held as a large holding for the purposes of turnover taxation if, in three consecutive tax periods, its net turnover during the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period for which the conditions were met for the first time in accordance with the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="506">A taxable person may be removed from the list of large holdings only if at least one type of tax has been previously assessed for a tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">By the end of 2009, all large holdings were audited at least every five years.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the proper determination and collection of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="509">The FA audits should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="510">Large taxable holdings were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services set up by a total of 13 FAEEs.</seg>
<seg id="511">A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the instructions of the Head of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition, it also examined</seg>
<seg id="513">Taxable persons with unusual and special business activities and</seg>
<seg id="514">those whose audit required a high degree of expertise and time.</seg>
<seg id="515">Taxpayers with complex location distribution and organisational structure are also audited,</seg>
<seg id="516">Taxable persons suspected of large-scale tax evasion</seg>
<seg id="517">and taxpayers belonging to chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified deduction.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information on the number of audits carried out by the FA Special Audit Offices and the additional tax results of these audits are given in Table No 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No 531/1990 for the regional tax authorities. In particular, it is proposed to set up a special tax office with national jurisdiction for selected taxpayers (legal persons established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 VAT audit for large companies in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General</seg>
<seg id="522">The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. Audits are subject to the general rules • the tax classification (AO), • the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and • the Audit Regulations (BpO).</seg>
<seg id="523">There are also work aids.</seg>
<seg id="524">Delivery order</seg>
<seg id="525">The provisions of Sections 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 -External Examination" contain, in particular, rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its scope, the distribution of responsibilities, the form and content of the audit notice, audit ingesity, the duty of the taxpayer to cooperate and the conditions for final interviews, as well as for the transmission of the audit report.</seg>
<seg id="526">External tests are carried out by the competent FATs (Section 195 AO).</seg>
<seg id="527">In accordance with Section 5 paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with Section 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits of the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and extent of such participation shall be agreed between the authorities involved.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office may require that certain establishments designated by it be audited at a given time.</seg>
<seg id="530">In this case, it may lay down rules for the external audit of such taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="531">In accordance with Article 108 paragraph 7 gg., the Audit Regulations (BpO 2000) was issued with the approval of the Federal Council.</seg>
<seg id="532">It applies to external audits carried out by the state tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Pursuant to Section 3 of the BpO, enterprises are regularly classified in size classes.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large companies must be subjected to a follow-up test (section 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">Pursuant to point 33.1 BpO, each competent tax authority must keep a group directory within the meaning of the provision.</seg>
<seg id="536">Work aids for administration</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the following work aids have been issued for the administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">• "Unified Manual for THE VAT Special Examination";</seg>
<seg id="539">• Vat-country-online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with guidance on the use of the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;</seg>
<seg id="540">• Work aids for difficult and special situations.</seg>
<seg id="541">• Central database for the storage and evaluation of VAT fraud cases and development of risk profiles -ZAUBER;</seg>
<seg id="542">Taxpayers are classified in size classes. These are based on criteria such as turnover and profit, with limits varying from one branch of business to another.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">The values shall be reviewed every three years and fixed for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of enterprises - not only large enterprises - is regularly observed (last cut-off date: 1 January 2010).</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, large enterprises must be fully audited.</seg>
<seg id="547">The examinations are announced and usually extend to the VAT,</seg>
<seg id="548">that is, the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income tax, corporation tax, business and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT can be audited either by auditors or special auditors.</seg>
<seg id="550">The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of each country.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">The BpO 2000 assumes three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes on which a company has been assessed are subject to the audit.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of VAT audits for large companies</seg>
<seg id="555">As agreed, neither Court of Auditors examined individual cases. They have examined the question of how the tax administrations proceed in the VAT audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="556">Using a questionnaire, they collected information from the tax authorities which is essential for the audit of large enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and evaluations for the VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?</seg>
<seg id="558">Especially:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there statistics or records of the extent to which a distinction is made between VAT fraud and general VAT testing?</seg>
<seg id="560">CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration makes no distinction between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there statistics or records of the timeliness of the tests?</seg>
<seg id="563">CZ: Information on the timeliness of checks of intra-Community acquisitions of selected VAT payers is recorded in the ATIS system;</seg>
<seg id="564">the same applies to information on the start and end of the IA's audit.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the statistics for auditors aggregated at federal level contain only information on the so-called average last audit period (year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not provide an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.</seg>
<seg id="567">USt special auditors focus on the last VAT assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.</seg>
<seg id="568">The statistics for special auditors kept at the federal level do not contain any information on the size class of the audited establishment.</seg>
<seg id="569">• Are there statistics or records of the nature of the additional result; e.g. subdivided by:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. genuine additional result (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general VAT rate)</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. false additional result (e.g. transfer/postponement of a situation which cannot be criticised under VAT law to another tax period)</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)</seg>
<seg id="573">Cz:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the additional tax result, broken down by tax type, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (on-site investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Irrespective of this, the amount of additional payments and the incoming payments are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by tax type. However, no distinction is made between tax liabilities arising from a tax return and those arising from the IA's audit actions.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the statistics for auditors and SPECIAL auditors summarised at federal level do not differ according to the above criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Most of the tax authorities where local surveys were carried out also did not differentiate in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are results-rich test fields recorded?</seg>
<seg id="581">CZ: Yes, the IA can select audit cases based on criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and SPECIAL auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="585">Accordingly, auditors and tax investigators of the Länder are to enter the additional tax result they have achieved in ZAUBER if a certain threshold is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, additional information shall be provided, e.g. on the origin of the VAT result obtained.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">Cz:</seg>
<seg id="589">- large taxable companies have unjustifiably benefited from deduction of input tax on supplies and supplies purchased,</seg>
<seg id="590">• not used for an entrepreneurial activity in accordance with Section 72 (1) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="591">• used for representation expenses in accordance with Section 75 (3) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="592">• due to invoices that do not meet the requirements of Section 73 (1) CZ UStG</seg>
<seg id="593">- large taxable holdings have refrained from registering the VAT to be paid in Section 21 (1) of the CZ UStG.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and SPECIAL auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="596">Findings on VAT from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, the Federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database in which auditors and tax investigators of the Länder are to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration analyse audit fields that are rich in results and draw conclusions for strategic management?</seg>
<seg id="599">CZ: Yes, for example, national audits are carried out with regard to high-risk goods and sectors.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and SPECIAL auditors do not provide information on particularly "productive" audit fields.</seg>
<seg id="602">There were differing views on the analysis of such information, the usefulness and manner in which it was continued to be used.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some senior financial directorates make such information available to the FA, but it is up to the FA whether or not to use it.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the system.</seg>
<seg id="606">The CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases on the basis of a wide range of information.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT audits in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In the CZ, the establishment of a special tax office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="610">Accordingly, it is more difficult to carry out these tasks in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="611">The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="612">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of the information in VAT pre-notifications or VAT declarations as well as inspection instructions, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.</seg>
<seg id="614">Appropriate management processes and risk management systems should be put in place to reduce VAT revenue losses while increasing the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs.</seg>

<seg id="616">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFBlank</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors has proved its worth.</seg>
<seg id="619">This has enabled the necessary knowledge to be gained on the systems used in both countries: in particular: • intra-Community turnover, • risk management at the VAT, in particular with regard to the selection of risky transactions, • recovery of VAT claims and • VAT audit of large enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="620">The audit revealed differences in VAT fraud detection strategies and in the systems discussed above.</seg>
