<seg id="3">High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and increasing living standards in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economical passenger and freight transport is an important task for the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="6">It requires a great deal of organisational, technical and financial effort.</seg>
<seg id="7">When building and expanding a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures, the construction of the transport infrastructure is complex.</seg>
<seg id="9">When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources through careful action and decision-making and use them for other useful purposes.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of state auditing authorities is to identify deficiencies that stand in the way of optimum economy, efficiency and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also make suggestions for improvement for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) and the Nejvygl ä u ß t carried out parallel audits of expenditure for the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by the two states.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooperation with the NK K ä mpfer enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the course of the cooperation with the BRH, the NK received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the planning progress, the completion date was finally set for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the tendering process, the Road and Highway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor assured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the RMD had to accept significant additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint audit activity, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.</seg>
<seg id="24">A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square meter.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis showed that the border bridge was the most expensive among the major bridges with lengths of over 100 m.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was also due to the price increase as a result of the delays in awarding contracts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The comparison of the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">In future audits of the economic viability of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH and NK Kr ä fte can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both courts of auditors recommend standardizing bridge structures and carrying out composite and special steel structures only where prestressed concrete structures are inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The examination process was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report deals with parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The focus of the audit was on the economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel tests were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the NK K K ä ufer in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The NK ä r examined the economy, economy and effectiveness of the expenditure for the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway in the amount of approx. CZK 20 billion gross (approx. €690 million).</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million will come from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005, independently of the parallel tests with the NK K K ö rper.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of the approximately €670 million for the construction of all three sections of the A 17, €277 million will be co-financed by the European Fund (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Corridor IV Dresden - Central and Southeast Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,</seg>
<seg id="43">The A17 from the border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the inspection, the border sections of the motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">The crossing of a landscape protection area in the Bohemian Central Uplands is planned.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the volume of traffic in 2008 in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will amount to 22,940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 25,000 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a contract for the merger of the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border by building a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since both countries are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction project represented an important aspect of the parallel audits of both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and NK Kl ä ge</seg>
<seg id="53">From the middle of 2005, the two courts of auditors jointly considered cooperation in the audit of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.</seg>
<seg id="58">There was no opportunity for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The NK did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The NK ü nstler also had to check the effectiveness of the expenditure by examining the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which were to ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">After preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courts of auditors concluded an agreement on 4 January 2006 on the coordination of the audits of the Prague-Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="64">In the course of 2006, the auditors of both audit institutions met at intervals of about six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for examining the bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">The ongoing exchange of information was essential to the cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH focused on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the award procedures, the NK mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis of financial control and thus also the way in which the two courts of auditors complete their audits differ.</seg>
<seg id="69">For this reason, both authorities drew up separate national reports on their audit results.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report takes into account the results of the two parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communication agreement in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.</seg>
<seg id="74">Later, they mutually postponed the date to the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as the contractor for the construction project.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany is contributing 42.13% to the bridge construction.</seg>
<seg id="77">Initially, the RMD provided a prestressed concrete structure for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, however, RMD agreed with its German partner to build a steel composite structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">They justified this decision with the possible reduction of the number of pillar pairs from seven to five and the associated ecological benefits for the floodplain.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had shown the steel composite structure to be the more cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, this was based on a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite structure of only 397 m,</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award process, the RMD made serious mistakes,</seg>
<seg id="85">By inadequately preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.</seg>
<seg id="86">These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the evaluation commission and the director general of the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="87">A losing bidder challenged the outcome of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation by the Czech antitrust office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a result, the summer construction season following the offer review in 2004 was lost and the total construction time available was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, resulting in a significant price increase.</seg>
<seg id="91">The measures offered included the double assembly of the superstructures, the change of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the original steel grade.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel - whose higher costs of around €4 million were borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time provided for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the offer price of around €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and other additions will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">Excluding price management, costs are currently around €25.9 million net (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both courts examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges that were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, because there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="101">A precise definition of the price concept was important in the preparation of this part of the examination.</seg>
<seg id="102">For the comparison of the bridge prices, both courts of auditors agreed on detailed specifications, for example: To use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="103">(The VAT rates in the Czech Republic and in Germany are different and may change), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion (29 CZK = 1 €).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of various types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and various sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">To ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.</seg>
<seg id="106">The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">Concrete bridges were by far the most common on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The study showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): The larger the bridge, the lower the square meter price.</seg>
<seg id="110">The correlation between price and size is more pronounced for German bridges than for Czech bridges (see figures below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two bridges on the A 17 and four bridges on the D 8 were identified at a significantly higher price.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges were determined partly by a method for detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified based on the distance to the regression curve).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the respective high price must be determined in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">This could be due, for example, to inefficient administrative action, but also to environmental protection requirements or other legitimate reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length indicated that Czech concrete bridges are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">This was also supported by the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">During joint discussions, two reasons for this situation were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="122">This also allows medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.</seg>
<seg id="124">Orders of this magnitude cannot be managed by medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge structures built is greater than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the NK K ä rke noted that the construction of bridges is determined long before construction begins,</seg>
<seg id="128">Already at the submission of the application for planning approval by the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this point, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, cost-effectiveness plays a minor role in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">Only a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would have made it possible to reach a final conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have gone beyond the scope of this review.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D8 and A17.</seg>
<seg id="132">The prices for the tunnels on the D8 are about twice as high as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The significant price differences may be the result of underdeveloped competition for tunnels in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow generalizing conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden - Prague motorway</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government approved the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The plan was to gradually expand the D 8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section 0805 was to be built through the Bohemian Central Uplands before section 0807 near the border.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic is financing the D8 under the programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">The programme number 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 Prague motorway - W ä rst ä nstz nad Labem - Czech-German border" defines two objectives:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">As a national goal: To improve the connection between Prague and st i nad Labem;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">As an international destination: The connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.</seg>
<seg id="147">The programme envisaged completion of the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Uplands in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The NK stated that the planning approval decision had already been issued for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Uplands.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental associations have sued against this decision.</seg>
<seg id="151">A final judgment is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="152">Compared to the schedule provided for in the programme documentation, a delay of several years in the completion of section no. 0805 could not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the completion date of construction phase No. 0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result, the construction of the border section did not meet the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD subjected the border-near section no. 0807 of the D 8 and section no. 0805 through the Bohemian Central Uplands to an economic feasibility study between 1999 and 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The investment costs for both sections no. 0805 and no. 0807 were approximately €639 million.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the economic feasibility study (EIRR = internal interest rate)</seg>
<seg id="158">Variant Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 22 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic feasibility study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Central Uplands will be under traffic at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the test, it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Uplands would not be opened on the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of December 31, 2005, the costs of both sections amounted to €897 million excluding VAT, which is 27.4% higher than the 2001 profitability assessment.</seg>
<seg id="168">In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different, more complex route, which would affect the profitability of the project.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic analysis showed that the construction of both motorway sections is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, a study on detour routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Uplands assumes a traffic volume of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="171">A higher volume of traffic on the routes, which are to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Uplands, is likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic feasibility study.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D8 will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the section of the D 8 near the border is therefore uneconomical.</seg>
<seg id="174">There were also cost increases in the construction of the A 17, as in the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the macroeconomic assessment for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for transport assumed investment costs of around €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">This resulted in a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit / cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">In the years 2003 to 2005, the BRH examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway independently of the parallel tests carried out with the NK K ä mpfer.</seg>
<seg id="179">He noted that the authority responsible for the permit required an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the audit, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the superfluity of the landscape tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="181">As a result, €10 million in construction costs and €150,000 in annual operating costs were avoided.</seg>
<seg id="182">When examining the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was inadequately prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">During the planning phase, the road construction administration did not record the condition of the rock on the surface of the D ö lzschen wall, as it was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">Only when the tunnelling reached the wall did it catch up.</seg>
<seg id="186">It turned out that the rock was more weathered than assumed in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">Elaborate measures such as anchorages, injections and rockfall protection nets for around €3.3 million were necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional services that were already required, such as securing the D ö lzschener Wand, but also for those that would not have been necessary if the construction preparation had been flawless.</seg>
<seg id="189">These include expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the tunnelling team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the construction time extension (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million is not offset by any permanent added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">The BRH took this and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to better exercise its specialist supervision of major road construction measures.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, it should insist that the road construction authorities introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Advantages of the cooperation for BRH and NK ä rzte The cooperation met the expectations of both auditors.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both audit institutions developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful for future audits.</seg>
<seg id="196">The NK found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadways of the D 8 are no different from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of both audit institutions involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience that will be useful in future audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Preface</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the courts of auditors have the power to audit all public finances.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration requires the courts of auditors to have the power to audit tax collection as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Organisation of European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for auditing public revenues.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national audit institutions can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit institutions of other states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As an example, the audit of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.</seg>
<seg id="11">Cooperation between the authorities is needed to combat such crimes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Auditors in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea for an audit of VAT and the MIAS system arose at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the course of thorough preparation, the participating audit institutions first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the evaluation of the available information, we selected the test subjects for the examination planning.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (especially the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only help to improve the work of the financial administration, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>

<seg id="20">Reference number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Subject of examination:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) VAT administration after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(De) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004</seg>
<seg id="24">The Commission's audit objective:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the area of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as the "EC") with free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">(De) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to remedy them.</seg>
<seg id="28">VAT information exchange system The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NK K K ä ufte") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the utilization of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the tax administrations and the comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two states.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period covered the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two auditors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the focus on the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of tax receipts, tax returns and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="35">The audit also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is the exceeding of the turnover threshold specified in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, tax authorities only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, the tax payer receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purposes of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German tax authorities want to make significant intra-Community transactions, they must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="42">As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules within the EC should be standardised (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route runs through Germany, is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic the tax authorities only have to file valid VAT returns for tax periods during the year (month or quarter), tax authorities in Germany (monthly or quarterly)</seg>
<seg id="49">VAT pre-registrations and filing a VAT return after the end of the calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="50">In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax authorities in Germany have to submit the VAT pre-declarations electronically.</seg>
<seg id="51">The introduction of electronic VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="52">4) Summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="53">While the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the tax authorities (F Ä), German tax authorities have to submit the summary reports to the CLO2.</seg>
<seg id="54">Accordingly, the information from the summary reports will be available to the F Ä in the Czech Republic as soon as they are submitted.</seg>
<seg id="55">The information from the summary reports will only be available to German F Ä after processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="56">To combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="57">The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of sales and the update of MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="58">This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">When requests for information are received, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor processing times.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German financial administration completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the specified period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German CLO constantly monitor the deadlines (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The NKK and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, the two courts examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions between Czech and German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="69">Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The Court of Auditors found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the F Ä used the information gained in the international exchange of information and reassessed the VAT liability of the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the tax authorities either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not report the purchase of goods in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the F Ä could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used due to different legal requirements in the two Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="76">A number of cases were uncovered in which tax inspectors incorrectly reported sales in their summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the clerks (the F Ä) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="79">Examination procedure in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 F Ä Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadal ä n, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Th ä u inec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The college of the NK K ä rke approved the audit findings on April 23, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Examination procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the audit area traffic taxes and employees of the associated P Ä B Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase, the actual test began in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NK authorities, the BRH had to announce the examination to several federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was conducted in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files from the following departments were included in the audit:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, M ü hlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, F ü rstenfeldbruck, Munich corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, K ö ln-Mitte, K ö ln-Porz, K ö ln-S ü d, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-S ü d, Dresden II, Freischopau and Leipzig.</seg>
<seg id="92">Discussions were also held with the F Ä Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, D ü sseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">The test results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two auditors</seg>
<seg id="95">Prior to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both audit institutions took place.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the tax administration, the VAT legislation and the VAT administration system in the other country.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was developed and the following examination topics for the parallel examinations were determined: 1.</seg>
<seg id="100">Registration of tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">International passenger transport by bus - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the approach of tax officials in processing requests for information and reviewing selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. Risk management in the VAT area.</seg>
<seg id="110">At a meeting in December 2006 to coordinate the further examination of the NK and the BRH, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel examinations already achieved.</seg>

<seg id="118">An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months will be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (apply 94 (1) of Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter "Act No. 235 / 2004").</seg>
<seg id="119">The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a tax liability if it has exceeded the application deadline for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who provides VAT services or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT, must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other requirements specified in Act No. 235 / 2004.</seg>
<seg id="122">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the requirements specified in the law can voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="123">The registration procedure in accordance with Law No. 337 / 1992 begins with the receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer.</seg>
<seg id="124">If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you must specify in your application the deadline from which you apply for registration as a VAT package.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all attachments.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="127">If the tax official has verified that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notification about the registration and the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="128">In the notification, the tax officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for VAT and the assessment period for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">The assessment period is the calendar quarter, unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached at least CZK 10,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="130">If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the tax officer of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.</seg>
<seg id="133">The tax payer must indicate the tax number in all communications (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Act No. 235 / 2004, concerning the issuance of tax documents) 3.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification sign.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as this is determined by a special law. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions in section 33 (12) of Law No. 337 / 1992).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligations despite the corresponding request by the tax officer, the local tax officer must register him ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="137">This will also be communicated to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur registered for a business activity receives a tax number for any type of tax on his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="139">This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on January 1, 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the VAT law, the tax officer may not require the tax payer to register up to 10% of the proceeds from the tax payable turnover, which the person concerned has unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a tax payer, until the date on which the registration as a tax payer was made by order of the tax officer (Law No. 235 / 2004).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount fixed in this way is considered a tax payment within the meaning of Act No. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VAT beneficiary can be deleted for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of the registration at the request of the tax authorities, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (registration 106 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).</seg>
<seg id="145">A tax beneficiary may request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Cancellation of the registration ex officio (106 (7) of Law No. 235 / 2004) if: A) the tax authorities did not provide any services for a period of 12 consecutive months and did not inform the tax officer of the reasons for this, b) the tax authorities did not fulfil their obligations under Law No. 235 / 2004, c) the previous tax authorities did not meet the requirements for tax payments.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Tax resident without legal domicile, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have his legal domicile, place of business or place of business in the Czech Republic or a tax resident foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes tax resident with the provision of the relevant service.</seg>
<seg id="148">He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.</seg>
<seg id="149">He is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT IDs assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first tax-exempt service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became void on the day of the first tax-exempt service provision in the Czech Republic according to Law No. 235 / 2004.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the case of retroactive registration, the FA Prague 1 must require the entrepreneurs concerned to provide proof of performance (invoices or written explanations).</seg>
<seg id="152">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the FA Prague 1 has to request the submission of the performance-based contract documents.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of January 31 of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or declarations and to pay tax.</seg>
<seg id="155">During the examination of the NKK, it turned out that in the case of filing a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, which are decisive for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of tax authorities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In accordance with the provisions of the tax code 137, 138 AO, each business must be registered with the municipality and / or the responsible tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">This registration must be made no later than one month after the start of business.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the responsible tax office determines that a business activity has started but has not been registered, it can also register the tax beneficiary ex officio retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Tax authorities in Germany, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are required to register for Zwekke VAT if they meet the requirements set out in Title 2 of the German VAT Act (VAT).</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">Special F Ä are responsible for entrepreneurs based abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, the FA ChemnitzS ü d is responsible for entrepreneurs based in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of April 30, 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; as of March 1, 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.</seg>
<seg id="168">According to the findings of the BRH, these F Ä with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called pseudo-self-employed persons residing in the new Central or Eastern European Member States of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These (fictitious) self-employed persons do not meet the requirements for recognition as entrepreneurs set out in section 2 of the UStG, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working hours and the type of work they do.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information about the company and the business activity carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a binding form for all FE in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is handled either in special organisational units within the F Ä or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="174">With the help of this form, a risk assessment for the individual tax payer is carried out before the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the tax payer, the last digit is always a check digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID no.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="179">The VAT ID number is automatically assigned by the CLO if the tax authorities declare intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-declarations or in their annual VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT number consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he stops doing business), but only after all tax transactions have been processed (assessment of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer does business.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a rule, the validity of the VAT number depends on the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In these cases, the F Ä must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number, so that the validity of the VAT number can be terminated at this time.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the Value Added Tax Act (VAT Act 19 (1)), domestic tax authorities do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year plus the VAT incurred on it has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. Will probably not exceed the amount of €50,000 in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge other entrepreneurs VAT, nor to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they do not have to pay VAT, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small entrepreneur can declare the non-application of UStG 19 (1).</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration is binding for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">He can then invoice the VAT and deduct the input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-resident tax authorities can appoint a fiscal representative (22a VAT).</seg>
<seg id="191">The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free transactions and do not deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices must indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation in the two states is different.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first prerequisite for registration (among others) is exceeding the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the tax resident receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both the NK and BRH noted that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions, can lead to considerable misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration enables an accurate assessment of VAT for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules should be standardised for the whole EC.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.</seg>
<seg id="208">This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.</seg>
<seg id="209">This number is valid for life for natural persons resident in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the responsible FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a tax liability and the allocation of the VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International passenger transport by bus and coach</seg>
<seg id="214">The legal regulations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">Since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduct input tax in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 235 / 2004.</seg>
<seg id="216">The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport is carried out by persons who are registered as tax beneficiaries in other Member States or by foreigners who are tax beneficiaries in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return journey is considered a separate transport process.</seg>
<seg id="218">If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as VAT exempt in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has not been exempted from VAT due to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b).</seg>
<seg id="220">For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or until the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States.</seg>
<seg id="221">The legal regulations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Act 3b (1) of the VAT Act, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.</seg>
<seg id="223">Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and international passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the domestic part of the transport service is tax-exempt in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxpayer transports important persons through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany is considered taxable.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.</seg>
<seg id="228">This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus and coach mentioned in the registration of the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="229">The entrepreneur must state his tax-exempt transport services in a German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-S ü d.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport service is provided for a domestically based entrepreneur, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT to the FA himself.</seg>
<seg id="232">In its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident tax payer. This process is referred to as "shifting tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax resident and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the correctness of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each test, the mobile control groups submit an inspection protocol to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident tax payer can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the FA has doubts about the correctness of a VAT return, it can order an audit to be carried out in the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may request mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">The BRH does not consider these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to be too costly in relation to the low revenue from VAT on taxable passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the audit of the books of a non-resident tax auditor causes disproportionately high costs for the tax auditor himself and for the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter must check the foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.</seg>
<seg id="243">Accordingly, a higher time expenditure is to be expected for such an examination than for a resident tax payer, although the examination is limited to the passenger transport taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxpayer must comply with all existing tax regulations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="246">This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation is different in the two states.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT according to the transport route on German territory.</seg>
<seg id="251">If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="252">This registers the tax payer, who must declare the tax payer's share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three out of four Czech tax authorities registered with the FA Chemnitz-S ü d have passenger transport as a business purpose.</seg>
<seg id="255">The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="256">The Member States - which collect VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of the VAT assessment, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state where the transport begins or where the service provider is located.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">Unless the law stipulates otherwise, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period, even if no tax liability has arisen.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax liability arises at the end of the deadline for submitting the VAT return. The VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004. The due date of the tax is determined according to customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If there is an above-average deductible input tax claim as a result, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of this input tax deduction, without the need for an application.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax official initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="266">According to Act No. 235 / 2004 73 (11), the right to deduct input tax can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax arose.</seg>
<seg id="267">After this period, the deduction of input tax can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">An amendment to Act No. 235 / 2004, which came into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct input tax could have been asserted for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">A tax payer must file a supplementary VAT return if: A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections that do not change the last known tax liability, but only change previous information, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and tax liability in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">A tax beneficiary can file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The tax beneficiary must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the relevant facts were established.</seg>
<seg id="273">The VAT return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or via data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="274">Delivery via the Internet can be made with or without a certified electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on a data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="276">The form for the VAT return contains separate lines indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="277">The value of services purchased must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the atis system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of goods delivered to persons registered as tax exempt in other EC Member States is compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="280">The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered as tax exempt there is compared with the information in the summary reports of tax exempt persons from other EC Member States with the help of MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="281">Within the framework of the ATIS system, the credibility of VAT returns is checked by the FA.</seg>
<seg id="282">This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior review.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility check includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">In accordance with the provisions of section 37 (1) of Law No. 337 / 1992, the FA can repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="286">During its examination, the NK K found that the F Ä rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the relevant tax beneficiary if the VAT return was not filed.</seg>
<seg id="287">Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT declarations and the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are obliged to file VAT pre-declarations must still file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="291">The tax beneficiaries are generally obliged to submit a VAT pre-registration by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is incurred (conclusion 18 (2) VAT).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability in the previous year was more than €6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to file monthly VAT pre-registrations no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.</seg>
<seg id="293">The tax beneficiary can also opt for the submission of monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (beneficiary 18 (2a) VAT).</seg>
<seg id="294">If the annual value added tax has not amounted to more than €512, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT returns must be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="295">A resulting VAT liability is payable 10 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="296">A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no (statutory) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.</seg>
<seg id="299">In principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (surrender or payment) deadlines (except 18 (6) VAT).</seg>
<seg id="301">The extension must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment must be made.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period of December.</seg>
<seg id="304">If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no "supplementary" VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the VAT return to be submitted to the tax office by 31 May of the following year, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the tax payer are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">The tax authorities must submit the VAT pre-declarations electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The F Ä can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual VAT return can be submitted on paper or via the Internet with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If the submission is made without certification, the tax payer must also submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">If no prior VAT declarations or declarations are submitted, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the revenue generated by the tax package 6.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of late submission, a late surcharge can be imposed on the taxpayer (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).</seg>
<seg id="315">In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the F Ä often do not charge this late surcharge.</seg>
<seg id="316">In cases where the F Ä levied the late payment surcharges, the amount was fixed inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, especially when filing the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-community deliveries or purchases.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions must be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="321">The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data of electronically submitted tax returns is immediately available to the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="323">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="324">After all data is electronically recorded, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.</seg>
<seg id="325">The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically created test notes (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, tax authorities must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the turnover of the tax payer, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">Depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, the tax authorities in Germany have to submit their advance declarations no later than 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or month.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annual VAT return must be submitted no later than May 31 of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="332">There are some advantages and disadvantages of not filing an annual VAT return:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax auditor can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registration by submitting a single VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">If the tax authorities correct their information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;</seg>
<seg id="335">The L ä nder do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax authorities until the annual VAT returns have usually been processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This levy does not enable the German tax administration to check compliance with the sales ceiling for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the competent FA can compare the annual VAT return with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company in question.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax authorities are required to submit the VAT declaration electronically.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the electronic filing of tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary messages</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">In accordance with the provisions of Article 102 of Law No. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State must submit summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").</seg>
<seg id="345">The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the VAT number 7, the individual tax code under which they are registered in the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="346">Information on services is not provided in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="347">The tax authorities with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must submit the ZM to the locally responsible FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.</seg>
<seg id="348">Incorrect data must be corrected in a corrective ZM within 15 days of the discovery of the error.</seg>
<seg id="349">Incorrect data in the ZM are always replaced by data from the correction ZM.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similar to the tax returns, the tax authorities can also file the ZM electronically.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a tax officer does not surrender a ZM or a corrective ZM, even though he is obliged to do so under Act No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer must ask him to surrender the relevant ZM and point out the consequences of the non-surrender. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the tax officer is entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Act No. 337 / 1992.</seg>
<seg id="352">During its examination, the NK K found that the F Ä mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, when submitting the ZM, the tax authorities are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the omitted submission of a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">In accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004 102 (5), the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or corrective ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In case of disagreement</seg>
<seg id="356">8 of the information in the ZM with which The tax authorities correct incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a corrective ZM either on their own initiative or upon request.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax official must correct the data on the delivery of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">The tax authority does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,</seg>
<seg id="359">The tax official has proven the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or correction ZM.</seg>
<seg id="360">Corrections entered by the tax official, without a corrective ZM being submitted by the tax authority, do not replace the corrective ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are current, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from the CM will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT may transmit and receive this data.</seg>
<seg id="363">This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT at the Ministry of Finance). The CLO automatically receives the message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect VAT ID numbers specified in the transmitted ZM lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the incorrect VAT number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the incorrect VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="366">The list contains a "message about doubts regarding VAT ID number".</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxpayer must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return designated for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech tax authorities stated in their VAT return and the values specified by the supplier from the other Member State in their ZM for the delivery of goods will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="370">The clerks there must investigate the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="371">Three different situations can occur:</seg>
<seg id="372">A) The value stated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax officer checks the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="374">B) The difference is zero.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax authority meanwhile submits a supplementary VAT return on its own initiative).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="377">C) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, which the Czech tax authorities have indicated in their VAT returns, is higher than the value of their goods deliveries reported by suppliers in other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here again, it is at the discretion of the tax official to verify the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="379">After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the tax officer enters the results of his review in ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">These results are forwarded to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of transactions submitted by the CLO for review is shown in Figure 1 for the individual quarters of 2005 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="382">Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO to the FEA for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is partly due to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC member states.</seg>
<seg id="384">Discrepancies between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic buyer.</seg>
<seg id="385">There may also be an error on the part of the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries are indicated differently in the CM in the different EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the audited F Ä can be seen in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must surrender ZM on a quarterly basis, in which intra-Community deliveries are listed according to purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="389">The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="390">If a permanent extension is granted for the submission of the VAT pre-registration, this also applies to the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="391">The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="393">The competent FA can allow exceptions for individual tax obligations in order to avoid unfair hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">If the taxpayer determines that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a corrective ZM within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">If the ZM is not surrendered, the CLO initiates enforcement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="396">This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty will be set and - fixing the penalty.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German tax code allows the setting of a penalty payment of up to 25,000 €(i.e. 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of 125, 250 and 500 €in three stages.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the tax inspector acts improperly if he deliberately or recklessly does not deliver a ZM correctly, completely or in time or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.</seg>
<seg id="399">This violation can be punished with a fine of up to €5,000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-community deliveries cannot be entered into MIAS by the F Ä, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="401">The ZM data is only stored at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="402">The data from the summary reports are only available to the F Ä after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing ZM are regulated in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in MIAS).</seg>
<seg id="405">In the case of incorrect VAT number in the ZM of German tax authorities, the German CLO receives a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO is unable to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then his job to request the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="409">In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT number at the request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, remembering, threatening and fixing up to three consecutive fines takes too much time if a tax package is involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">The cases, which were finally reported to the responsible FE, were usually completed within one to two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The relevant FA refused to grant tax exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.</seg>
<seg id="413">If the tax payer submitted the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the F Ä nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="415">Therefore, the tax authorities often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information provided in the VAT advance declarations or the VAT return on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This comparison can only be carried out by the F Ä. This usually happens during the preparation of a special VAT audit.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data received from other Member States is processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT ID numbers are detected and reported to the affected Member States.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data will be used to control employment taxation in the F Ä.</seg>
<seg id="420">As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications are drawn up and sent to the responsible FEAs.</seg>
<seg id="422">This happens continuously, whereas the acquisition data of all VAT beneficiaries is later compiled and forwarded to the F Ä.</seg>
<seg id="423">The risk management system (RMS) for the investment procedure then compares this data with those for intra-community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">The system fully verifies (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, tax authorities who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must hand over a ZM to the locally responsible FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="427">The F Ä process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the tax authorities in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the same tax authorities in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the reconciliation will be taken into account in the tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to pay quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.</seg>
<seg id="431">Since 1 January 2007, the tax authorities have had to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="432">The data from the ZM are only available to the F Ä after their processing at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the tax authorities in the ZM only indicate the deliveries of goods.</seg>
<seg id="434">The provision of services is not stated in the ZM. Unlike the Czech F Ä, the German F Ä cannot correct erroneous information in individual lines of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="435">Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the tax authorities informed the FA of the correct VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries, which German tax authorities make in their VAT declarations, with the information of the corresponding ZM.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of the prior notification and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Based on these findings, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="439">The data transmitted by other Member States on the delivery of goods to Czech tax authorities will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchases of goods indicated by Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The Czech CLO makes the adjustment for each calendar quarter separately.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the F Ä for examination.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general control will only be carried out for taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax assets only if the RMS has drawn up an audit report or the tax authority has already been selected for an audit.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the F Ä from clarifying the reasons for differences.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">To combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information that may well be half a year old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the taxpayers had to surrender their monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly levy would only insignificantly increase the bureaucratic burden, since most tax authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or advance declarations and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or advance declarations.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be linked to the submission of VAT returns or advance declarations.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, a failure to pay monthly ZM would cause more periodic discrepancies between data on intra-Community deliveries and data on intra-Community purchases and increase data flows between CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="454">The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In order for the commitment to the monthly submission of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly submission at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O _ MCTL reports, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarters.</seg>
<seg id="461">This data can be found in the tables below.</seg>
<seg id="462">They have significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for the differences may be a different basis for calculating the number of O _ MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO relates the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO relates its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL notification was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information at level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">International exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions as well as on the tax checks they have carried out.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter referred to as Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: Exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information (RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their responses to a received RFI through the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which ensures the translation of the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and forwarding it to the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the responses to requests sent. It arranges for their translation into Czech and their distribution to the relevant FÄ for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the NK.</seg>
<seg id="474">Of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%), this processing period was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NK K ä mpfer had examined it. More detailed information on the deadlines within which Germany's requests were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this period and in 19 cases no reply had been received from Germany at the time of the examination by the NK (in the remaining one case it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information based on the declared information).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Figure 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of intra-Community sales indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information usually had values of more than €60,000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax officials in other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">Information is exchanged electronically between the individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of predetermined information to other Member States at regular, predetermined intervals without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="485">Structured automatic exchange means the systematic transfer of pre-defined information to another Member State without its prior request, once the information in question is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information about deliveries of new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="487">The tax officer obtains this information from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004 as well as from the copy of the issued invoice.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing this form, the tax officer enters the required data into the relevant document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, this data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Czech Republic also provides other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and on potential missing traders.</seg>
<seg id="490">This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local FA.</seg>
<seg id="493">The F Ä send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The F Ä are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is monolingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure the acquisition tax in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community delivery from Germany to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding sales below the minimum amount limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To answer the request for information, the CLO directs it to the competent FA and refers to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the F Ä to respond to the unresolved requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The F Ä receive the required information by letter from the tax authorities or by conducting an external audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: The special VAT audit, which covers all tax-related transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.</seg>
<seg id="504">With this short and rigorous form of examination, an announcement to the tax authorities is not necessary and it has proven itself in the investigation of an individual turnover.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the automatic exchange of information, Germany transmits the following information to the other Member State: - via VAT ID number allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - about the refund of VAT to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC Member States with the following information as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:</seg>
<seg id="507">A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT number, b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States, which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the purchases reported by a tax payer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of items that have been subject to taxation in Germany by the tax payer, e. potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as potential tax payers who have misused or misused a tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the locally responsible F Ä, who send the relevant SCAC forms to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, the NK ü st ä tzen found that the Czech financial administration handled 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were only handled by the German financial administration in 40.6% of cases within this period.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO draws the attention of the F Ä to the three-month deadline, it does not monitor compliance.</seg>
<seg id="514">Due to the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of time-limited requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="515">That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has now changed.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">Value-added tax risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The department for methodology and economic management of VAT and its department for risk management deals with identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.</seg>
<seg id="523">At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates risky goods, prepares conceptual risk management in the area of VAT and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and implementation of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.</seg>

<seg id="528">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="529">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="530">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="531">Among other things, the tax audit and tax investigation methodology department conducts risk analyses within the framework of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be audited, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and collects information from the financial administration and other sources in this context, and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Tax investigation offices exist at the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax authorities and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax authorities (e.g. in the Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of misconduct in chain fraud cases and the information of local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected subjects.</seg>
<seg id="534">These have a regional competence and carry out tax audits outside the local area of responsibility of the F Ä.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.</seg>
<seg id="536">These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on tax investigators with certain activities, multinational companies and tax investigators with particularly high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for reducing risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk-bearing nature of tax returns; - the task of "selecting the tax authorities to be audited", whereby the tax authorities to be audited are selected on the basis of certain criteria; - the task of "MIAS", which gives tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The task "MIAS" allows inter alia the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID number of tax beneficiaries from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax beneficiary as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the relevant tax beneficiary from other Member States, - preparation of a list of tax beneficiaries who have not submitted a ZM, - formal control of the information provided by tax beneficiaries in the Czech Republic in their ZM before this information is transmitted to other Member States, - preparation of a list of tax beneficiaries whose VAT declarations do not correspond to the information in the other Member States on the value of the goods acquired in the ZM, the other Member States' tax declarations of which do not correspond to the information in the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their task to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from state authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, trade registers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information is provided in Section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to their federal structure, both the federal authorities (especially the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a uniform database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the CLO, the ST I 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - Coordination Office for Special VAT Examinations and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud cases in the OPUS database.</seg>
<seg id="545">In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters and also query them.</seg>
<seg id="546">Kuss coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experiences of the KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">Experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.</seg>
<seg id="549">The formal review of the composition of VAT number of other Member States, which appear more important in the ZM of German tax authorities, is carried out at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal review takes place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its benefits (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The validity of the VAT ID number mentioned in the ZM is checked using the O _ MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID numbers, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications for the detection of suspected missing traders. Certain characteristics are used as clues, which usually occur in carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="553">The F Ä of the federal states are instructed to process these notifications and in certain cases have to forward the result of their investigations to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="554">The BRH audit confirmed that all available features must be taken into account in order to be sufficiently likely to conclude a case of tax fraud (instead of focusing mainly on a company's turnover).</seg>
<seg id="555">Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different clues when preparing the communications.</seg>
<seg id="556">The risk management system should also take into account other indicators, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the industry or the company's shareholding.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-declarations and annual declarations.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the system creates a list of those tax beneficiaries who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT declaration or annual return.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions specified by the tax authorities in their annual VAT return are compared with the data in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as this would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="562">Supplier and acquirer assume different times for the execution of intra-Community sales;</seg>
<seg id="563">Different accounting and tax declaration of discounts and rebates.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owner / partner, number of employees and payment method of the tax payer).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules so that suspected tax fraudsters are identified.</seg>
<seg id="566">This system is used in the processing of the VAT advance declarations by the FEA.</seg>
<seg id="567">This gives the responsible FA the information of the RMS before the VAT is determined.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the departments.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The system compiles a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the audit of the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.</seg>
<seg id="574">In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called data-mining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax liability is involved in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">Based on this list, the F Ä select the relevant tax authorities for examination and report the test results to the relevant data center.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three systems for combating fraud appears to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will occur during actual use.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NK and BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Just like the different approaches in the three above-mentioned German states, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - has proved to be a European problem, not a national one.</seg>
<seg id="586">The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.</seg>
<seg id="587">A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="589">The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is located.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected results from the audit of individual sales Within the framework of the parallel audits, the NK Kl ä ger and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="593">Which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two courts jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, the implementation of which was in doubt, or which the tax authorities of both states declared differently in the tax returns or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, the NK examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, in 43 cases, the NK examined the values of intra-community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax authorities had indicated in their tax returns and ZM, based on notifications from the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the NK ä mpfer, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="598">The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax resident purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax resident.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech tax authorities declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech tax authorities sent a request for information to Germany to check the value of the goods delivered.</seg>
<seg id="603">In its response to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the relevant German tax authorities had delivered goods worth €27,381 to their Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="604">It also emerged from the answer that the VAT ID number of the German tax ID number was only valid from September 28, 2004. However, the German CLO had granted another application of the German tax ID number and brought the validity of the VAT ID number forward retroactively to May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German tax authorities corrected the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="607">In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NK K ö rfer found that the Czech tax authorities had submitted supplementary VAT returns in 2004 for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which they declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time requested the deduction of input tax from purchases from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the responsible clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was included in the declared purchases.</seg>
<seg id="609">In response to a request for information from the NK K ö rger, the BRH stated that the German supplier had been registered as a VAT resident in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, when registering, he did not apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number exclusively applicable to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a VAT ID number to a tax resident, the responsible clerk of the German tax administration did so retroactively as of May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO allocates a VAT ID number retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO caused the delay after the application of the tax authorities to issue a VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO issues the VAT ID number retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not need a valid VAT ID number for an intra-community delivery according to UStG 6.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, a German buyer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of his supplier to explain the intra-community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the VAT ID number retroactively in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.</seg>
<seg id="618">From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">In their reply, the German authorities stated that the German tax authorities had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons they did not receive a VAT number until 16 February 2005 in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="620">Through a request to the locally responsible Czech tax official, the NK learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech tax authorities had declared in their VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which they had provided to the German tax authorities before their VAT registration (i.e. before October 1, 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">The (Czech) tax office set a tax liability of CZK 1,880 for the third quarter of 2004 against the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="623">On the basis of the request of the NK K K ä mpfer, the BRH determined that the VAT ID number had not been assigned to the German tax authorities until he registered his company, founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this VAT return, the tax authorities indicated significant intra-community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth 160 €(approx. 5,000 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In its VAT return for September 2004 as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer stated that the value of goods delivered to a German tax payer amounted to CZK 114,615.</seg>
<seg id="627">When checking the registration of the German tax authorities in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods were delivered to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech tax payer filed a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">Through a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NK K ä mpfer determined that the Czech tax authorities subsequently filed an application for the resumption of the tax procedure in the matter of the supplementary VAT return. As proof, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German tax authorities had been registered since January 1, 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax inspector in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">From the German information it emerged that the German tax authorities had only been assigned a VAT ID number on November 11, 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to resume the tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place, because the German tax authorities had only received a VAT ID on 11 November 2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the VAT on it and also demanded the refund of input taxes in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of tax liability of the German tax authorities, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German tax attorney named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax attorney.</seg>
<seg id="637">This name change at the German tax office also confused the Czech tax official.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official checked the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax payer from a German tax payer worth €22,686.</seg>
<seg id="640">Through a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NK Kl ä uge determined that the Czech tax official had examined the Czech tax authority in the context of an external audit, whether the intra-community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax authority had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech tax authorities did not declare the intra-community acquisition in their VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT number in the invoice, but only his tax number intended for transactions within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">According to the MIAS data, the German tax authorities are only registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions from 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax authorities, so that he could initiate appropriate tax proceedings if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech FA regarded this transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set any VAT on the purchase of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH stated that under German law, a tax exempt person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only have the VAT number of the purchaser in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">In this case, according to German tax law, the turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community delivery that should be subject to acquisition taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this business transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount limit of €15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax authority acquired goods worth €12,561 from a German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">As part of the intergovernmental administrative assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the verification of this delivery of goods by means of an SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech tax authorities declared that they had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with them.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax administration rejected the request for the transmission of receipts - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was below €15,000 and no other justification had been given.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documents for a subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax assessment remained in place.</seg>
<seg id="656">On the basis of a request from the NK K K ä mpfer, the BRH determined that the German tax authorities acted as "fiscal representatives17" (22 (a) - (e) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German tax authorities declared these deliveries in their VAT return and in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to tax exemption was recognised.</seg>
<seg id="659">Based on the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">In section 4.6.1 it was shown that the responses of the German tax administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the responses of the Czech tax administration:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. During its audit, the NK K K ä mpfer found that on October 5, 2005, the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of goods delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax authorities had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax authorities only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 in their VAT return for the same period.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed as the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, a Czech tax official used an SCAC form to request verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The NK found that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.</seg>
<seg id="667">Through a request to the locally responsible tax officer, the NK k ä mpfer determined that the Czech tax authorities had not declared the delivery of new motor vehicles to these German tax authorities in the value of CZK 11,816,103 in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax inspector issued a corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="669">Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">According to the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany. It was determined that the purchase of all relevant motor vehicles had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold to other tax authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004 the Czech tax authorities acquired a car worth €48,500 from a German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="672">However, the Czech tax authorities did not declare any intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="673">By enquiry to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NK K K ä rke determined that the Czech tax authorities had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Czech tax authorities did not file any tax returns even at the request of the tax official. As a result, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero on 23 May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="675">On June 2, 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to check the aforementioned delivery from the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech tax authorities did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the answer to the request for information was not received until February 7, 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the NK investigation how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="678">The VAT registration of the Czech tax authorities was cancelled with effect from August 23, 2005 due to non-compliance with the VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial answer was sent, because at the time of the examination of the NK and BRH, the responsible FA had not yet completed the external examination:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax official used an SCAC form to request a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities for deliveries worth €16,335.</seg>
<seg id="683">On the basis of the request from the NK K K ä rzte, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA at the purchaser in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its VAT pre-registrations for August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, a Czech tax official used an SCAC form to request a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, showing signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax authorities had acquired several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">The NK stated that the locally responsible FA had carried out several external audits at the Czech tax office to check the deduction of above-average input taxes.</seg>
<seg id="688">However, an unjustified claim has not been established.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that the German tax authorities had declared in their VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114 for the relevant period, and that the examination of the German FA with the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-community purchases in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.</seg>
<seg id="691">The examined cases showed that periodic discrepancies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005 the Czech tax authorities acquired goods worth €35,716 from the German tax authorities, but the Czech tax authorities did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech tax official did not cooperate with the tax official and no business was carried out at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech tax official asked for verification as part of the international exchange of information, how the German tax official had communicated with the Czech.</seg>
<seg id="695">The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax authorities were unknown at the specified address and the goods were collected by an agreed forwarder.</seg>
<seg id="696">The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax authorities only delivered goods worth €21,659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech tax payer sent the German tax payer a false payment confirmation for the amount of €155,153 in favor of the German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After uncovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax authorities managed, with the support of their other Czech customers, to get the supplied material back, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.</seg>
<seg id="699">Through a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NK K ä st determined that the financial administration, on the basis of the information received, subsequently paid the Czech tax authorities, among other things, the turnover tax on goods deliveries from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.</seg>
<seg id="700">On the basis of a request from the NK K K ä mpfer, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods worth €7,916 to the Czech tax authorities after corrections.</seg>
<seg id="701">In accordance with German legislation, the German tax authorities declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="702">His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the verification of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 using a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to the request for information, the Czech tax authorities had supplied the German tax authorities with goods worth €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885 in the period in question.</seg>
<seg id="706">The NK stated that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit with the Czech tax authorities to investigate this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech tax authorities had supplied and installed a production plant for the German.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech tax authorities delivered the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German tax authorities did not accept the assembled production plant and claimed defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax authorities charged the German company the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German tax payer received the invoices, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">By enquiring with the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NK K ä mpfer determined that all invoices had been properly recorded in the books of the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="713">The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax authorities and related to invoices invoiced after May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH found that the locally competent FA came to the conclusion on the basis of the response of the Czech tax administration that these sales were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax liability to the German including the assembly performed.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German service recipient of the work delivery owes the VAT in accordance with the German VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">Since the VAT liability of the German tax payer remained unchanged, the German FA did not initiate a correction of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to MIAS data, in February 2005 the Czech tax authorities acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany to verify this information.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax authority C had delivered this machine to the Czech tax authority B in 2004, but that it had returned it to the German tax authority C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax authorities in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">The answer to the request for information also revealed that the German tax authorities had delivered the machine to the Czech tax authorities in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">He received the machine at the headquarters of the German tax office in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since this delivery (from C to A) only took place within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">By enquiring with the local tax officer responsible for the tax package B, the NK K ä st determined that according to the MIAS data, the German tax package C had delivered goods worth €88,027 to the Czech tax package (another machine) in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">The tax authorities declared that they had not received the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">The answer was that the machine had been delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">In the course of further investigations into the tax liability B, the tax officer found that the machine worth €88,027 had not been booked with the tax liability B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German tax liability C had delivered to the Czech tax liability A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The NK also found that the Czech tax official responsible for the tax credit A had carried out an audit at the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax official had the invoice of the German tax auditor C dated February 7, 2005, in which the tax auditor A is specified as the recipient of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax official noted that the tax inspector A had not recorded this invoice.</seg>
<seg id="733">The taxpayer A had concluded a lease agreement with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company rma delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also took care of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH found that the German tax payer C did not deliver the machine worth €88,027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-exempt delivery within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the claim of the German tax exempt C for VAT and corrected the information in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German tax authorities delivered the machine to the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="740">Under German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">The BRH also noted that the German tax authorities had indicated in their ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="743">The figure below represents the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">During the examination of requests for information received, the NK k ä mpfer noted that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany on October 4, 2005, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a deliberate intra-Community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The German tax authorities have not been active in business since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The NK stated that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="749">The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim by the German tax authorities against the German tax authorities, which the Czech tax authorities had asserted as a shareholder in the German company at the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided to the NK, the Czech tax official has so far no information that the German tax administration is handling the case with reference to the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="751">The information available shows that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to indicate the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see also Section 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax payer delivered goods worth a total of €33,205 to a Czech tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="754">However, the Czech tax authorities did not explain the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax authorities had sent a part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax authorities, and that the other goods had been collected personally.</seg>
<seg id="757">By enquiring with the locally competent Czech financial officer, the NK K K ä mpfer determined that the Czech tax authorities had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="758">Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit at the Czech tax office.</seg>
<seg id="759">This test has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a German tax authority delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.</seg>
<seg id="762">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="763">With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax authorities and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="764">By enquiring with the local Czech tax official, the NK K ö rfer determined that after receiving the answer from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax office and remained with her in such a way that she wanted to talk to the company owner about submitting a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004 after reviewing the invoices.</seg>
<seg id="765">So far, no supplementary VAT return has been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax official informed the NK that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT assessment for the relevant tax period would be met.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax authorities delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for verification as to whether the above-mentioned Czech tax authorities actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German tax authorities had established a number of bogus errors in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax authorities confirmed the purchase of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech tax authorities, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but resold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech tax authorities submitted receipts for the sale in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech tax beneficiary was not registered as a VAT beneficiary in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official submitted this information in his response to the request for information to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="775">By enquiring with the local Czech tax official, the NK K ö rfer found that the Czech tax authorities had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which they declared, among other things, the value of the goods they had acquired from a German tax payer and at the same time asserted the right to deduct input tax for purchases from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="777">On the basis of a supplementary VAT return submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">Under Czech law, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">Thus, the Czech tax official drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German tax liability and demanded the payment of VAT worth €1,600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question of whether the Czech tax authorities had acquired a car worth €47,400 from the German tax authorities in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">Attached to the request for information was a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="786">Another attachment was a photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="787">In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport was stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that she had no contacts with a German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, the print of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="789">With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.</seg>
<seg id="790">By enquiring with the local Czech tax official, the NK k ä mpfer determined that the Czech tax office is not located at the address specified in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is not available.</seg>
<seg id="791">Following a tax complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech tax payer at zero.</seg>
<seg id="792">In the course of a further investigation, the Czech tax official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="793">The BRH found that the locally responsible German tax official had rejected the claim of the German tax authorities to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="795">In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech tax payer should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German tax authorities did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech tax authorities filed a VAT return and a ZM, which was signed by an unauthorized person, namely this shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech tax office informed the tax official that the capital owner had paid the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash receipts were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">By enquiry to the locally competent Czech FA, the NK K ä mpfer stated that the tax official had recognised the Czech tax exemption for goods deliveries to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer, as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there is no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to MIAS data, a German tax payer purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after purchasing goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">The German tax authorities did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions either in their 2004 VAT return or in the 2005 VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, he did not explain any initial sales in terms of value.</seg>
<seg id="808">Because of these discrepancies, the German FA made a request for information regarding the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.</seg>
<seg id="810">On September 6, 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax authorities had actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).</seg>
<seg id="812">From the documents provided to the NK by the responsible tax official, it can be seen that on March 30, 2006, a protocol on the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005 was drawn up together with the managing director of the Czech tax office.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the tax inspector was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the commercial register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on May 16, 2005, without a new managing director being appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech tax authorities have not issued any VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="816">In the context of the parallel investigation, the NK Circuit, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany that were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two courts exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-S ü d) that it wanted to conduct tax transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Based on this information, the company was registered from June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) to manufacture wind turbines and deliver them to Austria on behalf, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to insufficient in-house production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German tax resident (UDE).</seg>
<seg id="822">The following illustration shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of the wind turbines:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="824">The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for assembly on its behalf, at its own risk and on its own account.</seg>
<seg id="825">Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of wind turbines is controllable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">Because the forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport began, i.e. in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as tax-exempt in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the Czech company's domicile 19.</seg>
<seg id="828">Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.</seg>
<seg id="830">However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">The remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, were delivered in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community deliveries from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM submitted to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The NK found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">Cooperation between at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required to ensure taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the NK ä rger and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences caused by the different legislation in 2004 between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audited cases also show that it takes some time for the tax authorities to settle and the F Ä to apply the new legal provisions:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech tax package of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 reported to a German tax package.</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech tax cardholder reported intra-Community deliveries to another German tax cardholder with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.</seg>
<seg id="842">From the information transmitted by the BRH to the NK, it emerged that in both cases electricity supplies were involved.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech tax authorities took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in accordance with the Czech Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">During a further examination of these business transactions, an audit group of the NK K ö rfer found that in 2004, different legal regulations on the supply and acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the deliveries of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 valid in 2004, according to the German legal provisions applicable in 2004 it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No. 635 / 2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the Federal Republic of Germany, it was further established that a Czech tax payer declared intra-Community deliveries to a German tax payer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax payer declared intra-Community deliveries to another German tax payer with a value of CZK 263,470,776 for the same period.</seg>
<seg id="848">Information transmitted by the BRH to the NK ä rke showed that in both cases it had been a matter of supplies of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">In accordance with the wording of Act No. 235 / 2004 applicable from January 1, 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, his place of business or his place of business for which this delivery is made.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, the Czech tax authorities should not have stated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both tax authorities treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a difference of 503,881,939 CZK in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="852">Final remark</seg>
<seg id="853">Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NK ä rke were achieved.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the relevant legal provisions for VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions came to light.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them are worth further observation.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit results, both courts of auditors developed recommendations for the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the further observation.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two courts of auditors is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of VAT administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement of construction services and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NK K K ä r) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The awarding of services by contracting authorities is of great importance for both the state and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state has the task of using public funds as economically and economically as possible and ensuring fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), the awarding of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities have to comply with EU regulations when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, the EU member states must transpose and apply EU procurement law into national law.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate public procurement themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The awarding of benefits is also an area at risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="12">Due to the inherently high damage potential, contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favours when awarding their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits for both the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="14">The focus of the audits was on the application of EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as the prevention of corruption in the awarding of construction services in building construction and road construction and transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">The allocation below the EU thresholds was also taken into account with regard to corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit results of both courts are summarised in this joint report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="18">Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits, which it carried out in 2011 / 2012 at the construction administrations, which are responsible for the road and building construction of the federal government in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors used results from previous investigations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The audits included construction measures in road construction, rail infrastructure construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the public procurement of the federal government is mainly carried out by the construction administrations of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In building construction, the awarding of contracts is carried out decentrally by those agencies that use state budget funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, freelancers are also involved in some areas of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="26">When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="27">Development of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is stipulated in laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by budgetary law and the administrative regulations based on it.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, many supplementary individual regulations are stipulated by internal administrative provisions for both EU-wide and national procurement,</seg>
<seg id="31">Such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in compliance with procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other legal provisions, which apply both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new regulation increased transparency in the use of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited the possibilities for corruption in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Outlines of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure in particular apply to EU-wide contracts.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are subject to the national award types (public tender, limited tender, hands-free award), which largely correspond to the EU-wide award types mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public tender (for national contracts).</seg>
<seg id="39">With the open procedure and the public tender, any interested company can submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another key feature of German procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">Above all, the division of a total construction project into specialist and partial lots serves this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="42">The individual allocation of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both of the aforementioned features of German procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are over 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures also apply to construction projects below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">An exception is the simplified procedure, where a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Czech public procurement law contains provisions, in line with EU law, according to which contracts should be concluded if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of this, 45.5 billion euros were allocated to public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, also includes the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The federal government's construction volume in building construction and highway construction (excluding rail infrastructure construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="54">The volume of contracts for construction work in construction and highway construction by the federal government in 2011 was distributed as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders and 6.6% negotiated procedures and open contracts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide contracts.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, representing about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, representing 37% of the total construction volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the threshold 2.7% other procedures</seg>
<seg id="59">The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded by public procurement authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant part of public procurement, that the prevention of corruption is of great financial importance in all contracts and that the open procedure and the public tender are of outstanding importance in the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the results of the parallel tests</seg>
<seg id="62">In their countries, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NK K K ö rper) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits on the EU-wide awarding of construction services and on corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="63">In this context, the working groups of both audit institutions compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">In doing so, they essentially stated:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos. 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the EU requirements, the procurement regulations of both countries serve to prevent corruption, which differ in their priorities and details (No. 3.2).</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, an essential requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information required for an appropriate tender.</seg>
<seg id="68">The service descriptions must be neutral and must not have any restrictive requirements.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Germany, the procurement documents have largely met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to adequately determine the subject of the order.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, construction work must be divided into lots if possible in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">During its audits, the NK found, particularly in the field of road construction, that the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and carry the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">According to the provisions of both countries, under certain conditions, the contracting authorities can agree on additional or amended services with the companies already commissioned, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective guidelines for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary primacy of the open procedure for EU-wide contracts or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts, applies.</seg>
<seg id="79">This allows more companies to submit bids.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economic results.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct estimation of the prospective contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, cost databases are used for cost assessments of public buildings, especially in building construction,</seg>
<seg id="84">Based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">In the case of construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to prepare for the planned contracts at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="87">The audited building administrations generally adhered to this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (No. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, not discriminatory and must be announced in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries should change as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.</seg>
<seg id="93">In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed requirements in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited administrations ignored these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (point 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, it is important to ensure that companies interested in submitting bids receive the same information during the bidding phase in the interest of equal competition.</seg>
<seg id="97">As far as possible, contact between these companies and freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description must be prevented in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The relevant regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">The audited construction administrations in Germany did not comply with these requirements in some cases (No. 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency must be observed when opening up offers.</seg>
<seg id="101">The requirements for labelling, documentation, safekeeping and secrecy of the offers are intended to restrict scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tests in both countries revealed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">In both countries, testing and evaluation of the offers are determined by specifications for the structure and process organization.</seg>
<seg id="104">The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting authorities handed over offers to third parties for review without first reviewing the offers and sufficiently documenting abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="106">As a result, the offers were inadequately protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed about the intended contract before the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="109">The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to meet the specified deadlines or deviated from the bidders' offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited construction administrations in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">The EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.</seg>
<seg id="113">Some of the shortcomings also reduced the anti-corruption function of the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">The contracting authorities of both countries largely met their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Basics of EU procurement law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="116">EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the member states.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general award principles of the European Union are, in particular, the competition law, the equal treatment law and the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the transparency law.</seg>
<seg id="119">In order to achieve these goals, the Procurement Coordination Directive contains special regulations for construction work to be awarded throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="120">To this end, their estimated order amounts must reach or exceed the current amount of 5,000,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="121">The rules concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, compliance with deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of applicants and the Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of applicants and bidders.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, affected companies can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">The importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="127">Corruption is generally understood as the abuse of a position of trust for private benefit,</seg>
<seg id="128">Which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hamper competition and cause significant economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of global economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices can call into question trust in the integrity and functioning of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">They have to check the organisational structure and processes of their administrations for areas particularly at risk of corruption in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.</seg>
<seg id="135">Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="139">In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a guideline and recommendations on corruption prevention in the Federal Administration. In addition to the risk analysis, the following principles must be observed for the awarding area: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and billing, accurate and complete documentation of the awarding procedures.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the responsible Federal Ministry for Procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,</seg>
<seg id="142">With the awarding data such as the estimated costs and the order amounts as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected nationwide and evaluated for abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders as well as the prohibition of all discrimination form the most important basis for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of the measures recommended in it have already been incorporated into national procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions UM14.</seg>
<seg id="147">The main provisions of the new legislation are as follows: Lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, the obligation for the awarding authority to announce contracts in advance, including the reasons for tendering, the prohibition of limiting the number of bidders in closed procedures and thus the abolition of the possibility of bidding by lottery, the introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, the introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Examination results on the individual phases of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Award documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Award documents The award documents must contain all the information that the bidders need for an appropriate tender.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the award documents must enable an accurate calculation.</seg>
<seg id="152">No risks may be transferred to the bidders that cannot be calculated for them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The award documents consist in particular of the service description and the contract terms.</seg>
<seg id="154">They also contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.</seg>
<seg id="155">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="156">The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are aimed in particular at the technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="157">These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="158">The service description must always be product neutral.</seg>
<seg id="159">Therefore, information about products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.</seg>
<seg id="160">Avoiding restrictive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of bids and for manipulation in their evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="162">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="163">Same or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications are implemented in national law.</seg>
<seg id="164">The services are basically product-neutral without factory specifications.</seg>
<seg id="165">As a rule, the individual services must be subdivided into performance units with the respective quantities in detail in the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="166">The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. euros per meter or per piece).</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases may services be defined by functional targets.</seg>
<seg id="168">In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and clear.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are required.</seg>
<seg id="170">Remuneration according to flat rates or time expenditure should be avoided as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite specifications in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their bids safely and without extensive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The call for tenders will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="175">There is no obligation to tender for construction work in lots in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="176">If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public procurement authorities can divide construction services into several lots.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, construction services are generally to be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and / or by type or subject area (specialist lots).</seg>
<seg id="178">The aim is to enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price agreements more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is generally considered the most economical.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be stated in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should allow applicants to fully and conclusively identify the criteria according to which their offers should be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required for EU-wide award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="183">In the case of national award procedures, the evaluation criteria are only to be recorded in an internal administrative award note.</seg>
<seg id="184">In Germany, award documents drawn up by commissioned freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or surveyors in the building construction and some road construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client through contact with these freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send procurement documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contact person of the companies is solely the client.</seg>
<seg id="188">There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always incurred for large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="190">In both countries, the legal provisions allow the awarding of supplements to the already commissioned company to a certain extent, without the need for a public procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">According to EU regulations and German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services must not exceed half of the main order.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% for awarding contracts without public notice.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.</seg>
<seg id="195">If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is not possible according to the regulations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="196">In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed must be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.</seg>

<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">Some performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications - such as for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product was considered.</seg>
<seg id="205">Performance lists broken down by partial performance</seg>
<seg id="206">In none of the examined procedures has the BRH found violations of the commandment to advertise services in principle in a list of services subdivided by partial services.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="208">In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="209">In some procedures, the award documents had to be corrected during the offer phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.</seg>
<seg id="210">In some cases, the performance lists contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.</seg>
<seg id="211">Almost half of a list of services for demolition work consisted of such demand items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Lots and scoring criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">Many awards lacked the prescribed justification as to why the services, which were predominantly advertised to the unskilled, were not further divided into partial lots.</seg>
<seg id="214">There were no objections when specifying the criteria to be used when evaluating the offers.</seg>
<seg id="215">References to freelancers</seg>
<seg id="216">A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.</seg>
<seg id="217">Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or reports.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender".</seg>
<seg id="219">In the building construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints shown mainly to the omissions of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="220">The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity to adequately control the performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="221">NK Catching up</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.</seg>
<seg id="223">The registry did not allow the use of comparable products without justification.</seg>
<seg id="224">During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="225">Performance descriptions with performance units</seg>
<seg id="226">In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="227">As performance units, it only specified the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="229">During the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were changed four times in the period August to September 2009 as part of a non-open procedure,</seg>
<seg id="230">Because the scope of services had increased significantly and the technical requirements had changed.</seg>
<seg id="231">Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary structural investigations and incomplete construction drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="232">During the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior contained no requirements for product quality.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result of these missing specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high quality equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lots and eligibility criteria</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the awarding of partial contracts is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="236">An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts had been allocated, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible at a total cost of 620.3 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="237">With six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved with a random award.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded in batches, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total award.</seg>
<seg id="239">When awarding road construction services, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.</seg>
<seg id="240">During the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required bidders in an open procedure to prove at least three road construction projects worth 28 million euros each from the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public procurement of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects, for which the contracting authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least 480 million euros over the last three years as a criterion for the companies' suitability.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were allocated to contracts from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.</seg>
<seg id="244">With 46 award procedures with a contract volume of 528 million euros, only two or even one bidder submitted an offer.</seg>
<seg id="245">The NK ä mpfer showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Additional services</seg>
<seg id="247">In two cases, when building a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not use any of the legally prescribed procedures for awarding additional services and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.</seg>
<seg id="248">Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, additions of up to 63.7 million euros (net) were made in the first case and up to 165.4 million euros (net) in the second case, increasing the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="249">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="250">In the case of several university buildings, some achievements were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="251">Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiated procedures with the contracted companies without notice.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction work in negotiated procedures without tendering.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction period, the contracting authority expanded the scope of the work by 2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="254">The standard prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">On the basis of a random examination of construction projects, the NK K ä mpfer found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="257">In Germany, on the other hand, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="260">The basic rules governing the procurement documents are largely identical in both countries and take EU requirements into account.</seg>
<seg id="261">They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">For example, the requirement for the sufficient certainty of the service descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and prepare their offers appropriately,</seg>
<seg id="263">Protect the client from additional services to be agreed retrospectively and also curb speculative scope.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and possibilities for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="265">There are no requirements to this extent in the Czech Republic, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="266">The requirements for the performance description have largely been met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The requirement to form lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.</seg>
<seg id="269">In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NK K ä mpfer, the awarding of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can result in restrictions of the provider field to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="270">The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">A limited number of competitors also often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">The regulatory approaches in both countries differ when awarding and remunerating additional or modified services.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to EU requirements and German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without award procedures with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiated procedure without notice.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="277">Because the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of award, the client determines the scope of the number of companies participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">It can leave the circle of potential applicants and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by specifying non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="283">Europe-wide procurement procedures are to be applied for construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">When selecting the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account in particular the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total contract value of the construction work of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction work must be awarded Europe-wide according to open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="288">For construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1,000,000 euros and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="289">A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or consciously estimated at too low cost values in order to withdraw it from the obligation to award construction services across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="290">As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of award method is of great importance in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="291">The detailed justification of the selected type of award as well as the examination of the obligation to apply EU procurement rules are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and thresholds into national law.</seg>
<seg id="295">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="297">There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. Other procedures, however, are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national contracts - the public tender takes precedence. This is stipulated by budget and procurement law as well as by the directives on corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of award - such as the non-open procedure or the limited tender procedure - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">The existence of an exceptional case must be clearly justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure as unlimited competition as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by specifying certain bidders and to make it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.</seg>
<seg id="302">The principle of public tendering is a key element in preventing corruption in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimation of the prospective contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.</seg>
<seg id="304">The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public building construction.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain cost parameters for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such cost parameters, the estimated order value of a planned advance or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few construction administrations in Germany have appropriate cost databases for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, a nationwide introduction is planned for all road construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price calculations of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated costs of construction work.</seg>
<seg id="310">In most cases, the cost estimates are based on estimates by the financing body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction site.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures to standardize cost determination procedures are still in their infancy.</seg>
<seg id="312">As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the responsible ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.</seg>
<seg id="313">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="314">In this database, information on the cost of materials and on construction and fit-out trades as well as other cost-relevant data will be recorded in order to enable cost determination and determination of unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control,</seg>
<seg id="316">Which will serve as a benchmark for pricing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="317">Key test results BRH</seg>
<seg id="318">Choice of award procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities tendered the construction work largely in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus followed the budgetary and procurement requirements.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the federal government's construction work in building construction was tendered publicly or in an open process.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">The choice of non-public procurement methods lacked detailed reasons why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.</seg>
<seg id="323">On the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, the BRH found in a cross-sectional investigation that the non-public types of procurement have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as for hands-free tenders.</seg>
<seg id="325">The investigation also showed that tender prices for limited tenders and open contracts were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel investigations by the Federal Building Ministry and a Land Audit Office confirmed the differences in profitability between public and non-public procurement types.</seg>
<seg id="327">As a result of its cost-effectiveness studies, the Federal Building Ministry even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Taking the EU threshold into account</seg>
<seg id="329">As a rule, the audited contracting authorities drew up procurement plans for the construction projects for which they had determined an estimated total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, in which they determined the construction works to be awarded according to EU and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the award plans, a share of more than 80% of the construction work was to be awarded throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to award contracts across the EU by underestimating costs.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, partly as a result of erroneous calculations, the minimum proportion of EU procurement procedures was actually undercut.</seg>
<seg id="333">During construction, some contracting authorities improperly changed the specifications of their procurement plans.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures was still observed.</seg>
<seg id="335">For most of the construction measures audited, the proportion of EU-wide contracts according to the settlement results was usually lower than envisaged under the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities violated the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more in EU-wide procedures,</seg>
<seg id="337">And chose national procedures instead.</seg>
<seg id="338">NK Catching up</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of award type</seg>
<seg id="340">In several major construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects as part of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction work into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.</seg>
<seg id="341">As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were then awarded in simplified procedures or even in violation of legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="342">Calculation methods for the estimated order value</seg>
<seg id="343">In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an inadequate instrument for determining the expected order values.</seg>
<seg id="344">The data were based on just completed construction projects, but there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contracted companies.</seg>
<seg id="345">For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% below the estimated order values determined using the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="347">In building construction, the projected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimates.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed contract value, but eight additions in the course of construction led to a cost increase of 2.1 million euros or 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.</seg>
<seg id="352">The estimated price for the construction of a large library was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. The costs for the construction of a judicial building rose disproportionately by 139%, as the usable space had only increased by 12%.</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have transposed the EU regulations for determining the type of award and for taking the EU threshold value into account into national law.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations applicable in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procedures or public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="357">Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of tenders and the most economic results.</seg>
<seg id="358">The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the field of applicants by manipulation-prone stipulations of the client and by making price agreements between the bidders more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="359">The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="360">Under Czech law, contracting authorities can award contracts in open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="361">According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in proceedings with previous competition.</seg>
<seg id="362">This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been distributed inadmissibly in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.</seg>
<seg id="364">When taking the EU threshold into account, errors had to be detected in Germany, which resulted in a fall below the minimum proportion of EU-wide tendered services.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the estimated costs of construction work and construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">If necessary, the construction administrations should ensure through further checks that the specifications for the choice of the type of contract and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions are created for appropriate cost assessments.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and announcement</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public contractor must inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">The preliminary information should contain the essential procurement information on the planned construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wants to shorten the tender periods for open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">In announcements, the client must provide more details about the planned Europe-wide construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="374">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other things, it has to make known the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.</seg>
<seg id="376">The common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardized throughout Europe, must be used to describe the subject of the order.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the purchaser's profile.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the announcement text has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or inaccurate information in the announcement may affect competition and may even support manipulation.</seg>

<seg id="382">Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for prior information and publication into national law.</seg>
<seg id="383">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published in the case of construction work not to be awarded across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="385">Procurement procedures may not start until one month after the preliminary information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or the national Official Journal (for all contracts).</seg>
<seg id="386">The publication of preliminary information can only be dispensed with in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, no preliminary information is required for non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="388">Announcements for public tenders and participation competitions prior to restricted tenders must be published on the federal internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of limited invitations to tender without competition, announcements of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are mandatory (ex ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.</seg>
<seg id="391">In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small size of the loose construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="392">In the Czech Republic, this regulation has only a small impact, as much less construction work is divided into lots.</seg>

<seg id="395">Preliminary information</seg>
<seg id="396">The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open procedures, however, they shortened the offer periods, even though the 52 days required between the submissions of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">Other shortened procedures were only advertised after the twelve-month period of validity of the preliminary information had expired and before it was extended.</seg>
<seg id="399">Many published preliminary information lacked references to the planned division of construction services into lots.</seg>
<seg id="400">Announcements</seg>
<seg id="401">The announcements of the audited bodies partly contained CPV codes that deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or did not accurately record the required services.</seg>

<seg id="404">The contracting authorities of an audited construction administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="405">It published the reports on its own paid award platform.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the reports to the free internet portal of the federal government as required.</seg>

<seg id="411">The awarding authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.</seg>
<seg id="412">The restriction of the number of bidders was permitted under the law in force at the time.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in detail in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it wanted to evaluate the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="414">The awarding authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="415">The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent, because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of the announcements</seg>
<seg id="417">During the renovation of the former military site, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.</seg>
<seg id="418">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage information system with advance information and notification is an important component for implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement area:</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of applicants for non-public award types</seg>
<seg id="422">Unlike public procurement procedures, non-public procurement procedures do not allow every company interested in the execution of the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="423">In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a selection in advance as to which companies should be invited to submit bids.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention The EU regulations allow a limitation of the number of applicants for EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="425">In the case of non-open procedures, however, at least five companies are to be invited to submit bids.</seg>
<seg id="426">At least three companies are to be invited to participate in negotiated procedures with tender notices.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be given unilateral preference.</seg>
<seg id="430">In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both cases, the award result can be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.</seg>
<seg id="432">The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="435">The rules for selecting applicants are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should change as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor should competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The awarding authorities must justify the selection of applicants and document the course of the selection process in their award notes.</seg>
<seg id="439">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three suitable applicants must be invited to submit bids for limited tenders and, in the case of open contracts, several suitable applicants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Under the new Czech rules, except for two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in non-open and negotiated procedures.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.</seg>
<seg id="443">For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction site or a contracting authority representative must usually amend this proposal, for example by removing a proposed company and / or adding a new company.</seg>
<seg id="444">The aim is to prevent a single person from conclusively determining the group of companies to be involved in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could enable far-reaching agreements between the parties.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of companies to be requested must be treated confidentially - also with regard to freelancers - and not made generally available.</seg>
<seg id="447">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is a loophole in Czech legislation.</seg>
<seg id="451">Essential test results</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of applicants</seg>
<seg id="454">With a few exceptions, the requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts was met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An evaluation by the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in building construction revealed that the contracting authorities called on an average of 6.6 companies to submit tenders for limited federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for open contracts.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of companies and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">Especially for trades with a few providers, the contracting authorities did not always change the circle of selected applicants.</seg>
<seg id="458">Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and proven from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="459">As a reason for this, they stated that in non-public proceedings they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete even before the invitation to submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="460">The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is on average much lower and therefore, for example, longer distances are more important than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Multi-eyes principle and suggestions Freelancer</seg>
<seg id="463">Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have an independent person amend the proposed list of companies to be requested.</seg>
<seg id="464">They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.</seg>
<seg id="465">It was often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to submit bids.</seg>
<seg id="466">Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the application lists and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="467">Thus, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves against possible manipulation to the extent required.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidential handling of bidding lists</seg>
<seg id="469">At a contracting authority, the lists of the companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.</seg>
<seg id="470">In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or approved companies could have been passed on unauthorized and, for example, could have allowed agreements between these companies.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases reasons for the selection of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="473">NK Catching up</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection of candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive any information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="476">In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="477">In one process, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="478">The award committee then conducted a lottery to select the companies.</seg>
<seg id="479">However, this approach, which was generally permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="481">Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements limit such abuse possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of the Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have not been adequately implemented and the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings identified.</seg>
<seg id="486">Offer phase</seg>
<seg id="487">The tender phase begins with the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, during which the companies can draw up bids on the basis of the award documents sent to them.</seg>
<seg id="488">Applicants can submit their bids until the end of the offer period set by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="490">There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authorities have to observe the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the manipulation possibilities that exist during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="492">These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.</seg>
<seg id="493">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="495">The award documents, on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their bids, are only to be sent by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Freelancers involved in the award process are not allowed to perform this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The awarding authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">In case of ambiguities in the award documents or other questions about the tender, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="499">Freelancers commissioned to prepare the award documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="501">Freelancers must not become a hub of the award procedure through which contacts can be made with anti-competitive consequences.</seg>
<seg id="502">Bids sent by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Electronically transmitted offers have a technical encryption.</seg>
<seg id="504">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, the bids received must be marked with an entry stamp and sent directly, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for custody.</seg>
<seg id="507">This employee may not be involved in the award.</seg>
<seg id="508">The received offers are to be kept under lock and key until the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, bids received are marked with a file number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt details in a protocol.</seg>
<seg id="511">The safekeeping of offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="512">Essential test results</seg>
<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">The tests for the tender phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="515">Dispatch of the award documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The contracting authorities of the audited building management sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service provider.</seg>
<seg id="517">Freelancers did not send any award documents.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to applicants</seg>
<seg id="519">The audited building administration did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding when appointing the contact persons for queries and information.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting authority in the service descriptions, but from the project managers as contact persons.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some award documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had created the performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="522">In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="523">Identification of offers</seg>
<seg id="524">All bids received by the audited building administration were stamped with an entrance stamp and entry note.</seg>
<seg id="525">In some freelance contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="526">Keeping the offers safe</seg>
<seg id="527">After labelling, not all bids were sent directly and immediately to the custodian, who enclosed the bids in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">In the meantime, the offers were stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which every employee had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another department had hung up a letterbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers made there even stayed overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">Since the slot in this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only employees, but also visitors to the department would have had the opportunity to take out offers received and, if necessary, manipulate them.</seg>
<seg id="531">NK Catching up</seg>
<seg id="532">On the Czech side, no defects were reported.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="534">During the bidding phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process will be prevented in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="535">By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.</seg>
<seg id="536">The regulations on receipt, custody and secrecy of the offers appear suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.</seg>
<seg id="543">From the opening date, the bidders are bound to their bids until the deadline set by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">There are no separate EU regulations for the opening of offers.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, the national regulations on corruption prevention contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>

<seg id="548">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the registry.</seg>
<seg id="551">The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from uncontrollably manipulating the offers when opening them.</seg>
<seg id="552">In most award procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="553">Only offers submitted to the negotiator at the opening of the first offer are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="554">Late bids may no longer be considered.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices must be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="556">The minutes must be read out and signed by the negotiators.</seg>
<seg id="557">It can also be signed by the bidders present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of bids.</seg>
<seg id="560">Freelancers can also participate.</seg>
<seg id="561">The committee can also be entrusted with further phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary open the offer.</seg>
<seg id="563">The negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.</seg>
<seg id="564">The negotiator and, in the case of contracts in building construction, the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the award documents or in the award and contract processing.</seg>
<seg id="565">In the minutes of the opening date, according to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information about discounts and discounts as well as special features such as damaged or delayed offers must be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's signature authority are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="567">The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way as to prevent subsequent changes and additions.</seg>
<seg id="568">The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are no corresponding Czech regulations.</seg>
<seg id="570">If only one tender is received in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.</seg>
<seg id="571">There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received, it must be opened and then evaluated.</seg>

<seg id="574">Multi-eye principle</seg>
<seg id="575">At the opening dates, the audited contracting authorities implemented the specifications for the MoreEye principle.</seg>
<seg id="576">They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries who were not charged with any other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in the case of freelance contracts with a smaller scope of services, there were isolated cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Protocol</seg>
<seg id="579">In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, for example, the late bids were not entered, in some cases even signatures were missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Identification of offers</seg>
<seg id="582">The contracting authorities examined as part of the cross-sectional review marked the offers according to the specifications with a perforation with the date of the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="583">Inadequate labelling had been found in recent audits of some beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practices after the complaint by the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="585">NK Catching up</seg>
<seg id="586">Offer period</seg>
<seg id="587">When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the offer period.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="589">The regulations of both countries for the opening of the offers agree in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency. This can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation when opening the offers.</seg>
<seg id="590">The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the labelling, safe storage and secrecy of the offers significantly limit manipulation possibilities such as subsequent changes to the offers.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, the persons responsible for opening the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The overall few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of offers</seg>
<seg id="595">Examination and evaluation of the offers The client must examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="596">It must determine the bid for the award of the contract that best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">The EU guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:</seg>
<seg id="599">First, the suitability of the bidders must be determined.</seg>
<seg id="600">Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="601">Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, are generally excluded from participation in the award process.</seg>
<seg id="602">The bids of the not excluded bidders must be checked mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.</seg>
<seg id="604">The review and evaluation of tenders is a particularly susceptible phase of the award process.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or bids that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">By favouring or disadvantaging bidders, the valuation result can be adversely affected and thus the determination of the economically most advantageous offer can be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the audit and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.</seg>
<seg id="608">It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.</seg>
<seg id="609">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="611">In accordance with EU requirements, offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements for the companies' proof of suitability to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are specified in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">After checking the suitability of bids, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="614">The evaluation must be limited to the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The submitted bids must first be formally checked immediately to see whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.</seg>
<seg id="616">If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the evaluation of the bids results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.</seg>
<seg id="618">The decisions made during the review and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="619">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for processing them.</seg>
<seg id="621">Only the contracting authority may carry out the review of the offers and the mathematical examination of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="622">It must only appoint staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.</seg>
<seg id="623">The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.</seg>
<seg id="624">If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make suggestions for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, award committees must be set up to examine and evaluate bids.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees prepare evaluation reports with award proposals.</seg>
<seg id="628">Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the contracts.</seg>
<seg id="629">If evidence or declarations required for the submission of bids are only incomplete in Germany, the contracting authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, in addition to the total price, the standard prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="634">If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of prices being set too low or too high for partial services, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id="635">If he does not succeed and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of prices, this offer must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant volume changes in partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases in the construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.</seg>
<seg id="638">A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">Bids with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more bids fall short of the correct price determination of the client or the bid totals of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their bids.</seg>
<seg id="641">If this is not possible, the contracting authority can exclude the relevant offers.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders can be cancelled after an economic assessment if only bids with unjustifiable low prices are available.</seg>
<seg id="643">In contrast to German procurement law, the knockdown cannot be refused for offers with prices significantly higher than the client's calculation for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its specialist supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">It has to decide which measures should be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supervising level must also agree, for example, for construction work over 50,000 euros, if the contract is to be awarded by hand, if a contract is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>

<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Suitability and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">The vast majority of the procurement procedures audited complied with the listed requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being available in full.</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, it was not clear whether the awarding authority had taken into account all the announced award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the criterion of "price".</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons to check the offers.</seg>
<seg id="657">Freelancers or employees involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, the freelancers commissioned to examine the offers also included employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="660">For the construction services, it was usually not comprehensible whether the offers from freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly responsible for processing.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and computational review of offers</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting authorities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and documented their results.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="664">In the audited documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were sometimes not or only insufficiently marked.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">In a sample in a building administration, the cheapest tenders deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs in three quarters of the examined procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="667">Every twentieth award procedure has been cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">Not all bid reviews and clarification discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there was a lack of further clarification, such as on the unit prices of the most important items.</seg>
<seg id="670">The deviations were often only justified on a flat-rate basis, for example by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction services explained that it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of a tender by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined estimated value of these services.</seg>
<seg id="673">Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="674">In a briefing, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the company commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="675">It remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or the offer price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the client rated the contracted company as a "cheap company" that could not meet quality or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another tender, a construction service awarded the contract for an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.</seg>
<seg id="678">She did not cancel the call for tenders and cited the inappropriate justification that this company could be concluded to have an adequate calculation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspicion of irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">There were two cases of irregularities in an audited construction administration, both of which were reported to the technical supervisory level.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the process.</seg>
<seg id="682">When applying the other regulations, the audits did not reveal any significant objections.</seg>
<seg id="683">NK Catching up</seg>
<seg id="684">Aptitude test</seg>
<seg id="685">For many of the construction projects examined, including university construction, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Scoring</seg>
<seg id="687">When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take the specified evaluation criteria into account when examining and evaluating the offers.</seg>
<seg id="688">In a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of road maintenance measures, the given criterion "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the offered reduction was not sufficiently taken into account by the second and third bidders.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the selection of offers</seg>
<seg id="692">In three tendering procedures in the context of housing development, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on which basis it had selected the successful bidder.</seg>
<seg id="693">When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros based on telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions alone.</seg>
<seg id="694">Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="696">The regulations for the examination and evaluation of offers in both countries comply with the requirements of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved differ from each other.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, the procedure is more tightly regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, especially for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, it had to be established in some of the audited procurement procedures that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the tenders were not or only insufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="701">However, without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers beforehand, thus protecting them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="703">If contracting authorities have tasks carried out by third parties in the examination and evaluation of the offers, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">When assessing the adequacy of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the prescribed instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, there were complaints mainly about the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Conclusion of the award process</seg>
<seg id="707">After examining and evaluating the bids, the award procedure is completed by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">The companies have the opportunity to check the intended award in the case of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or in the case of other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="711">A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.</seg>
<seg id="712">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="713">If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, a contract can only be concluded after the final decision in the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.</seg>
<seg id="715">The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the contracting authority to comply with public procurement law throughout the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="716">To do so, he must document the procedure sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="717">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it must not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a proper review and evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="722">The client shall place the order within the announced award period,</seg>
<seg id="723">Also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="724">In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="725">The losing bidders must be informed promptly about the award decision and the reasons for not taking their bids into account.</seg>
<seg id="726">Award procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, for example if the bid prices are excessive or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="727">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the 10-day and 15-day information and waiting period prior to the award of the contract also applies to non-Europe-wide construction services.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, these requirements only apply to EU-wide procurement.</seg>
<seg id="730">In the other procedures in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, an award procedure must be cancelled if only one offer has been received or only one offer could be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable bid, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economical.</seg>
<seg id="733">Essential test results</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">There were only a few complaints about the audited awards at the conclusion of the award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, EU-wide contracts were awarded to companies before the information deadlines expired, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In individual cases, order letters according to open procedures also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, the contracting authorities did not meet the award deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="739">In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second most advantageous offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="740">NK Catching up</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some contracts, for example for road maintenance construction measures, the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the statutory deadline.</seg>
<seg id="743">When awarding construction services for the refurbishment of former military sites, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after the statutory deadline.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the requirements of the EU at the end of the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of the defeated applicants or bidders increases the instruments of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="747">The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In future, the construction authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified in the conclusion of their procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the reasons for the individual decisions.</seg>
<seg id="753">In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.</seg>
<seg id="754">The order data is also recorded in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="756">A carefully and promptly prepared documentation enables the traceability of the award decisions.</seg>
<seg id="757">In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders in the event of contracts being awarded above the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential part of avoiding corruption, as the obligation to justify award decisions in detail significantly restricts scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent to the EU Publications Office within 48 days.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, also implementing the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the EU Commission compiles annual EU statistics, which enable it to gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.</seg>
<seg id="763">Regulations of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements into national law.</seg>

<seg id="767">Differing regulations</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the publication obligation for contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notice period is shortened to 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for limited tenders and hands-free awards from value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).</seg>
<seg id="771">Below these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information about the awarding of contracts.</seg>

<seg id="777">In a tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.</seg>
<seg id="778">In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="779">Announcements of orders</seg>
<seg id="780">In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publicise the awarding of contracts.</seg>

<seg id="793">Announcements of orders</seg>
<seg id="794">In the case of several road construction projects, announcements of awarded contracts were only published late or not at all.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="796">The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are largely identical in both countries and implement the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="797">The transparency of procurement procedures, including the awarding of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.</seg>
<seg id="798">The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic go a little further than the requirements in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="799">The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the announcements significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits conducted by the NK and the BRH focused on two main areas that are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the awarding of works by contracting authorities: The application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Anti-corruption measures are not only intended to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of trust in the integrity of the state.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of procurement law in both countries and the comparison of these regulations provide information on similarities and differences, which can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their procurement law and its application.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement rules</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed the EU requirements for awarding construction contracts into national law.</seg>
<seg id="809">This gives the Czech Republic and Germany an important common basis for awarding construction contracts and taking into account the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">The construction administrations of both countries have partially supported these bids very extensively with further administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">To a large extent, the Czech Republic has also transferred the requirements for construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, investigations by the courts of auditors have shown that the construction authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="813">The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the objections identified when implementing the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">Above all, the audits in the Czech Republic have identified risks that affect the profitability of the contracts.</seg>
<seg id="815">Incomplete service descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in violation of legal regulations. In addition, the cost assessments were usually inadequately prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, especially in transport construction.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">The investigations did not aim to uncover cases of corruption,</seg>
<seg id="818">This is also because the courts of auditors do not have the appropriate instruments.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the courts of auditors can check to what extent the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation when awarding construction contracts and how these requirements are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">The two countries have set different priorities for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="821">Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as key elements in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="826">In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very precisely how the bids for corruption prevention are to be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the opinion of the BRH, in particular the primacy of the principle of the open procedure or the public tender is a suitable instrument to significantly reduce the risk of corruption when awarding construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations when awarding construction services.</seg>
<seg id="830">The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some benchmarks.</seg>
<seg id="832">The construction authorities should further train their employees on the requirements for corruption prevention and make them even more aware of this problem.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the construction authorities had delegated to freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="834">Without controls and adequate safeguards, however, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.</seg>
<seg id="835">Tampering and corruption-prone tasks should therefore only be delegated to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against unauthorised interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">NK Catching up</seg>
<seg id="837">At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption, in which public procurement is the most important component.</seg>
<seg id="838">The Procurement Act and the associated implementing provisions have been substantially amended.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audits of the NK Kr ä ger took place during the implementation of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the profitability of the contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and all these aspects must be properly documented and published.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">In principle, the NK K ä mpfe and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU requirements positively.</seg>
<seg id="843">The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for awarding construction contracts within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous material and non-material damage potential caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both courts of auditors see the construction administrations in their countries as required to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and, if necessary, to improve them.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.</seg>
<seg id="847">The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="848">A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a positive impact on supply prices, provided that this leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by specialised construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, with the exception of transport construction projects, these tasks are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.</seg>
<seg id="851">Even after the completion of their joint project, the courts of auditors of both countries are keen to further develop the findings that are important to them and, if necessary, to bring them to the attention of their country's parliament and government.</seg>
<seg id="852">Both courts of auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings presented are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.</seg>

<seg id="13">Since VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the courts of auditors is required, which will allow a comprehensive assessment of whether the measures taken are suitable for effectively combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two courts decided to continue their cooperation and conducted a second parallel audit. VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Examination number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Administration of the VAT (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as NKK), audit</seg>
<seg id="18">Examination goal:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The VAT administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities for intergovernmental administrative assistance should be examined.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit was intended to evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, further examination fields linked to the VAT should be processed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The findings should be compared in order to determine whether the tax procedures can be optimised.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audit period was from 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the audit period until the completion of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination</seg>
<seg id="25">The courts of auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on an audit for the administration of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the previous parallel investigation, they had uncovered suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,</seg>
<seg id="27">Which made a re-examination seem appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="28">Based on the audit findings, the two courts of auditors made recommendations on the administration of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aim of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented and to investigate the suspected cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also dealt with other issues, including selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables and the VAT audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Court of Auditors found:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous review</seg>
<seg id="33">Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In the first audit, the courts of auditors compared the registration procedures for VAT in the two states and found differences that caused problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">The courts therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxpayers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This has also been taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="38">The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their eventual cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Courts of Auditors expected Member States to agree on appropriate rules, in line with their decision in principle, to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the latest version of the draft.</seg>
<seg id="41">The aforementioned common rules are no longer included, and the two courts of auditors regret that.</seg>
<seg id="42">They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary reports As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended to the Member States that the summary reports (CM) should be submitted monthly in future.</seg>
<seg id="44">The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed more promptly.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the deadline for submitting the ZM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the implementation did not come into force until July 1, 2010. It has thus not transposed the obligation to submit the ZM monthly into national law on time.</seg>
<seg id="48">Recommendation 3: Data comparison of VAT pre-registrations and ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of the procedures for VAT pre-registrations and ZM The German tax administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">Recommendation 4: Exchange on successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level During the first audit, the two courts agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria and elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Court found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The NKU audited the information exchange system within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Court of Auditors focused on Germany's participation in the "Platform for Risk Management".</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Audit of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the first audit, the courts of auditors jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been explained differently by the taxpayers of the two states in the VAT declarations (or VAT declarations) or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the audit.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits by the tax offices (F Ä) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit has shown that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed, and the respective tax administrations have taken appropriate measures to this end (including subsequent VAT fixing or the prevention of VAT refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between EU taxpayers covered by the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is used to identify taxpayers at risk.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the data exchange within the framework of EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with a German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.</seg>
<seg id="68">The NKU found both normal business transactions and those with suspicion of VAT fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.</seg>
<seg id="69">The F Ä were only able to check transactions with high risk to a limited extent. This was especially true for so-called "missing traders", whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports</seg>
<seg id="71">It is advisable for customs and tax authorities to work more closely together in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany and a number of other countries have refused to actively participate in EUROCANET, as they do not believe there is a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Federal Court of Auditors found that the German financial administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="74">However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation:</seg>
<seg id="76">Created by the Eurofisc.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">Intergovernmental mutual assistance in debt recovery is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, requests for intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are processed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Federal Court of Auditors and the NKU compared the statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">These statistics contained inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two courts of auditors consider a renewed discussion of the statistics at EU level to be useful in order to avoid future discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="84">If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the statistics should contain more information about VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">An analysis of detailed data can help the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">Both courts believe that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Commission should support the Member States in this if desired.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. VAT testing at large companies</seg>
<seg id="90">The courts of auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large companies in both states.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the tax authorities that they considered important in this context.</seg>
<seg id="92">It became clear that the situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="93">The CZ has a system for selecting risky cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss accounts).</seg>
<seg id="94">Overall, VAT control can be effectively controlled and analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="95">A special tax office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is no comparable system in Germany. This makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT control as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="97">The German tax administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="98">Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Examination procedures in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">Department II - State Budget Revenue as well as the regional departments IX Pilsen, X eskk ä ufte Budjovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava examined in the period from May 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 F Ä: Tax Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Br ü cken eclav, FA in Doma Lice, FA in Hodonic n, FA in Hradec Kr ü ckloe, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA in Pablonec nad Nisou, FA in Psek, FA in Prague, FA Pilsen, FA in Prague, FA 1, FA in Sokolok, FA in Prague, FA in Sokolok, FA in Molok and FA in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="103">The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Examination procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned P Ä B Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:</seg>
<seg id="107">Bavaria, Hamburg, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony. They also conducted interviews in the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files from the following departments were included in the audit: Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt M ü nchen, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg for large companies; Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, L ü denscheid; L ü denscheid Chemnitz S ü d.</seg>
<seg id="109">Discussions were also held with the F Ä M ü hlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-S ü d and the OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and M ü nster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two auditors</seg>
<seg id="112">Prior to the parallel audit, the representatives of both audit institutions met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">In December 2008, the presidents of both audit institutions signed the agreement on cooperation in parallel auditing.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams informed themselves about the first results obtained during exam preparation, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The audit teams exchanged the audit findings gained so far and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint audit report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two courts of auditors defined the following topics for their parallel audit: Evaluation of the recommendations given in the previous report; examination of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; examination of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany; examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables; VAT audits of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Audit of VAT administration in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint examination</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Harmonisation of requirements for registration of taxpayers within the EU Supported</seg>
<seg id="124">Based on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended to adapt the requirements for VAT registration and to introduce new rules for the cancellation of registration in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="125">These revised rules should more effectively reduce the risk of possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="126">In certain cases, it was found that the F Ä did not delete the VAT registration of taxpayers if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No. 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT Act").</seg>
<seg id="127">So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige the F Ä to delete if taxpayers repeatedly fail to submit VAT declarations.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the Czech VAT Act, the FA can delete the registration of a taxable person ex officio if a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for this; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; c) the taxable person no longer meets the requirements for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="129">The first examination had shown that due to the existing legal situation, the FA Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration of "foreign taxpayers" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was solved by amending the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">Accordingly, the FA is entitled to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if he has not provided taxable or tax-exempt goods or services with the right to deduct VAT in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly delivery of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="135">On the basis of the first audit, the courts of auditors had recommended the introduction of the monthly levy of ZM.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle for the surrender of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The ZM must now be submitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="138">In addition, a ZM must be provided if services, the place of performance of which is to be determined in accordance with Article 9 (1) of the VAT Act, are provided for a person registered in another Member State as subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="139">The prerequisite for this is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay VAT for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC with regard to the place of the service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation related to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">In its ATIS4 system, the Czech tax administration automatically compares the data on intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">The proper collection of VAT is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">That is why the fight against VAT fraud is of paramount interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.</seg>
<seg id="148">An external expert estimated the VAT loss for the 25 Member States in the period 2000 to 2006. After evaluating the available data, the tax loss for the mentioned period was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros, based on the assumption that the EU-25 lose an average of 12% of the turnover taxes due to them each year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first audit found that a Member State cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has audited the information exchange system within the EU (EUROCANET).</seg>
<seg id="153">Risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The Eurofisc network aims to optimise administrative assistance in tax matters and combat VAT fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities is to be improved in order to detect fraud as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later, Eurofisc could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The Ecofin Council6 already approved Eurofisc on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.</seg>
<seg id="157">Eurofisc is modelled on EUROCANET, which was developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7.</seg>
<seg id="158">The purpose of the system is to detect risky transactions and identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Harmonisation of the requirements for the registration of taxpayers within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system itself is constantly improving.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data provided in the questionnaire is now recorded electronically and will later be available for research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission had made a proposal8 to amend Regulation 1798 / 2003, which included common standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly delivery of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="172">On April 8, 2010, a law 9 was passed to transpose the EU directives into national law.</seg>
<seg id="173">It contains, among other things, provisions for the monthly levy of the ZM for intra-Community deliveries</seg>
<seg id="174">And comes into force on July 1, 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-applications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the VAT pre-applications and the ZM</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint federal-state working group has been set up,</seg>
<seg id="178">Which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="179">The concept is still being discussed with the countries.</seg>
<seg id="180">This working group also looked at an approach to optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level At EU level, relevant information is exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the initiative and initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan in the written procedure of 18 October 2006.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: Comprehensive risk management instruments, comprehensive influence on taxpayers' behaviour, comprehensive evaluation, comprehensive updating of the risk management guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports from the subgroups "Risk Management Instruments" and "Update of the Risk Management Guide" were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of the requirements for VAT registration and its deletion in various countries was dealt with at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amended Council Regulation 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218 / 92 provides for the expansion of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="192">The questions of registration and deletion are reserved for the national legislation of the EU member states until further notice.</seg>
<seg id="193">The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Member States reached political agreement on the latest version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="196">Common rules for the registration and deletion of taxpayers are no longer included.</seg>
<seg id="197">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="198">The two courts of auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly delivery of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="201">With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous audit, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow an earlier audit of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the cycle for the surrender of the relevant CM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not implement the obligation to pay the monthly ZM levy until July 1, 2010, and thus not on time, while the CZ complied with the EU's requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT pre-registrations or the ZM</seg>

<seg id="208">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and CZ use different approaches to identify high-risk entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">The Federal Audit Office focused on Germany's participation in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Audit of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">The first audit examined transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether discrepancies had been found in the declarations of taxpayers in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="214">For the audit, the two courts selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for which the tax audit by the F Ä of the Member State concerned had not been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration, as the German taxpayer did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for intra-German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="218">Through international administrative assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a VAT identification number in order to claim the tax exemption for intra-Community goods deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="219">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that - according to the audit by the competent Czech FA - the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration in which he declared the purchase of goods of the above-mentioned value and at the same time asserted his right to deduct VAT at the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">A Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased goods worth 12,561 euros from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">However, he stated that he did not purchase the goods and therefore did not declare them in his VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="223">Citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German financial administration refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of 15,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech FA could not obtain any documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax assessment remained in place.</seg>
<seg id="225">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxpayer had charged a Slovak addressee for the delivery of the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxpayer purchased the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the purchase in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased a car worth 48,500 euros from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, he did not declare any intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, he had not made a VAT declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at 0 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="231">Based on information transmitted from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the FA asked the taxpayer in March 2007 to file a subsequent tax return, which the taxpayer omitted.</seg>
<seg id="232">The audit established that the FA had carried out further audit actions in this tax case in 2007. It found that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the tax period December 2004, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="234">The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings against the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be irrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer is said to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) to Germany with a total value of 198 167 euros.</seg>
<seg id="238">In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, it was stated that criminal proceedings against the German taxpayer were pending in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">The audit of the Federal Court of Auditors revealed that after the conclusion of the proceedings, there was evidence of the German taxpayer's involvement in fraud.</seg>
<seg id="240">The intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to acquisition tax of 182 424 euros (for 2004) and 369 690 euros (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods of April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">Based on the audit findings and information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional VAT of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">Czech taxpayer A is said to have purchased a machine with a total value of 58,000 euros from a German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="246">In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer is said to have supplied Czech taxpayer B with a machine worth 88,027 euros. However, B denied the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with a branch in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech taxpayer A did not specify the purchase of the goods from the German taxpayer mentioned in his VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="249">The response of the German FA to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but a delivery within the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the audit, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after completion of an audit and the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">A German taxpayer is said to have delivered goods worth 11,600 euros to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which unlawfully reported purchases from another Member State, including the purchases in the amount mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="255">The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and set an additional VAT of 1,600 euros.</seg>
<seg id="256">Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an investigation is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="257">The ZM of the German taxpayer has not yet been corrected, as in Germany only the taxpayer who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the question of the purchase of a car worth EUR 47 400 by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After an audit for the tax period 2005, the Czech FA set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer had been cancelled because he had failed to meet his tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="262">The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax ruling.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer delivered goods to a Czech taxpayer with a total value of EUR 33,205, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="266">The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer repeatedly issued subsequent VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, the Czech FA was not able to clarify the difference in the amount of 134 273 CZK in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this on the grounds that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated and accepted the VAT declarations made.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA reviewed the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="273">With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of 31 998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="274">According to the results of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer submitted a subsequent VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period in January 2007 following repeated warnings from the FA.</seg>
<seg id="275">With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct input tax. Therefore, his tax liability for the relevant tax period remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures for the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the tax administrations in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including subsequent VAT fixing or prevention of VAT refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be an important source of information for identifying taxpayers at risk in the Member State of acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the competent FA with the purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on sales and taxable suppliers that are considered risky in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,</seg>
<seg id="283">Which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="284">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German tax administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit found both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">In the cases concerned, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003,</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">The F Ä did not establish any suspicion of risky sales when examining the early warning information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The taxpayers in question were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">The F Ä did not succeed in verifying risky transactions on the basis of the submitted accounting documents to prove violations of the rules for calculating the tax base and VAT, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with letterbox companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">The review of individual business transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the FEA and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The competent authorities reviewed most of the risky taxpayers and transactions mentioned in EUROCANET's early warning notifications.</seg>
<seg id="294">However, your options for checking risky transactions, especially so-called "missing traders", are limited.</seg>
<seg id="295">In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide proof of fraudulent action by the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="296">Stricter requirements for the registration of taxpayers for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would help to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="297">The taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for VAT purposes in order to simulate fictitious goods deliveries across the EU or to issue other taxpayers with formally correct tax documents, with which they then assert unjustified claims for input tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="298">If there are suspicions of carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="299">Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by establishing a EUROFISC network with compulsory participation.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Findings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="304">Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">The justification for this is that "from the point of view of the Federal Government</seg>
<seg id="307">No unequivocal legal basis [exists] that would allow the tax secrecy existing in Germany to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET. "12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German F Ä receive control notifications about the direct business relationships of the taxpayers registered with them with companies from other EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the relevant German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company established in another Member State, which is also in business relations with the German company from the control notification.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to actively participate.</seg>
<seg id="314">Accordingly, the audit had to be carried out differently in this area.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, there were no significant differences in the success of the detection of VAT fraud. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other tools at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13, which created Eurofisc, a network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be exchanged at European level and fed into this network.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for the exemption of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance in debt recovery</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on</seg>
<seg id="324">Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, levies and duties, VAT and certain excise duties, and</seg>
<seg id="326">Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed implementing provisions for certain articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain duties, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">The CZ implemented Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC through Law No. 252 / 2000 on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, this also had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, the aforementioned law had to be amended.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, the amendment to Law 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new relevant piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the respective original.</seg>
<seg id="332">Key principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. The principle of reciprocity applies;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. Administrative assistance shall only be provided on request and if all conditions are met;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. Administrative assistance does not extend to claims that are considered a criminal sanction in the requested state;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. The intergovernmental mutual assistance procedure for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. In the recovery process, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. Administrative assistance is provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. The principle of exhaustion applies: The requesting state must use all means to recover the claim to which it is entitled under national law.</seg>
<seg id="340">Law 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: Provision of information, notification of legal acts and actual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states</seg>
<seg id="342">The competent FA has to transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the recovery request together with the relevant documents electronically via the respective finance directorate to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the relevant language, scans it with all attachments and transmits it via the communication network or the common interface CCN / CSI to the competent financial authority of the state concerned.</seg>
<seg id="344">A request for recovery aid must meet the following condition: The claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">The CZ Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.</seg>
<seg id="348">If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="349">The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will check whether the request meets all legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the recovery request is granted, the FA has to determine the financial circumstances of the debtor, e.g. by extracts from the land register, enquiries about existing bank accounts and registration of vehicles at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="352">After six months from the date of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the result of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="353">The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxpayers in question are not available and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="354">All sums successfully recovered must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech FA dealing with recovery may, with the consent of the requesting state, agree on the claim hours or instalments.</seg>
<seg id="356">The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of default in accordance with Law No. 337 / 1992 on the administration of taxes and fees</seg>
<seg id="357">Belong to the requesting state.</seg>
<seg id="358">In 2006 and 2007 in particular, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ sent the recovery requests received to the competent FA with a delay.</seg>
<seg id="359">The same applied to the forwarding of the recovery requests submitted by the Czech authorities to the competent authority in the requested state.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the law on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="361">The situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">In accordance with Act 191 / 2004 13 (4), the Ministry of Finance of the CZ compiles statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This includes the number of requests submitted in the previous year and the number of requests received for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims.</seg>
<seg id="364">Based on the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission prepares its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit showed that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the CZ stated the claims by 5 250 000 euros too low. The reason was the incorrect information on the amount of a VAT claim introduced in 2008 (caused by the shift of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was then reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual recovery assistance is presented in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal basis for intergovernmental mutual assistance in tax matters is the Community standards Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">Among other things, the collection of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and default surcharges, is regulated.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated by the Tax Code (AO).</seg>
<seg id="374">117 (2) AO stipulates that the tax authorities can provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal standards of the European Communities applicable in national law as well as by virtue of the EC Mutual Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of the AO contains the legislation for the enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative actions of the tax authorities are regulated in particular by the enforcement and enforcement order.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the supreme tax authorities of the L ä nder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own responsibility in this area to the Federal Central Tax Office18.</seg>
<seg id="378">General requirements for the admissibility of a recovery request are:</seg>
<seg id="379">The legal requirements must be met (exactly 251, 254 AO).</seg>
<seg id="380">All recovery funds available domestically have been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">The demands for the recovery of which administrative assistance is requested are indisputable.</seg>
<seg id="382">The period between the issuance of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became unappealable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.</seg>
<seg id="383">The claim must be at least 1,500 euros.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states The German requests for the recovery of outstanding taxes are forwarded by the enforcement bodies of the F Ä via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Tax Office to the relevant foreign authority, e.g. the Czech CLO.</seg>
<seg id="385">The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental administrative assistance for tax collection (recovery) of 19 January 200419.</seg>
<seg id="386">This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">In addition to attachments, the request is forwarded electronically by the FA to the central authority.</seg>
<seg id="388">The latter checks whether the content and form are correct.</seg>
<seg id="389">If not, the request will be returned to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="390">Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Tax Office will then take over the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedure for incoming requests from other EU member states</seg>
<seg id="393">Recovery requests from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a receipt within ten days.</seg>
<seg id="394">It also checks whether the formal requirements are met.</seg>
<seg id="395">In principle, the Federal Central Tax Office forwards these requests to the central authority, which forwards them to the relevant FA and monitors the execution.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim and final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it reminds the central authority of the obligation to submit an interim report in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="398">After examining the formal and substantive requirements for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement authorities announce relevant measures.</seg>
<seg id="399">All amounts collected must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.</seg>

<seg id="402">4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases</seg>
<seg id="403">A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between the CZ and Germany have been selected for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="404">The following was noted:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT debts of a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 totalling 3 883 euros (109 820 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="407">It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a mortgage.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since the encumbered property was not sufficient to pay the entire tax debt, an instalment payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was made with the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="410">On August 31, 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. Accordingly, the taxpayer had paid tax debts amounting to CZK 49 600 (as of August 25, 2009).</seg>
<seg id="411">The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly afterwards, on August 28, 2009, another 3,000 CZK were transferred.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery request for tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling 180 869 euros (= 4 434 915 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="414">It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="415">After checking bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA determined that the debtor did not have attachable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Local investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">The Czech Ministry of Finance received this notification on 6 April 2009 and forwarded it to the German tax authorities on 16 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On November 21, 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT in addition to interest and fees totaling 3 139 euros (= 84 846 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="421">Only on August 6, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA. On February 18, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had paid the debt in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="422">On December 9, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully paid his debt in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on October 27, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Because of the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was established that the amount recovered will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounts to 6,649 euros and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance there was only a recovery request for the company in question amounting to 3 139 euros. The recovery request amounting to 6 649 euros could not be found there.</seg>

<seg id="428">On September 15, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling 39 957 euros = 956 654 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="429">It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="430">On 1 June 2009, the recovery procedure was initiated and a decision was taken to seize the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros per month in the past, but the responsible German FA did not agree.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxpayer agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on another amount.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax in 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling 113 444 euros = 3 116 304 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="437">Only on November 14, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the FA Prague 1, which is authorized to process tax cases of taxpayers not resident in the CZ; based on the available address, a locally competent FA could not be determined.</seg>
<seg id="438">During its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008, according to which the debtor's income amounted to 4,704 euros. However, it was unable to issue an enforcement order because the recovery request had been received after this date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to seize the debtor's assets from credit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On October 3, 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of a VAT debt, together with legal costs totaling CZK 146 223 742.</seg>
<seg id="443">It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA transferred the amount of 17 700 euros = 439 226 CZK to the Czech authorities via the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="445">A conversion error was discovered during the review of the amounts recovered.</seg>
<seg id="446">The amount to be recovered of 146 223 742 CZK was converted at the exchange rate of 1 Euro = 25.065 CZK, but a comma error resulted in an amount of 583 378 euros.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct amount to be recovered was 5 833 782 euros.</seg>
<seg id="448">As a result, a recovery request of EUR 5 250 404 was made, which was too low.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On March 1, 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery due to a VAT debt together with interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.</seg>
<seg id="451">It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="452">On February 4, 2009, the German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's revenues in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability: On April 8, 2009 - EUR 4 600, on May 6, 2009 - EUR 3 000 and on June 16, 2009 - EUR 2 500.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were transferred to the account of the responsible FA in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, the debtor and the FA agreed on a further payment of 2,500 euros by 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling 398 653 euros = 9 832 779 CZK, which included property transfer tax.</seg>
<seg id="458">It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="459">The request was returned in a letter from the German tax administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 3 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration justified this on the grounds that the real estate transfer tax is not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), f), g) and h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">Article 2 (g) also concerns liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and assets not mentioned in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new recovery request to the German tax administration, which should no longer include the real estate transfer tax arrears in the amount of CZK 61 759, but the arrears in VAT, corporation tax and income tax.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer amounting to CZK 7 079 735.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On February 6, 2006, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3,445 782 = EUR 123 328.</seg>
<seg id="467">The VAT debt amounted to CZK 1 133 967.</seg>
<seg id="468">Only on April 18, 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration</seg>
<seg id="469">And it was only on 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech FA the reply of the German tax administration dated 9 July 2007,</seg>
<seg id="470">According to which the German FA issued an enforcement order on 11 June 2007 to seize the bank account. The bank announced that it was not in business relationship with the named taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="471">This meant that the request for the German financial administration was deemed to have been settled.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for VAT debts totalling CZK 1,296,845 = EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The relevant Finance Directorate sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German financial administration on 15 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before submitting the request, the Czech FA enforced the tax requirement by seizing the accounts at banks and salary pledging as well as by debiting a property.</seg>
<seg id="477">Prior to the recovery request, a request for information was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">According to the reply letter of September 16, 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities amounting to 8 437 euros. On April 20, 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the recovery request and did not forward this to the competent Czech FA until February 12, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="479">According to this, the tax liability in Germany is unrecoverable due to the debtor's insolvency.</seg>
<seg id="480">No assets had been established, the income from non-self-employed activities was already the subject of other enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German financial administration regarded the request as done.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">When it comes to recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU Member States for intergovernmental mutual assistance.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The Federal Court of Auditors and the NK K ä rzte compared the statistics that the two Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">There were discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States prepare their statistics more carefully.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a larger number of requests for assistance, discrepancies in the statistics have diminished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both courts of auditors believe that a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics makes sense, so that the remaining discrepancies can be avoided in future.</seg>
<seg id="490">If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of amounts recovered per Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by Member States, the Commission could help Member States assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">As the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors argues that Member States with a low recovery rate should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.</seg>
<seg id="495">The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the responsible F Ä with a delay, especially in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="496">The same applies to the recovery requests made by the Czech authorities.</seg>
<seg id="497">The audit showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance was in breach of Law 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance in that it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 VAT audit for large companies</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 VAT audit of large companies in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General information</seg>
<seg id="501">The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules as for other taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="502">The audit of large companies is regulated by the Czech Law No. 337 / 1992, the "Tax and Fee Administration Act".</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large companies as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been established to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the relevant tax period is at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.</seg>
<seg id="504">The taxpayer is classified as a large company based on the turnover according to income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A natural or legal person is no longer managed as a large company for the purposes of turnover taxation if, in three consecutive assessment periods, its net turnover in the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period for which the conditions were met for the first time according to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="506">A taxpayer can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been checked for a tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">Until the end of 2009, all large companies were audited at least every five years.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on the proper assessment and collection of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="509">The F Ä 's audits should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually include several tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="510">The taxable large enterprises were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the responsible F Ä set up at a total of 13 F Ä.</seg>
<seg id="511">A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the requirements of the head of the financial directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition, she also examined</seg>
<seg id="513">Taxpayers with unusual and special business activities and</seg>
<seg id="514">Those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.</seg>
<seg id="515">Taxpayers with complex location distribution and organisational structure are also audited,</seg>
<seg id="516">Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion</seg>
<seg id="517">As well as taxpayers belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified deduction.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information on the number of audits carried out by the special audit bodies of the F Ä and the additional tax results of these audits are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No. 531 / 1990 for the regional tax authorities. In particular, the establishment of a special tax office with national responsibility for selected taxpayers (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion) is proposed.</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 VAT audit of large companies in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General information</seg>
<seg id="522">The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. For tax audits, the general provisions of the Tax Ordinance (AO), the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and the Audit Regulations (BPO) apply.</seg>
<seg id="523">There are also work aids.</seg>
<seg id="524">Levy order</seg>
<seg id="525">The provisions of section 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 - External Audit" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its substantive scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the audit announcement, audit principles, cooperation obligations of the taxpayer and requirements for final discussions and for the transmission of the audit report.</seg>
<seg id="526">External audits are carried out by the responsible FE (accuracy 195 AO).</seg>
<seg id="527">Tax Administration Act According to paragraph 1 no. 1 in conjunction with section 19, it is incumbent on the Federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits of the F Ä.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and scope of this cooperation will be agreed between the authorities involved.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office may require that certain companies designated by it be audited at a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="530">In this case, it can establish rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="531">Tax Audit Regulations In accordance with Article 108 (7) GG, the Tax Audit Regulations (BPO 2000) were issued with the consent of the Federal Council.</seg>
<seg id="532">It applies to external audits by the state tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Companies are regularly classified into size classes in accordance with the 3 BPO.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large companies are to be subjected to a follow-up audit (Section 4.2 BPO).</seg>
<seg id="535">In accordance with section 33.1 BPO, each responsible tax authority must maintain a group directory within the meaning of the provision.</seg>
<seg id="536">Work aids for the administration</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the following work aids have been published for the administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">"Uniform Handbook for the VAT Special Examination";</seg>
<seg id="539">VAT countries online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with instructions on how to use the data contained in MIAS on intra-Community business relations;</seg>
<seg id="540">Work aids for difficult and special situations.</seg>
<seg id="541">Central database for storing and evaluating VAT fraud and developing risk profiles;</seg>
<seg id="542">Taxpayers are classified into size classes based on criteria such as turnover and profit, although the limits vary depending on the business sector.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies - not only large companies - can be determined regularly (last deadline: 1 January 2010).</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, large companies must be fully audited.</seg>
<seg id="547">The exams are announced and usually extend to VAT,</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income and corporate tax as well as trade and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT can be audited either by tax auditors or by special VAT auditors.</seg>
<seg id="550">The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">The BPO 2000 assumes three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes to which a company has been assessed are subject to the audit.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit for large companies</seg>
<seg id="555">According to the agreement, both courts of auditors did not audit individual cases. They investigated the question of how the financial administrations proceed in the VAT audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="556">With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the tax authorities that is essential for auditing large companies.</seg>
<seg id="557">Which statistical records and evaluations for the VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">Are there any statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between combating VAT fraud and general VAT auditing</seg>
<seg id="560">CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration makes no distinction between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.</seg>
<seg id="562">Are there any statistics or records about the timeliness of the tests</seg>
<seg id="563">CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected VAT payers is recorded in the ATIS system;</seg>
<seg id="564">The same applies to information about the beginning and end of the examination of the FA.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the statistics for auditors summarized at federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not provide an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT special auditors focus on the last VAT assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.</seg>
<seg id="568">The statistics for VAT special auditors at federal level do not contain any information on the size class of the audited company.</seg>
<seg id="569">Are there statistics or records about the type of multiple result; for example, divided by:</seg>
<seg id="570">I. real additional result (e.g. application of a reduced VAT rate instead of the general VAT rate)</seg>
<seg id="571">II. Untrue additional result (e.g. relocation / postponement of a matter not objectionable under VAT law to another tax period)</seg>
<seg id="572">III. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)</seg>
<seg id="573">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of additional tax income broken down by tax type, the number of audited taxpayers and the number of audited tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (on-site investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Regardless of this, the amount of additional payments and incoming payments are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by tax type. However, no distinction is made between tax liabilities arising from a tax return and those resulting from audit actions by the FA.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the statistics for tax auditors and VAT special auditors summarized at the federal level do not differ according to the above criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Most tax authorities, where local surveys were carried out, did not differentiate in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="580">Are promising test fields recorded</seg>
<seg id="581">CZ: Yes, the FA can select examination cases based on criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="583">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for tax auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a joint approach.</seg>
<seg id="585">According to this, tax auditors and tax investigators in the L ä nder must enter the additional tax result achieved by them in ZAUBER if a certain threshold is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. on the origin of the additional VAT result achieved.</seg>
<seg id="587">What are the most common findings</seg>
<seg id="588">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="589">Large taxable companies have unjustifiably claimed input tax deduction for purchased goods and services,</seg>
<seg id="590">Which have not been used for entrepreneurial activities in accordance with CZ 72 (1) UStG;</seg>
<seg id="591">Which were used for representation expenses in accordance with the 75 (3) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="592">Due to invoices that do not comply with the requirements of CZ 73 (1) VAT</seg>
<seg id="593">Taxable large companies have omitted the registration of VAT to be paid provided for in Article 21 (1) CZ UStG.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="595">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for tax auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="596">Findings on VAT from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, the Federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database, in which auditors and tax investigators of the L ä nder have to enter the additional tax result they achieve if a certain threshold is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="598">Does the financial administration analyze profitable audit areas and draw conclusions for strategic management</seg>
<seg id="599">CZ: Yes, for example, nationwide audits are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="601">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for tax auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide information on particularly "productive" audit fields.</seg>
<seg id="602">There were different views among the survey bodies regarding the analysis of such information, the benefits and the way in which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some senior finance directorates provide such information to the F Ä, but the F Ä is free to use it or not.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the system.</seg>
<seg id="606">The CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases based on a wide range of information.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT audits in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">The establishment of a special tax office for large companies is planned for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="610">Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="611">The emphasis is more on the selection of individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="612">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of the information in VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations as well as test notes, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the applicable taxation.</seg>
<seg id="614">Appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be introduced in order to reduce revenue losses at VAT and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="615">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="616">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation between the two audit institutions has proved its worth.</seg>
<seg id="619">In this way, necessary insights into the systems used in both countries could be gained: This concerns in particular: Intra-community transactions, risk management at the VAT in particular with regard to the selection of risky transactions, debt recovery of VAT receivables and VAT audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="620">The audit revealed differences in VAT fraud detection strategies and in the systems described above.</seg>
<seg id="621">These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="622">They can also be used to initiate a discussion with the interested parties as to which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud, for example in the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The experience and insights gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of VAT in the future.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communique</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the presidents of the Czech Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors.</seg>
