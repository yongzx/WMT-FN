<seg id="2">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="3">High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and increasing living standards in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economical passenger and freight traffic is an important task of the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="6">It requires a high degree of organizational, technical and financial efforts.</seg>
<seg id="7">When building and expanding a sustainable European transport infrastructure, it is often necessary to make difficult compromises with European and national political goals, such as protecting the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction of the transport infrastructure is complex, precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures.</seg>
<seg id="9">When planning and awarding the construction of traffic routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources through careful action and decision-making and use them for other useful purposes.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of state auditing authorities is to identify deficiencies that stand in the way of optimum economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the expenditure for the construction of traffic facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The auditing authorities should not only inform the administrations of the shortcomings identified, but also make suggestions for improvement for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ), carried out parallel audits of the expenditure for the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway (Autobahn D 8 in the Czech Republic and the A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The two highways are connected by a border bridge financed jointly by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the resources used in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">As part of the cooperation with the BRH, the NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000 the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract to build the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">In accordance with the planning progress, the completion date was finally set at the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the award procedure, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the construction time available.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor assured the accelerated construction of the bridge until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs for this.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint audit activity, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.</seg>
<seg id="24">A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square meter.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis showed that the border bridge under the large bridges with lengths of over 100 m was the most expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was also due to the price increase resulting from the delays in the award.</seg>
<seg id="27">The comparison of the prices for the tunnel structures showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">BRH and NKÚ can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices for future checks of the cost-effectiveness of spending on transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both auditors recommend standardizing bridge constructions and executing steel composite and special constructions only where prestressed concrete constructions are inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The course of the exam was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their specialist knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of this report is the parallel examination of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The focus of the examination was on economy, economy and effectiveness of the use of funds.</seg>
<seg id="35">The BRH in Germany and the NKÚ in the Czech Republic conducted the parallel tests</seg>
<seg id="36">in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The NKÚ checked the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure for the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway in the amount of approx. CZK 20 billion gross (around € 690 million).</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, € 64 million will be made available from EU structural funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">Regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ, the BRH had already checked the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway from 2003 to 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of approx. € 670 million, € 277 million will be co-financed from European funds (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The Prague - Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - Central and Southeast Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,</seg>
<seg id="43">the A 17 from the border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the inspection, sections of the motorway close to the border were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both sections were opened to traffic on December 21, 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the motorway on the German side to Dresden is thus completed, the D 8 on the Czech side remains incomplete, since section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">The crossing of a landscape protection area in the Bohemian Uplands is planned here.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the traffic volume in 2008 in the section 0807 of the D8 motorway near the border will be 22,940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">German forecasts estimate the traffic volume on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at approx. 25,000 vehicles a day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a contract to merge the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border by building a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since both countries are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction measure was an important aspect of the parallel audits of both audit offices.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="53">From mid-2005, the two audit offices began to consider working together to examine the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany partially finances the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech road construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="58">There was no way for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2nd</seg>
<seg id="60">The NKÚ had no comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly in view of the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3rd</seg>
<seg id="62">The NKÚ also had to check the effectiveness of the expenditure. For this purpose, the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels should be examined, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">After preliminary negotiations, the Presidents of the two Court of Auditors signed an agreement on January 4, 2006 to coordinate the audits of the Prague - Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="64">The auditors of the two audit offices met approximately every six to eight weeks in the course of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="65">They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for checking the bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">The constant exchange of information was essential to the collaboration.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH was primarily concerned with the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the award procedure, the NKÚ mainly worked out the methodology for the analysis of the bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs, and with it the way in which the two audit offices complete their audits.</seg>
<seg id="69">For this reason, both authorities developed separate national reports on their test results.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.</seg>
<seg id="71">The collaboration ends with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 contract, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.</seg>
<seg id="74">Later they agreed to postpone the appointment until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as the client for the construction project.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany is financing 42.13% of the bridge construction.</seg>
<seg id="77">Initially, the RMD provided a prestressed concrete structure for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, however, the RMD agreed with its German partner on the construction of a steel composite structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">They justified this decision with the possible reduction in the number of pillar pairs from seven to five and the associated ecological benefits for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had shown the steel composite construction as the less expensive solution.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, this was based on a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,</seg>
<seg id="83">in fact it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award process, the RMD made serious mistakes</seg>
<seg id="85">by insufficiently preparing the tender documents and describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria inaccurately.</seg>
<seg id="86">These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Evaluation Committee and the Director General of the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="87">An unsuccessful bidder contested the result of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation by the Czech Cartel Office delayed the signing of the building contract for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a result, the summer construction season following the bid review was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in less time. This led to a significant price increase.</seg>
<seg id="91">The measures offered included the double assembly of the superstructures, the change of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.</seg>
<seg id="92">The contractor was also unable to procure the steel grade originally intended.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new steel grade - its higher costs of approx. The customer alone contributed € 4 million - made it possible to shorten the construction time intended for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the offer price of approx. The total cost of construction of the border bridge will increase significantly due to the acceleration measures and additional supplements.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened construction time alone led to a price increase of around € 5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">The costs are currently approx. € 25.9 million net (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both auditors examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and A 17 to identify the bridges, which were characterized by particularly high prices, and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="99">The investigation was based on mathematical-statistical methods.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels on the D 8 were compared to similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4 because there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="101">When preparing this part of the exam, it was important to have a precise definition of the price term.</seg>
<seg id="102">For the comparison of the bridge prices, both auditors agreed on detailed specifications, for example: using the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="103">(The VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and can change.) Not to consider the costs for special foundation measures, to use the rate of the European Central Bank of December 30, 2005 for currency conversion. (29 CZK = 1 €).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of various types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and different sizes are available on both the D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">To ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their type.</seg>
<seg id="106">The analyzes also took the bridge size into account within these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The investigation focused on this type of bridge, since the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematical-statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The investigation showed that the m² price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the size of the bridge (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per square meter.</seg>
<seg id="110">The correlation between price and size is more pronounced for German bridges than for Czech bridges (see figures below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two bridges were found on the A 17 and four on the D 8 with significantly higher prices.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges were determined partly by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified based on the distance to the regression curve).</seg>
<seg id="113">The atypical high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw final conclusions, the causes of the respective high price must be determined in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">For example, are due to uneconomical administrative acts, but also due to the requirements to protect the environment or other legitimate reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length suggested that the Czech concrete bridges were cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">This was supported by the lower labor costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">When evaluating the results, however, it was found that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">During joint discussions, two reasons for this were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mostly awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="122">This also enables medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of sections of motorway several kilometers long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Medium-sized companies cannot handle orders of this size.</seg>
<seg id="125">2nd</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge structures built is greater than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the NKÚ found that the construction of bridges is determined long before construction begins,</seg>
<seg id="128">even when the RMD submits the application for planning approval.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this point, she selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, economy plays a subordinate role in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">Only a thorough analysis of the construction industries in both countries would have made a final conclusion regarding bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have gone beyond the scope of this examination.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany did not reveal any significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The considerable price differences can be the result of an under-developed competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow any general conclusions to be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="136">Efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden - Prague motorway</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government adopted the plan to expand the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The gradual expansion of the D 8 from Prague to the state border with Germany was planned.</seg>
<seg id="140">The route section 0805 through the Bohemian Uplands should be built before the route section 0807 near the border.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic finances the D 8 as part of program funding.</seg>
<seg id="142">Program number 327 220 “Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague - Ústí nad Labem - Czech German state border” defines two goals:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">as a national goal: to improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;</seg>
<seg id="145">2nd</seg>
<seg id="146">as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.</seg>
<seg id="147">The program envisaged the completion of the section through the Bohemian Uplands in June 2008 and the section 0807 near the border in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical with the time of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The NKÚ determined that the planning approval decision had already been made for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Uplands.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental groups have sued this decision.</seg>
<seg id="151">A final judgment is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="152">In comparison to the schedule provided in the program documentation, a delay in the completion of route section No. 0805 by several years could not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the completion date of section 0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result, the construction of the section near the border did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD subjected the border section 0807 of the D 8 and section 0805 through the Bohemian Uplands to a profitability analysis in the years 1999 to 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">As investment costs, it set approx. € 639 million for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the economic analysis (EIRR = internal rate of return)</seg>
<seg id="158">Variant opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border-near section 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">Opening of all planned highways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Traffic volume in the northern part of the section near the border 22,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">Opening of all planned highways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic volume in the northern part of the section near the border 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic viability study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Uplands go under traffic at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the exam it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Uplands would not be opened on the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of December 31, 2005, the cost of both sections was € 897 million excluding VAT. and thus 27.4% higher than in the 2001 economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="168">There is also the danger that section 0805 will get another more complex course of the inland, which would impair the profitability of the project.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic viability analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the highway is economically justified given a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, a study on detour routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Uplands assumes a traffic volume of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day in 2007. The project is then below the profitability limit.</seg>
<seg id="171">A higher traffic volume on the routes, which are to replace the missing section by the Bohemian Uplands, is likely to result in traffic jams and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the section of the D 8 near the border will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the section of the D 8 near the border is therefore uneconomical.</seg>
<seg id="174">The construction of the A 17 also resulted in cost increases such as the construction of the two above. Sections of D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment for the 1992 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan, the Federal Ministry of Transport assumed investment costs of approx. € 320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">It determined a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime the costs have increased to approx. € 670 million increased and the benefit / cost ratio reduced by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">Regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ, the BRH had checked the efficiency of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway from 2003 to 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">He found that the authority responsible for the approval required an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="180">The BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the redundancy of the landscape tunnel in the course of the examination.</seg>
<seg id="181">This avoided € 10 million in construction costs and € 150,000 in annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">When examining the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was insufficiently prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">In the planning phase, the road construction administration decided not to record the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschen wall, as this was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was only when the tunneling reached the wall that she made up for it.</seg>
<seg id="186">It was shown that the rock was more weathered than assumed in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">Complex measures such as anchorages, injections and stone chip protection nets for around € 3.3 million were necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional services that were required anyway, such as securing the Dölzschen wall, but also for those that would not have been necessary if the construction had been properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="189">This includes expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€ 3.2 million), additional training of the tunneling team (€ 0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of the construction period (€ 7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">These additional expenses of around € 10.7 million are not offset by any permanent added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to request the Federal Ministry to better exercise its specialist supervision for large road construction measures.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, there should be an urgent need for road construction administrations to introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation met the expectations of both audit offices.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH received knowledge about the planning, awarding of contracts and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both auditors developed a database of bridge and tunnel prices that will be useful for future audits.</seg>
<seg id="196">The NKÚ determined that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and the carriageway of the D 8 did not differ from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors from both SAIs involved in the collaboration gained valuable experience that will be useful in future audits.</seg>

<seg id="28">Value Added Tax Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Audit of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Audit Office ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on June 8, 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the tests was drawn up in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI test standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period covered the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of the parallel test</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audit of sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two audit offices.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the focus on information exchange in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 and Commission 1925/2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, e.g. registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="35">The audit also covered the legal situation in the case of cross-border passenger transport by bus and the comparison of statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">When comparing the VAT administration systems in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among other things, the main criterion for registration is the exceeding of the turnover threshold laid down in the turnover tax law.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, the taxpayer receives a tax number that is only valid for domestic sales for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German is liable to make intra-Community sales, it must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="42">Since problems arise from the different registration procedures, the regulations should be standardized within the EC (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus is free of VAT, but there is a right to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, as far as the route goes through Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at the EC level to standardize the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of November 28, 2006 on the common sales tax system (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic taxable VAT returns only have to be submitted for tax periods during the year (month or quarter), taxpayers in Germany (monthly or quarterly) have</seg>
<seg id="49">Make advance sales tax returns and submit a sales tax return after the end of the calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="50">In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany have to submit sales tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="51">The introduction of the obligation to submit sales tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the ef ﬁ ciency of the Czech tax authorities (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="52">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="53">While the taxpayers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the tax authorities (FÄ), German taxpayers have to submit the summary reports to the CLO2.</seg>
<seg id="54">Accordingly, the information from the summary reports is available to the FÄ in the Czech Republic immediately after they have been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="55">The information from the summary reports is only available to German FAs after they have been processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="56">To combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community sales is needed as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="57">The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of sales and the update of the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="58">This would allow for a timely review of taxation in the Member State of the purchaser (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the area of ​​sales tax.</seg>
<seg id="60">When requests for information are received, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German tax authorities processed a significantly lower percentage of the requests for information within the specified period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the BRH recommended constant monitoring of the deadlines to the German CLO (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two member states is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC member states. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, the two auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community sales that were realized between Czech and German tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="69">Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using the legal options of the CLO where there were doubts about the correct taxation or suspected VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The SAIs found the following:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the FÄ took advantage of the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-determined the sales tax liability of the taxpayer concerned.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the taxpayers either illegally claimed the exemption from VAT or did not show the purchase of goods in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal requirements in the two Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the financial authorities of another Member State refused to provide the information requested.</seg>
<seg id="76">A number of cases were discovered in which taxpayers incorrectly reported sales in their summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in the MIAS was accordingly incorrect, so that the clerk (FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="79">Examination procedure in the CR</seg>
<seg id="80">The review was conducted from June 2006 to March 2007 by Department II - "Government Household Income" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">Audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The college of the NKÚ approved the examination findings on April 23, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Examination procedure in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The examination was carried out in the period from July 2006 to February 2007 by the traffic tax examination area and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase, the actual test started in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">Apart from interviews in the BMF and in the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files from the following FÄ were included in the audit:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg- North and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover-North, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn city center, Cologne center, Cologne Porz, Cologne south, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz south, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau .</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, discussions were held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">The examination results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two audit offices</seg>
<seg id="95">Ahead of the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives from both audit offices took place.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants in these meetings became familiar with the organization of financial management, sales tax legislation and the sales tax management system in the other country.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, a schedule for the further procedure was worked out and the following examination topics for the parallel examinations were determined: 1.</seg>
<seg id="100">Registration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="101">2nd</seg>
<seg id="102">Cross-border passenger transport by bus - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the way in which tax officials deal with requests for information and the review of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. Risk management in the VAT area.</seg>
<seg id="110">At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel examinations that had already been achieved.</seg>

<seg id="118">An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover has exceeded CZK 1,000,000 for the last 12 consecutive calendar months, will become active on the first day of the third month after the month in which it exceeded the threshold , liable to pay (§ 94 (1) of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., regarding sales tax; hereinafter “Law No. 235/2004”).</seg>
<seg id="119">The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration threshold.</seg>
<seg id="120">Current legislation does not allow taxpayers to register retrospectively if they have exceeded the registration deadline.</seg>
<seg id="121">An entrepreneur with legal domicile, place of business or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides VAT-liable services or VAT-exempt services with the right to deduct input tax must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, however, it fulfills other requirements specified in Law No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="122">An entrepreneur with legal domicile, place of business or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not fulfill any of the requirements specified in the law, can voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="123">Upon receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer, the registration process according to Law No. 337/1992 begins.</seg>
<seg id="124">Anyone wishing to register for VAT voluntarily must state in their application the key date from which they apply for registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax officer has the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. check the completed application for registration with all attachments.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts about the information provided, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or provide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="127">If the tax official has verified that the entrepreneur fulfills the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notification of the registration and the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="128">In the notification, the tax officer must indicate the effective date of registration for VAT and the assessment period for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">The assessment period is the calendar quarter; unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="130">If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the tax officer of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The issue of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.</seg>
<seg id="133">The taxpayer is required to provide the tax number each time they communicate (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. Law No. 235/2004 on the preparation of tax documents) 3.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax number contains the code "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification sign.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification sign, insofar as this is determined by a special law. In the case of legal entities, the general identifier is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions in Section 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite a corresponding request from the tax officer, the locally responsible finance officer must register him ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="137">A notification will also be issued about this, which will be sent to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorized to do business receives a tax number for any tax type when they first register.</seg>
<seg id="139">This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">Pursuant to Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on January 1, 2005, in the event of non-fulfillment of the VAT registration obligation, the tax officer can demand that the taxpayer pay up to 10% of the tax revenue that the Unlawful without taxation, for the period from the date from which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person until the date on which the registration as a taxable person was made by the tax official (Section 98 (1) of the Act) No. 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="141">Payment of the amount thus determined is considered a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="142">If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a person liable for VAT can be deleted for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Deletion of the registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the registration threshold (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="145">A taxpayer can request that his registration be deleted at the earliest one year after the effective date specified in the registration letter.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Deletion of the registration ex officio (Section 106 (7) of Law No. 235/2004) if: a) the taxpayer has not performed a service for a period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officer of the reasons for this, b ) the taxpayer has not fulfilled his obligations according to Law No. 235/2004, c) the previous taxpayer no longer fulfills the requirements for the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Taxpayers without a legal seat, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and has neither its legal seat, place of business or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic nor a taxable foreigner who lives in the Czech Republic provides services and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235/2004 (“non-resident entrepreneur”) becomes taxable with the provision of the service concerned.</seg>
<seg id="148">He must apply for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.</seg>
<seg id="149">He is obliged in this application to include all VAT ID numbers assigned to him in other Member States or third countries. specify.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, FA Prague 1 must register him retrospectively, since according to Law No. 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic was subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the event of retrospective registration, the FA Prague 1 must request the entrepreneurs concerned to provide proof (invoices or written explanations) of the performance.</seg>
<seg id="152">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, the FA Prague 1 has to request the presentation of the service-based contract documents.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, including 124 from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, including 233 from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is authorized to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur by January 31 of the following calendar year if the latter is obliged to submit tax returns or - declarations and tax payments not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="155">When examining the NKÚ it turned out that in the event of filing a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on January 25, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this return has not been received by the FA by January 31.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of deleting the registration, become known to the FA later than on January 31, a deletion of the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for sales tax in the Czech Republic is in the concerned Calendar year no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of taxpayers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">According to the provisions of the tax code (§§ 137, 138 AO), every business must be registered with the municipality and / or the responsible tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">This registration must be made no later than one month after commencing business activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the responsible tax office determines that a business activity has been started but not registered, it can also register the taxpayer with retroactive effect ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers in Germany, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register for sales tax purposes if they meet the requirements in Section 2 of the German Sales Tax Act (UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the amount of sales achieved.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">Special FÄ are responsible for entrepreneurs resident abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of April 30, 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered with it; as of March 1, 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.</seg>
<seg id="168">According to the BRH's findings, these FÄs with special responsibilities frequently refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons with residence in the new medium or Eastern European member states of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the free movement of workers was still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed people attempted to circumvent these restrictions by starting their own business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These (bogus) self-employed do not meet the requirements for recognition as entrepreneurs specified in § 2 UStG, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working hours and the type of work performed.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, the entrepreneur has to fill out a questionnaire from the responsible FA and provide information on the company and the business activity carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the organizational units generally responsible for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="174">With the help of this form, a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer is carried out before the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits are the identification number for the relevant FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department within the FA is responsible, the following five (or four) digits are the identification code for the taxpayer, which is the last digit always a check digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries, he needs a VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="179">The VAT ID no. is automatically allocated by the CLO when the taxpayer declares intra-Community deliveries in his advance sales tax returns or in his annual sales tax return.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT ID no. is made up of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On application (e.g. if he stops doing business), but only after all taxation processes have been completed (assessment of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he is no longer doing business.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends. on the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO about the deletion of the sales tax number so that the validity of the VAT ID no. can be ended at this time.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the sales tax law (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay sales tax in the following cases: 1. sales in the previous calendar year plus the sales tax incurred did not exceed the amount of € 17,500 and 2. in the following year the amount of Probably not exceed € 50,000.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to invoice sales tax to other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and submit an annual sales tax return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small business owner can declare § 19 (1) UStG not to apply.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration is binding for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">He can then invoice sales tax and deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (Section 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The prerequisite for this is that they only generate tax-free sales and do not deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The fiscal representative fulfills the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices must state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first prerequisite for registration (among other things) is that the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="197">If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences may occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax when he first registers.</seg>
<seg id="200">If he registers for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number only for domestic sales.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community sales, he must specifically assign a VAT ID number. apply for.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community sales, can lead to considerable misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-tier system enables retrospective (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the responsible FA.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retrospective registration enables a correct assessment of sales tax for previous assessment periods, in particular an exact estimate of the sales tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">Since the different registration procedures lead to problems, the regulations for the entire EC should be standardized.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.</seg>
<seg id="208">This should be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.</seg>
<seg id="209">This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business activity, the responsible FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which is given as the VAT ID no. serves.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID number. give.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on implementing an IT process for managing the numbers is not yet complete.</seg>
<seg id="213">Cross-border passenger transport by bus</seg>
<seg id="214">The legal regulations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">In accordance with the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235/2004, the transport of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT since 1 May 2004 and there is a right to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="216">The VAT exemption also applies if the transport is carried out by persons who are registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners who are taxable in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return trip is a separate transport operation.</seg>
<seg id="218">If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the international transport of passengers by bus, they are not obliged to register themselves as VAT-liable in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">Cross-border passenger transport was exempt from VAT in the Czech Republic due to the Act on Accession of the Czech Republic, Appendix No. V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The stated position says:</seg>
<seg id="220">"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77/388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 in Appendix F to the Directive, maintain the tax exemption for international passenger transport either until the requirement of Article 28 ( 4) the Directive is complied with or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States. "</seg>
<seg id="221">The legal regulations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of November 28, 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.</seg>
<seg id="223">Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the part of the transport service attributable to the domestic tax is taxable in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">German taxation also makes no distinction between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxpayer transports people through Germany, the part of the transport accounted for in Germany is considered taxable transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the responsible FA.</seg>
<seg id="228">The latter registers it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus named in the taxpayer's registration.</seg>
<seg id="229">The entrepreneur has to state his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of March 1, 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport service is performed for an entrepreneur domiciled in Germany, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the sales tax himself to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="232">In its place, the domestic customer of the services must pay the sales tax to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is referred to as "tax liability shift" and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax authorities have several means of checking the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:</seg>
<seg id="234">Customs' mobile control groups check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad that are used to transport people through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each test, the mobile control groups submit an inspection report to the responsible FA.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay the sales tax before continuing his journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident taxpayer can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the FA has doubts about the correctness of a VAT return, it can order an examination to be carried out in the FA, or it can use the means of administrative assistance specified in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 (see No. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally stipulated sales tax, the FA can request administrative assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to check the sales tax return or compliance with the tax liability by a non-resident bus operator as too expensive in relation to the low revenue from sales tax on taxable passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, checking the books of a non-resident taxpayer causes disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter has to check the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language but also foreign accounting principles.</seg>
<seg id="243">Accordingly, such a check is likely to take more time than a resident taxpayer, although the check is limited to the passenger transport taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer has to accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, the taxpayer for each Member State in which only a single passenger transport is carried out must fulfill all existing tax law obligations in the various languages ​​and using the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="246">The correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services thus leads to a disproportionately high administrative effort.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation is different in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, the transport of passengers between different EC member states and between the member states and third countries is exempt from VAT due to the law on the EC accession of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the transport performance is subject to sales tax in accordance with the route of the journey on German territory.</seg>
<seg id="251">If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the responsible FA beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="252">This registers the taxpayer who has to declare the taxable portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Law enforcement in Germany is very time consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transportation as their business purpose.</seg>
<seg id="255">The tax revenue in question is relatively low in relation to administrative expenses.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States - which levy sales tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common sales tax system - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid the disproportionately high cost of tax assessment, international passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state in which transportation begins or where the service provider is located.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28 November 2006.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">Unless the law provides otherwise, the entrepreneur is also obliged, even if no tax liability has arisen, to submit a VAT return on the form specified by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the taxation period.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax liability arises at the end of the deadline for submitting the VAT return. Exempt from this regulation is the sales tax on the import of goods according to Law No. 235/2004. Here the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If the deductible input tax is above average as a result of a refund, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of this input tax deduction, without the need to submit an application.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit does not apply in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure regarding the taxpayer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">According to Section 73 (11) of Law No. 235/2004, the right to deduct input tax can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last taxation period of the calendar year in which the right to input tax deduction arose.</seg>
<seg id="267">After this period, the input tax deduction can still be claimed within three years after the end of the taxation period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">An amendment to Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on January 1, 2005, permits the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct input tax could have been asserted for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">A taxpayer must submit a supplementary VAT return if: a) the total of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax liability, but only change previous information, c) he according to Section 49 of Law No. 235/2004 makes corrections to the sales tax rate and tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="271">A taxpayer can submit a supplementary VAT return if the total of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxpayer must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the relevant facts were established.</seg>
<seg id="273">The sales tax return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or using a data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="274">Delivery via the Internet can be done with or without a certi ﬁ ed electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">If it takes place without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on a data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="276">The form for the sales tax return contains separate lines to indicate the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.</seg>
<seg id="277">The value of purchased services must be stated in separate lines on the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some sections are used for automated primary controls within the framework of the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of goods delivered to other persons registered as taxable persons in other EC member states is compared with the data given by the Czech taxpayers in their summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="280">With the help of the MIAS, the value of purchases of goods from other Member States by persons registered there as taxable is compared with the information in the summary reports of taxpayers from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">As part of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check on the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="282">This is done automatically because the sales tax return cannot be processed without prior checking.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility check includes a calculation of the criteria for credibility and an assessment of the risks of the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">According to the provisions of § 37 (1) of Law No. 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to meet their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law .</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="286">During its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxpayer if the VAT return was not submitted.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly sales tax returns and the annual sales tax return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit advance sales tax returns must nevertheless submit an annual sales tax return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small business owners who are not obliged to pay sales tax must submit an annual sales tax return.</seg>
<seg id="291">The taxpayers are generally obliged to submit a sales tax advance notification by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the sales tax arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the sales tax liability in the previous year was more than € 6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly sales tax returns by the 10th day after the end of the month in question at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer can also opt to submit monthly sales tax returns if they have received an amount of € 6,136 in the previous year (Section 18 (2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">If the annual sales tax was not more than € 512, neither advance sales tax returns nor sales tax returns are to be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="295">A resulting sales tax liability is payable 10 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="296">A refund can lead to a more thorough review by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no (legal) deadlines for processing sales tax returns and for reimbursing sales tax overpayments.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to receive a timely refund, security can be offered for the refund amount.</seg>
<seg id="299">In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German sales tax law allows an extension of these (submission or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">If it is granted, advance sales tax returns and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly reports, however, a special advance payment is required.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment will be offset against the sales tax liability determined for the December pre-registration period.</seg>
<seg id="304">If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur has to submit a corrected advance VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no "supplementary" VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the VAT return to be submitted by May 31 of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT return, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corrections to this VAT return for the benefit or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was submitted.</seg>
<seg id="308">After this four-year period, a sales tax return can usually only be corrected in the event of a frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Taxpayers must submit advance sales declarations electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual VAT return can be submitted either on paper or on the Internet with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If the tax is submitted without certification, the taxpayer must also submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">If no advance tax returns or declarations are submitted, the tax authorities are entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover generated by the taxpayer6.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of late delivery, the taxpayer can be charged with a delay surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of € 25,000).</seg>
<seg id="315">In an earlier inspection, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not charge this late surcharge.</seg>
<seg id="316">In the cases where the FÄ charged the late surcharges, the amount was set inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The late payment surcharge therefore fails to reduce the average delay, especially when submitting the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The form of the sales tax return contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or purchases.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable sales are to be stated in a separate line of the sales tax return.</seg>
<seg id="321">The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by dedicated personnel.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data of electronically submitted tax returns are immediately available to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="323">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="324">After all data have been electronically recorded, they are subjected to a risk management process and a case selection is made based on certain standards.</seg>
<seg id="325">The sales tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk using the automatically generated test notes (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax authorities only have to make a rough estimate of the sales tax liability, it still has to be as precise as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers are required to submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the taxation period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the taxpayer's turnover, the taxation period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, taxpayers are required to submit their pre-registrations no later than 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annual VAT return must be submitted by May 31 of the following year at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has several advantages and disadvantages:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly advance returns by submitting a single VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">- If the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community sales, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;</seg>
<seg id="335">- The federal states only compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers when the annual VAT returns have usually been processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This tax obligation enables the German tax authorities to check compliance with the sales ceiling for small businesses.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the responsible FA can compare the annual VAT return with the corresponding direct tax returns and the annual accounts of the company in question.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can only check the amount of sales based on the submitted income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are required to submit advance sales tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to submit tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the ef ﬁ ciency of the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary messages</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235/2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State must submit corresponding summary reports (hereinafter “ZM”).</seg>
<seg id="345">In ZM, the value of the delivered goods is always given in the Czech currency, broken down according to VAT number 7, the individual taxable person under which they are registered in the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="346">Information on services is not given in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="347">The taxpayers with a calendar month or quarterly taxation period must submit the ZM to the locally responsible FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.</seg>
<seg id="348">Inaccurate data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the discovery of the error.</seg>
<seg id="349">Incorrect data in the CM is always replaced by the data from the correction CM.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similar to the tax returns, the taxpayers can also submit the ZM electronically.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a taxpayer does not hand in a DM or a correction DM, although he is obliged to do so in accordance with Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer must ask him to surrender the relevant DM, indicating the consequences of the non-surrender. If non-monetary obligations are not met, the tax officer is authorized to repeatedly impose fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No. 337/1992.</seg>
<seg id="352">During its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄ mostly did not use their authority to impose fines on their offending taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="353">Taxpayers, in particular, are not sufficiently motivated to fulfill their duties when paying the ZM, since the failure to submit a ZM does not affect the amount of their sales tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">Pursuant to Section 102 (5) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the CM or rectification CM, to remove any ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">If they do not match</seg>
<seg id="356">8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxpayer corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on its own initiative or upon request.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax officer has to correct the data on goods deliveries to other Member States in the ATIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">- the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the CM (or correcting CM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correcting CM,</seg>
<seg id="359">- the tax officer has proven the incorrectness of the information reported by the taxpayer in the CM or the correcting CM.</seg>
<seg id="360">Corrections entered by the tax officer without the taxpayer having submitted a corrective DM do not replace the taxpayer's duty to submit a corrective DM, but only correct the data in the MIAS so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from the CM are sent to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of ​​VAT may transmit and receive this data.</seg>
<seg id="363">This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the department for international administrative assistance in the area of ​​sales tax in the Ministry of Finance). The CLO automatically receives the message "O_MCTL" from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect VAT ID numbers that were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the incorrect VAT ID no. used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the wrong VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="366">The list contains a "Report a doubt about VAT number".</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax officer reviews the data and enters the result of the review into the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return intended for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of differences between the values ​​of the purchases made by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return and the values ​​for the delivery of goods specified by the supplier from the other Member State in its CM are forwarded by the CLO to the responsible FA for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="370">The clerks there must investigate the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="371">Three different situations can then occur:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value specified by the Czech purchaser in the relevant sections of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries specified by suppliers from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax officer checks the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The difference is zero.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his CM) or from a change in the information in the sales tax return (the Czech taxpayer now makes a supplementary sales tax return on his own initiative).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the tax official's discretion to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="377">c) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer stated in his VAT return, is higher than the value of their goods deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here again it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="379">After verifying the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the tax officer enters the results of his verification in ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">These results are sent to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of transactions submitted by the CLO for review can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 from graphic no. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="382">The graphic 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due among other things that the Czech CLO raised the threshold for a case selection taking into account the minimum amount for a request for information to the other EC member states.</seg>
<seg id="384">Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be due to an error by the domestic purchaser.</seg>
<seg id="385">There may also be an error by the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries are indicated differently in the CM in the individual EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="386">Table 1 shows the most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions from the audited FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-community deliveries from Germany to other EC member states or participate in triangular transactions must submit ZM every quarter, in which intra-community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="390">If a long-term extension for the submission of advance sales tax returns is granted, this also applies to the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="391">The ZM are to be submitted to the KLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">Electronic submission has been mandatory since January 1, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="393">The responsible FA can allow exemptions for certain taxpayers to avoid unreasonable hardships.</seg>
<seg id="394">If the taxpayer determines that the CM was defective, he is obliged to submit a correction CM within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">If the ZM is not submitted, the CLO initiates enforcement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="396">This includes the following steps: - First reminder - Second reminder, combined with the threat of a penalty payment, and - Determination of the penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German tax code allows the imposition of a penalty payment of up to € 25,000 (Section 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of € 125, 250 and 500 in three stages.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxpayer acts improperly if he intentionally or carelessly fails to submit a CM correctly, incompletely or in a timely manner or if he does not correct a CM or not in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="399">This violation can result in a fine of up to € 5,000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ in the MIAS because the CLO is solely responsible for processing the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="401">The ZM data is only saved with the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="402">The information from the summary reports is only available to the FÄ after the CLO has processed them.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing ZM are regulated in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The ZM data must be saved within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in MIAS).</seg>
<seg id="405">In case of incorrect VAT ID no. In the ZM of German taxpayers, the German CLO receives a message "O_MCTL" from the other member state.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to get the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to him to request the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="409">In the course of its review, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs have the VAT ID no. corrected at the request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, remembering, threatening and setting up to three consecutive fines takes too much time if a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">The cases that were ultimately reported to the responsible FÄ were usually completed within one to two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The relevant FA refused the tax exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.</seg>
<seg id="413">Did the taxpayer provide the correct VAT number. the FA asked him to submit a corrected CM to the CLO because the FAs cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the submission of the corrected CM.</seg>
<seg id="415">For this reason, the taxpayers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data in the VAT returns, the information on goods deliveries made in advance VAT returns or the VAT return is not compared with the corresponding information in the CM before this data is sent to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This comparison can only be carried out by the FÄ. This is usually done when preparing a special VAT audit.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data received from other Member States is processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT ID no. are recognized and reported to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data are used for the control of income tax in the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="420">As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with the data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notices are created and sent to the responsible FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="422">This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a list of the acquisition dates of all VAT payers is created later and forwarded to the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="423">The risk management system (RMS) for the investment process then compares this data with that for intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">The system completely (only) checks those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must submit a DM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="427">The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values ​​of the intra-community deliveries reported by the taxpayers in the ZM are compared with the values ​​of the intra-community deliveries indicated by the same taxpayers in their sales tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are taken into account in the tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to submit quarterly DM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.</seg>
<seg id="431">Since January 1, 2007, the taxpayers have to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="432">The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the taxpayers in the CM only state the deliveries of goods.</seg>
<seg id="434">The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.</seg>
<seg id="435">Because of this restricted access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID no. not corrected even if the taxpayer has the correct VAT number. informed the FA.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax authorities do not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German taxpayers in their advance tax returns with the information provided by the relevant ZM.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of the pre-registration and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO passes the MIAS data on to other member states.</seg>
<seg id="438">Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="439">In the Czech Republic, the data on goods delivered to Czech taxpayers submitted by other Member States is compared with the data on purchases of goods that the Czech taxpayers have stated in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The Czech CLO carries out the adjustment separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FÄ for examination.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities do not generally check the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general check is only carried out on taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions by other taxpayers if the RMS creates an audit notice or the taxpayer has been selected for an audit anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the FÄ from clarifying the reasons for the differences that occur.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">To combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current system of the ZM, especially MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information that can be as much as six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the taxpayers were required to surrender monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly submission would only increase the bureaucratic effort insignificantly, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are in any case obliged to submit monthly sales tax returns or advance registrations and the ZM does not need more information than for the sales tax returns or advance returns.</seg>
<seg id="451">To avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the submission of the sales tax returns or advance registrations.</seg>
<seg id="452">An obligation to submit ZM monthly would, however, cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community purchases and would increase the data flows between the CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006 the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly CM.</seg>
<seg id="454">The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other member states could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In order for the obligation to submit monthly ZM to take effect, it is necessary to agree on a uniform monthly fee at European level so that the MIAS data can be updated on a monthly basis.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic in foreign trade.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total turnover of intra-Community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both audit offices requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID numbers. in the O_MCTL messages that were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual quarters checked.</seg>
<seg id="461">This data can be found in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">They show significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO relates the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO relates its figures to the calendar quarter in which O_MCTLMeldung was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information at level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information enables tax officials to receive information from other Member States on intra-Community turnover and on the taxpayers who carried it out.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative assistance in the field of value added tax, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003") ), distinguishes between two basic types of information exchange: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information (RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or responses to a received RFI through the finance directorate to the CLO. This ensures that the information provided in the standardized SCAC form is translated into the foreign language and forwarded to the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It takes care of their translation into Czech and their distribution to the responsible FÄ for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the NKÚ.</seg>
<seg id="474">Of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the remaining one case, no response had been sent to Germany until the NKÚ had checked it. More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Graph 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">Out of the total of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 responded (i.e. 40.6%) within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this period and in 19 cases was currently the review by the NKÚ has not yet received a response from Germany (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information based on the information given).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in graphic no. 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of the intra-Community sales values ​​stated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in graphic no. 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The graphic above shows that the sales checked in connection with requests for information mostly had values ​​of over € 60,000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax officials from other Member States are often given unsolicited information that is important in determining VAT.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.</seg>
<seg id="484">“Automatic exchange” according to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of predetermined information to other Member States at regular, predetermined intervals without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="485">“Structured automatic exchange” means the systematic transmission of predetermined information to another Member State without prior request as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic informs the other Member States of the automatic exchange of information about deliveries of new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="487">The tax officer obtains this information from the pre-printed report on the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law No. 235/2004 and from a copy of the invoice issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing this form, the finance officer enters the required data in the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the finance department, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, these data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Czech Republic also provides the other Member States with information on mail-order sales that are tax-free in the country of origin, intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and potential “missing traders”.</seg>
<seg id="490">This information is transmitted to the other Member States on a spontaneous exchange of information using a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the locally responsible FA.</seg>
<seg id="493">The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by email directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is monolingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were submitted in order to ensure the taxation of employment in the other Member State or to demonstrate the tax exemption of intra-Community delivery from Germany to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of € 15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding sales that are below the minimum amount limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO will translate the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are neither in German nor in English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To answer the request for information, the CLO forwards it to the responsible FA and refers to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of German financial management.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with deadlines, it does not have the necessary human resources to remind the FÄ to respond to unresolved requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The FÄ receive the required information by letter from the taxpayer or by carrying out an external audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.</seg>
<seg id="504">With this short and ﬂ exible form of audit, an announcement to the taxpayer is not necessary and it has proven itself when examining a single turnover.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the automatic exchange of information, Germany transmits the following information to the other Member State: - via VAT number assigned to companies that are located in other EC Member States, - about the reimbursement of input tax to entrepreneurs who are based in other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC member states with the following information as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT number, b. Distance selling (mail order) to other EC member states that are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data provided by other Member States, i. intra-community deliveries of items that were incorrectly subject to taxation in Germany by the taxpayer, e. potential "missing traders" who have made intra-community sales, regardless of whether their VAT ID. is still valid or has already been deleted, and f. Taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have a VAT ID no. misused.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the locally responsible FÄ, who transmit the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information provided into the English or German language, the German FÄ follow the instructions to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany between May 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005, the NKÚ determined that the Czech tax authorities processed 74.5% of requests for information within the three-month period, while requests for information sent to Germany by the German tax authorities were only dealt with within this period in 40.6% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="513">The German CLO notifies the FÄ of the three-month period, but does not monitor compliance with it.</seg>
<seg id="514">Due to the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of requests for information that are answered with a time limit.</seg>
<seg id="515">That is why the BRH recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has changed in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices to respond to the outstanding requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial management deal with risk management in the area of ​​sales tax.</seg>
<seg id="521">The following organizational units within the Czech Ministry of Finance are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The department for methodology and economic administration of sales tax or its department for risk management is concerned with identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.</seg>
<seg id="523">At the national level, this body coordinates the criteria for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates risky goods, conceptually prepares risk management in the area of ​​sales tax and works in this area with the responsible EC institutions and the other member states.</seg>
<seg id="525">The department for international administrative assistance in the area of ​​sales tax ensures, among other things. for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, does public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.</seg>

<seg id="529">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="530">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="531">The Department for Methodology of Tax Audit and Tax Investigation leads among other things Risk analyzes in the context of the methodical control of tax audits, defines priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of the cases to be examined, creates risk analyzes to combat tax evasion and in this connection collects information from the financial administration and other sources and makes suggestions for measures Combating tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Tax investigation offices exist with the finance directorates. Her duties include the search for taxpayers and industries that pose a risk in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. internet business, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxpayers (e.g. in the internet service, employment agency, electronic and print media industries, etc.) ), the investigation of links in chain fraud cases and the information of the local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Special examination units were set up in 12 selected FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="534">These have regional responsibility and, based on the relevant authorization, carry out tax audits outside of the local area of ​​responsibility of the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up special audit units arose from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain stores.</seg>
<seg id="536">These special units check according to the needs of the tax investigation offices or concentrate on taxpayers with certain activities, multinational companies and taxpayers with particularly high sales.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of ​​sales tax have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task "Credibility of the sales tax returns" for assessing the riskiness of tax returns submitted, - the task "selection of the taxpayers to be checked", whereby the taxpayers to be checked are based on certain Criteria are selected - the "MIAS" task, which gives tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The “MIAS” task enables the following: - Checking the validity of the VAT ID number. from taxpayers from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxpayer as stated in the CM by all suppliers of the taxpayer concerned from other Member States, - compilation of a list of taxpayers who have not submitted a CM, - formal Checking the information that taxpayers in the Czech Republic have provided in their CM before this information is passed on to other Member States, - compilation of a list of taxpayers whose VAT returns do not match the information on goods delivered to other Member States with the information in the CM , - Preparation of a list of taxpayers whose VAT returns do not match the information on the value of goods purchased from other Member States with the information in the CM of all their suppliers from other Member States13.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their duties to combat tax evasion, the tax officers have access to the data from government agencies such as the commercial register, land registry, motor vehicle register, trade register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information on this can be found in section 4.4.1 Submitting and processing summary reports in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Because of their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (particularly the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="543">There are joint working groups for development, but neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a complete database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the CLO level, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as “KUSS” - coordination office for special sales tax audits and tax investigation measures) collects the audit findings on cases of fraud in the OPUS database.</seg>
<seg id="545">In cooperation with the federal states, another database called ZAUBER was set up at KUSS. There the tax offices can enter the names of discovered missing traders or sales tax fraudsters and also query them.</seg>
<seg id="546">The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experiences of the KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their work in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">Experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.</seg>
<seg id="549">The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. other member states that appear in the ZM of German taxpayers are carried out by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal check is carried out before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus also its benefits (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">Checking the validity in the VAT ID no. is based on the O_MCTL identifiers provided by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID numbers, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the CLO's RMS relies on the MIAS data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of messages to detect suspected missing traders. As a guide, certain characteristics are used that usually occur in carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="553">The federal states' FÄ are instructed to process these notifications and in certain cases have to forward the results of their investigations to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="554">The BRH's audit confirmed that all available features must be included to reasonably predict a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing primarily on a company's sales).</seg>
<seg id="555">Accordingly, the BRH recommended that the BMF work with combinations of various points of reference when preparing the notifications.</seg>
<seg id="556">The risk management system should also take other indications into account, e.g. the payment behavior of the taxpayer, the economic sector or the shareholding structure of the company.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of advance sales tax returns and annual declarations.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the system creates a list of those taxpayers who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their advance sales tax returns or annual returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO for monitoring the complete delivery of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, with this type of risk management, the purchases specified by the taxpayer in his annual sales tax return are compared with the data in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="561">The federal state financial administrations avoid comparing the quarterly data as this would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g .:</seg>
<seg id="562">- The supplier and the buyer assume different times for the execution of intra-Community sales;</seg>
<seg id="563">- Different accounting records and tax returns for discounts and rebates.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other clues (e.g. company name, age of owner / partner, number of employees and method of payment of the taxpayer) .</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which enables a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter “risk manager”) to program their own rules so that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out.</seg>
<seg id="566">This system is used by the FÄ when the sales tax returns are processed.</seg>
<seg id="567">This gives the responsible FA the information from the RMS before the sales tax is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data from evidenced cases of evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The system creates a monthly list of tax cases where there are indications of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list, the responsible FÄ decides on the examination of the taxpayer concerned.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.</seg>
<seg id="574">In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called data mining system) calculates how likely it is that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">Then it creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">On the basis of this list, the FÄ selects the taxpayer concerned for the examination and reports the examination results to the relevant data center.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether the effects hoped for will actually occur during actual use.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although it is not possible in the present report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have determined that each member state has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European country has its particular strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">Sales tax fraud - especially carousel fraud - has proven to be not a national but a European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.</seg>
<seg id="587">A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in every EC member state. If this does not happen, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="589">The tax shortfalls caused by VAT fraud across Europe do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is located.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any other Member State involved in the fraud can be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">Therefore, there should be a European exchange of experience about the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected results from the review of individual sales As part of the parallel reviews, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or</seg>
<seg id="593">Acquisitions that were the subject of the international exchange of information between the tax authorities of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two courts of auditors jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, the implementation of which was in doubt, or which the taxpayers of the two countries declared differently in the tax returns or the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight business transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, in 43 cases, the NKÚ checked the values ​​of intra-Community business with Germany, which the Czech taxpayer had stated in their tax returns and tax returns, based on notifications from the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="598">The relevant information was only exchanged via the CLO on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases revealed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth € 60,500 from a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only € 29,869, the Czech tax authorities made a request to Germany to check the value of the goods delivered.</seg>
<seg id="603">In its response to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer concerned had goods worth € 27,381 to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, goods in the third quarter of € 31,997 and in the fourth quarter of € € 10,276 delivered.</seg>
<seg id="604">It also emerged from the answer that the VAT ID no. of the German taxpayer was only valid from September 28, 2004. However, the German CLO had granted another application by the German taxpayer and the validity of the VAT ID number. brought forward retrospectively to May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on this information, it was a matter of an (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="607">In an inquiry to the relevant tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted additional VAT returns for the individual (intra-year) tax periods in 2004, during which he declared a higher value of the acquisitions from other Member States and at the same time the deduction of input tax on purchases from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the responsible clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared purchases also included the value of the deliveries of the above. German suppliers was included.</seg>
<seg id="609">In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH determined that the German supplier had been registered as liable to VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, when registering, he had not applied for the assignment of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number that applied exclusively to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is generally not possible in Germany, a taxable person has a VAT ID number retrospectively. to assign, the responsible clerk of the German financial administration did so in 2006 retrospectively to May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO shares a VAT ID number. retrospectively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO responds to the delay after the taxpayer's application for a VAT ID no. caused.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO issues the VAT ID number. retrospectively, because the entrepreneur does not have a valid VAT ID number for an intra-Community delivery according to § 6 UStG. needed.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) VAT ID number. of his supplier to explain the intra-community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these procedural differences between the member states, the German CLO issued the VAT ID number. retrospectively in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2nd</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="618">From the MIAS data, the date of registration is March 5, 2005, while October 1, 2004 is given in a registration certificate issued by the locally responsible German FA.</seg>
<seg id="619">In their reply, the German authorities announced that the German taxpayer was registered on October 1, 2004, but for organizational reasons did not have a VAT ID number in Germany until February 16, 2005. get allocated.</seg>
<seg id="620">When asked by the locally responsible Czech tax officer, the NKÚ was informed that the tax officer had carried out a sales tax assessment for the taxable person for the taxation periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">During this inspection, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 that he had provided to the German taxpayer before he was registered for VAT (i.e. before October 1, 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">The (Czech) tax office set a tax liability of CZK 1,880 against the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="623">Based on the request of the NKÚ, the BRH determined that the German taxpayer had the VAT ID no. had only been allocated when he registered his company founded in 2004 with the FA on February 16, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the FA registered him retrospectively from October 1, 200415 for VAT purposes in order to monitor the submission of the VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this VAT return, the taxable intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic stated in the value of 160 € (approx. 5,000 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In his sales tax return for September 2004 as well as in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable goods delivery to the value of CZK 114,615 stated to a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="627">When checking the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that this registration was only valid from November 11, 2004 and thus after the goods were delivered to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech taxpayer made a supplementary VAT return, declaring sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">In an inquiry to the locally responsible FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ determined that the Czech taxpayer subsequently made an application to resume the taxation procedure for the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax authorities that the German taxpayer had been registered since January 1, 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Accordingly, the Czech tax officer checked the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">It emerged from the German information that the German taxpayer was only on November 11, 2004, i.e. a VAT ID number after the date of delivery of the goods. had been allocated.</seg>
<seg id="632">As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the application to resume the taxation process.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH determined that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place because the German taxpayer only had a VAT ID number on November 11, 2004. had received.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the sales tax thereon and also demanded the reimbursement of input taxes of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">The BRH also found that the company of the German taxpayer mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax officer.</seg>
<seg id="638">4th</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial officer checked the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxpayer from a German taxpayer worth € 22,686.</seg>
<seg id="640">In an inquiry to the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax officer had carried out an external audit with the Czech taxpayer to check whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer had paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods booked and paid.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return because the German supplier did not include his VAT number in the invoice. but only provided his tax number for business within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">According to the MIAS data, the German taxpayer is only from April 21, 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxpayer, registered for sales tax related to intra-community sales.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax authorities send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxpayer so that he could initiate a corresponding taxation procedure if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech FA considered this business as the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set sales tax on the purchase of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH found that under German law a taxable person who delivers goods to other member states does not have a VAT ID number. for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier only needs the VAT ID number. of the purchaser in the other Member State and can demonstrate the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">In this case, sales under German tax law are a (tax-exempt) intra-Community delivery that should be subject to purchase taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this business transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community sales if these are below the minimum amount of € 15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth € 12,561 from a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax officer carried out an audit for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">As part of the intergovernmental administrative assistance, the Czech tax authorities used a SCAC form to request that this delivery of goods be checked.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech taxpayer declared that he had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and had not booked the purchase of the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax authorities rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was below € 15,000 and no other reason was given.</seg>
<seg id="655">As the Czech tax officer did not receive any documents for subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was unsuccessful and the original tax assessment was retained.</seg>
<seg id="656">Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH determined that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his sales tax return and in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to tax exemption was recognized.</seg>
<seg id="659">Based on the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">In section 4.6.1 it was shown that the responses of the German tax authorities to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than the responses of the Czech tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. During its review, the NKÚ found that on October 5, 2005 the Czech tax authorities had sent a request for information about the value of goods delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxpayer reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth € 86,307; however, the Czech taxpayer only declared the purchase of goods worth € 35,314 for the same period in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to the request for information submitted to the Czech Republic on May 9, 2006, i.e. After the expiry of the maximum processing time specified in Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, the German side announced that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Because the German tax authorities did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax authorities did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, a Czech tax officer used a SCAC form to request a check of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person for € 1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with indications of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The NKÚ found that at the time of its review, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.</seg>
<seg id="667">In an inquiry to the local tax officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not declared the delivery of new vehicles to this German taxpayer in the amount of CZK 11,816,103 in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer submitted a corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="669">Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the locally responsible FA for review.</seg>
<seg id="670">After the notification by the BRH, a special sales tax inspection was carried out for the German purchaser in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all the motor vehicles concerned had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold to other taxpayers in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth € 48,500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="672">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="673">When asked by the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Czech taxpayer did not make any tax returns even after the tax official requested it. As a result, on May 23, 2005, the FA set the sales tax liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero.</seg>
<seg id="675">On June 2, 2005, the CLO issued an instruction for the German taxpayer to check the above-mentioned delivery.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official, the tax official made a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the answer to the request for information was received on February 7, 2007, it was not known until the NKÚ's examination was completed how the Czech tax officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="678">Due to non-fulfillment of the obligations under the Czech sales tax law, the sales tax registration of the Czech taxpayer was deleted with effect from August 23, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial response was sent because at the time of the NKÚ and BRH examination, the responsible FA had not yet completed the external examination:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax officer used a SCAC form to request a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth € 16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with indications of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices for deliveries worth € 16,335 issued by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="683">Based on the request from the NKÚ, the BRH determined that the external audit carried out by the German FA at the purchaser in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German purchaser declared the purchase of goods worth € 16,335 twice in his VAT returns for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, a Czech tax officer used a SCAC form to request a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxable person for € 198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, showing signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax authorities sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, confirming that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany was still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="687">The NKÚ found that the locally responsible FA had carried out several external inspections at the Czech taxpayer to check the deduction of above-average input tax.</seg>
<seg id="688">However, no unjustified claim was found.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared the purchase of goods from other member states with a total value of € 579,114 for the relevant period in his VAT returns, and that the examination of the German FA by the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's CM.</seg>
<seg id="691">In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic discrepancies18 or incorrect declarations of sales as intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to data from MIAS, the Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth € 35,716 from the German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005; however, the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official and there was no business activity at the legal seat of the company, the Czech tax officer requested as part of the international exchange of information to check how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="695">The German response to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German tax authorities, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the address given and the goods were picked up by an agreed carrier.</seg>
<seg id="696">The total value of the order was € 155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth € 21,659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer an incorrect payment confirmation for the amount of € 155,153 in favor of the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After revealing the fraudulent behavior of the Czech purchaser, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the material supplied, with the exception of a part worth € 7,916.</seg>
<seg id="699">In an inquiry to the locally responsible FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ determined that the tax authorities, among other things, retrospectively taxed sales of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.</seg>
<seg id="700">Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier, after making corrections, had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth € 7,916.</seg>
<seg id="701">In accordance with German law, the German taxpayer declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction in the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="702">His ZM contained the following information regarding Czech taxpayers:</seg>
<seg id="703">12th</seg>
<seg id="704">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax authorities used a SCAC form to request a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to the request for information, the Czech taxpayer had delivered goods to the German taxpayer with a total value of € 396,126 and rendered services with a value of € 11,885 during the period in question.</seg>
<seg id="706">The NKÚ found that the Czech tax authorities had carried out an audit with the Czech taxpayer to examine this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the request for information, the Czech tax authorities announced that the Czech taxpayer had delivered and installed a production system for the German one.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after May 1st, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German taxpayer did not accept the assembled production system and claimed defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German plant for € 107,100 and € 11,885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German taxpayer received the invoices but did not recognize them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">When asked by the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all the invoices in the books of the Czech taxpayer had been properly recorded.</seg>
<seg id="713">The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 only included the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after May 1st, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH determined that the locally responsible FA came to the conclusion based on the response from the Czech tax authorities that these sales were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxpayer to the German taxpayer, including the installation.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of fulfillment of this so-called delivery of works is the place where the production system is installed.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German recipient of the work delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German sales tax law.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient can claim an input tax deduction of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">Since the VAT liability of the German taxpayer remained unchanged, the German FA did not make any adjustments to the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine worth € 58,000 from the German taxpayer C in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax official made a request to Germany to verify this information.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German taxable person C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxable person B in 2004, but had returned it to the German taxable person C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to information from the German tax authorities, the machine was not transported back to Germany but to the branch of German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">The response to the request for information further showed that the German taxable person C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxable person A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">The latter received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's branch in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since this delivery (from C to A) was only made within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">When asked by the tax official responsible for the taxable B, the NKÚ found that according to the MIAS data, the German taxable C had delivered the Czech taxable goods (another machine) worth € 88,027 in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">The taxable person B declared that he had not received the goods, so the locally responsible Czech tax officer sent a request for information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">The answer was that the machine had been delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">In the course of further investigations into the taxable person B, the tax official found that the machine worth € 88,027 had not been booked with the taxable person B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German taxable person C in February 2005 to the Czech taxable person A.</seg>
<seg id="730">The NKÚ also found that the Czech tax officer responsible for taxpayer A had carried out an audit on the latter.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax official had the invoice from German taxpayer C dated February 7, 2005, in which taxpayer A is to be specified as the recipient of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax officer found that the taxable person A had not booked this invoice.</seg>
<seg id="733">Taxable A had entered into a lease with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also took care of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the response to the request for information to determine the tax liability of taxable person A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH found that the German taxable person C had not delivered the machine with a value of € 88,027 to the Czech Republic but to another German taxable person D.</seg>
<seg id="737">Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but delivery subject to tax within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">As a result, the German tax official did not recognize the German taxpayer C's right to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German taxable D delivered the machine to the Czech taxable B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to sales tax in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">The BRH also found that the German taxable C had stated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 that it had delivered a machine worth € 58,000 to the Czech taxable A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="743">The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">When examining the requests for information it received, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax authorities received a request for information from Germany on October 4, 2005, in which a German tax official requested the review of intra-Community deliveries by a German taxpayer to the value of € 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer .</seg>
<seg id="746">The German finance official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictional intra-Community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The German taxpayer has not been active in business since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="749">The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim by the German taxpayer against the German tax authorities, which the Czech taxpayer had made to the German FA as a shareholder in the German company.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information given to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official has so far no information that the German tax authorities are dealing with the case with regard to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="751">From the information available it follows that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored as an intra-community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to state the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see also section 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer delivered goods to a Czech taxpayer in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005 with a total value of € 33,205.</seg>
<seg id="754">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In response to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had shipped some of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the other goods had been collected personally by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="757">When asked by the local Czech tax officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a response to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="758">Nevertheless, the differences in the values ​​of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended that the Czech taxpayer carry out a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="759">This check has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer delivered goods to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004 worth € 46,854.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods for only € 14,856.</seg>
<seg id="762">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked to check the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="763">With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of € 31,999, i.e. an amount that corresponds to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="764">When asked by the locally responsible Czech tax officer, the NKÚ found that after receiving the answer from Germany, he contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and stayed with her so that after checking the invoices she and the company owner agreed to submit a supplementary one Wanted to talk about sales tax return for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">So far, no additional VAT return has been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retrospective VAT fixing for the relevant tax period were met.</seg>
<seg id="767">17th</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth € 11,600 to the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of the interstate exchange of information, the German tax official asked whether the Czech taxpayer mentioned actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer had founded a number of bogus companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech taxpayer submitted receipts for the sale in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech taxpayer was not registered as liable to VAT in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All of these facts indicated tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official provided this information in response to the request for information to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="775">When asked by the locally responsible Czech tax officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 based on a tax audit, including, among other things, declared the value of the goods which he had acquired from a German taxable person and at the same time asserted the right to deduct input tax for purchases from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">In his Czech sales tax return, he did not register sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="777">On the basis of a supplementary VAT return, which was submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official continued to fix the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="778">In this case, according to the Czech legal provisions, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States because the goods were not dispatched or transported to the Czech Republic from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="779">As a result, the Czech tax officer drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH found that immediately after receiving the response to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the German taxpayer's tax return and requested payment of sales tax worth € 1,600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the relevant FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of those goods was taxed properly.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been made:</seg>
<seg id="783">18th</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax officer received a request from the German tax authorities to find out whether the Czech taxpayer had bought a car worth € 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">A copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer was attached to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="786">A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was also included.</seg>
<seg id="787">In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and said that he had had no contact with a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="788">The sales tax registration certificate, the print of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="789">With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.</seg>
<seg id="790">After inquiring to the locally responsible Czech tax officer, the NKÚ determined that the Czech taxpayer was not based at the address given in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company was not available.</seg>
<seg id="791">Following a tax complaint procedure for the February 2005 taxation period, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer to zero.</seg>
<seg id="792">In a further investigation, the Czech finance officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who bought it on the basis of an internet advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="793">The BRH found that the locally responsible German tax officer had rejected the German taxpayer's claim to exemption from VAT for this delivery on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of € 3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the values ​​reported from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="795">A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods worth € 89,424 to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">As the purchase declared by the German taxpayer did not match the MIAS data, the German tax official asked for the exchange of information and the payment to be checked as part of the exchange of information between states.</seg>
<seg id="797">In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the only manager of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on July 8, 2005 and that a new manager had not yet been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech taxpayer made a sales tax return and a ZM, which had been signed by the unauthorized person, namely this company shareholder, after the managing director had been deleted from the commercial register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax official that the owner of the capital had paid the payment received in euros for the goods invoiced to the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Receipts have not been issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">When asked by the locally responsible Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax official had recognized the Czech taxpayer's right to VAT exemption for supplies of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005 .</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the German tax official had not corrected the German purchaser's VAT return, since a German court had meanwhile confirmed the German taxpayer's insolvency.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to raise a VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic in 2005 worth € 4,251,196, after having bought goods worth € 43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions either in his VAT return in 2004 or in that for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, he did not declare any output sales with a corresponding value.</seg>
<seg id="808">Because of these inconsistencies, the German FA requested information about the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods totaling CZK 167,246,083.</seg>
<seg id="810">The request for information was received on September 6, 2006, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this request for information, the Czech tax authorities stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company had no managing director (or other legal representative).</seg>
<seg id="812">It can be seen from the documents provided to the NKÚ by the responsible tax officer that a record of the start of the sales tax audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005 was drawn up on March 30, 2006 together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer .</seg>
<seg id="813">The taxpayer was also asked by the tax officer to provide all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the commercial register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on May 16, 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.</seg>
<seg id="815">The Czech taxpayer has not made any sales tax returns since April 2006.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the parallel investigation, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, examined several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany that were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two SAIs exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the responsible FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do taxable business in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Based on this information, the company was registered from June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) to manufacture wind turbines and deliver them to Austria in the name, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to insufficient own production capacities, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German taxpayer (UDE) based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of the wind turbines:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:</seg>
<seg id="824">- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its own risk and for its own account.</seg>
<seg id="825">Because of the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in their own name, at their own risk and for their own account, the place of delivery of the German subcontractor (UDE) is where the transport started, ie in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EU member state (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EU member state (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German subcontractor (UDE) because the EG -Member State for which the delivery was destined is different from the country of domicile of the Czech company19.</seg>
<seg id="828">Accordingly, this delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the input tax deduction in its VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.</seg>
<seg id="830">However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">- The wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic were delivered in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">- The delivery of the other wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) delivered both intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community deliveries from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its CM submitted to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">As a result, the Czech company may have treated all of its intra-Community supplies as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-community deliveries to Austria, but intra-community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">To ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined cases to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legal regulations in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the taxpayers and the FÄ to apply the new legal regulations:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In his ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable goods delivery with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 reported to a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-community deliveries to another German taxpayer in his CM with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.</seg>
<seg id="842">From the information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ, it was found that in both cases the electricity was supplied.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech taxpayers took the above deliveries into account in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004 applicable in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">During a further examination of these business transactions, an examination group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 different legal regulations regarding the supply or purchase of electrical energy applied between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic taxpayers supply electrical energy in accordance with the 2004 Law No. 235/2004 as deliveries of goods within the Community, according to the German legal provisions applicable in 2004, it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable sales in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The differences in the legal regulations were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of the law no. 635/2004, which changed some tax regulations with effect from January 1, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. During the examination of intra-community deliveries or purchases in cooperation with the BRH, it was further found that a Czech taxpayer in his CM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 intra-community deliveries to a German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech Taxpayer declared in his ZM for the same period intra-community deliveries to another German taxpayer worth CZK 263,470,776.</seg>
<seg id="848">Information submitted by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases it was a matter of delivering electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Law No. 235/2004, effective from January 1, 2005, the place of performance for the delivery of electrical energy is the place where the purchaser has his legal seat, his place of business or his permanent establishment for which this delivery is made.</seg>
<seg id="850">For this reason, the Czech taxpayers should not have specified the electricity deliveries in their ZM for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electrical energy in their CM as intra-community supplies resulted in a difference in amount of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="852">Final note</seg>
<seg id="853">The goals of the BRH and the NKÚ were achieved through the cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both audit offices gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The collaboration revealed differences in the two systems and in the statutory provisions relevant to sales tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions were discovered.</seg>
<seg id="857">For some of them, further observation is worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit results, both auditors developed recommendations for managing sales tax.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up to these recommendations in the form of a control audit should be part of the further observation.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both auditors form the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the area of ​​sales tax administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report by the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The awarding of services by public authorities is of great importance for both the state and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state's task is to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of creating a single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to be able to guarantee largely unrestricted competition even across borders, the contracting authorities must follow EU guidelines when awarding certain value limits (threshold values).</seg>
<seg id="8">For this purpose, the EU member states have to translate and apply the EU public procurement law into national law.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Below the EU thresholds, it is up to the individual countries to regulate the awarding of public contracts themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because of the fundamentally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and inadmissible benefits when awarding their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits both for the award of construction work throughout the EU and for the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="14">The focus of the audits was the application of the EU public procurement law, which was implemented in national regulations, and the prevention of corruption when awarding construction services in building construction, road construction or transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">Awards below the EU thresholds were also taken into account with a view to preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit results of both SAIs are summarized in this joint report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report is also intended for international institutions such as B. to the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="18">Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits, which he carried out in 2011/2012 at the building authorities responsible for the road construction and building construction of the federal government in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">He checked z. B. the construction of highways and large building projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the Federal Audit Office used results from previous investigations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction work in road construction, railroad construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other other construction areas in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the federal government's building authorities predominantly award public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the state building administration is responsible for the award of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In building construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those who use state budget funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">Freelancers are also involved in sub-areas of the procurement process in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="26">When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="27">Development of public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures restricted to the national area are regulated by budget law and the administrative regulations based on it.</seg>
<seg id="30">For both EU-wide and national contracts, many additional individual regulations are specified by internal administrative provisions,</seg>
<seg id="31">such as the so-called "procurement handbooks" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in compliance with the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other statutory provisions that apply both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">Public procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new regulation increased transparency in the use of public funds, enabled more competition and limited the possibility of corruption in the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fundamentals of public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure are to be used in particular for EU-wide awards.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold must use the national types of award (public tender, restricted tender, direct award), which largely correspond to the EU-wide types of award mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement law in Germany is characterized by the principle of the priority of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public tender (for national contracts).</seg>
<seg id="39">Any interested company can submit an offer for the open procedure and the public tender.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">The main purpose here is to divide an overall construction project into specialist and partial lots.</seg>
<seg id="42">The individual awarding of these lots should enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are over 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures also apply to construction projects below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">The simplified procedure is an exception to this, in which a less strict procedure may be used below the threshold values ​​and under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with EU law, Czech public procurement law contains provisions that contracts should be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favorable price is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic give contracting authorities the choice between open and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including around 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Construction volume of contracting authorities and proportions of types of award in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">The total construction volume in Germany in 2011 was EUR 307 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of this, EUR 45.5 billion was attributable to public construction (15%), which in addition to the federal building also includes the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The federal building volume in building construction and trunk road construction (excluding railroad construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="54">The volume of orders for construction work in building construction and trunk road construction by the federal government in 2011 was distributed as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% restricted and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiated procedures and Direct awards.</seg>
<seg id="55">Of these, 33.2% were awarded across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public works in the Czech Republic in 2011 was 4.7 billion euros, which was about 25% of the total volume of all works in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009 the volume was EUR 7.8 billion, which corresponded to 37% of the total construction volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for order volumes below the threshold 2.7% other procedures</seg>
<seg id="59">The data refer to all public contracts for deliveries, services and works that were awarded in 2011 by public procurement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="60">The above Data show that the parallel audits of both countries are aimed at a significant proportion of public procurement, that the prevention of corruption that has to be observed for all procurement is of great financial importance and that the open procedure and the public tender are of great importance when awarding contracts</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the results of the parallel tests</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries for the EU-wide award of construction works and for the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="63">In this context, the working groups of both audit offices compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">They essentially found:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU guidelines for the awarding of works by public authorities have been implemented in national law in the Czech Republic as well as in Germany (Nos. 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the EU requirements, the prevention regulations for corruption also serve the two countries' procurement regulations, some of which differ in terms of their focus and level of detail (No. 3.2).</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, an essential requirement for the tender documents is that they must contain all the information required for the correct preparation of the offer.</seg>
<seg id="68">The service descriptions must be neutral and must not have any restrictions restricting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Germany, the tender documents largely met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the object of the order adequately.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, construction work should be divided into lots where possible in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">In its tests, particularly in the area of ​​road construction, the NKÚ found that the awarding of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots could impair competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Narrowing the market potential can result in significant cost increases and pose the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">According to the provisions of both countries, the awarding authorities can, under certain conditions, in principle agree additional or modified services with the companies already commissioned, which prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, contracting entities can choose between open and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary anchored priority of the open procedure for EU-wide awards or the public tender applies, which corresponds to the open procedure for national awards.</seg>
<seg id="79">This allows more companies to submit offers.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price fixing between bidders and leads to the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values ​​reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded the construction work across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis when choosing the right type of award.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, cost databases are used to determine the costs of public buildings, especially in building construction,</seg>
<seg id="84">which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="85">A database is used in the road construction sector in the Czech Republic, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">Preliminary information and notices must be published for construction work to be awarded across Europe. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to adjust to the intended awards at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="87">The audited building authorities generally adhered to this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect use or a lack of controls may have an impact on competition (No. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of applicants for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">According to EU law, the number of invited applicants must be high enough to guarantee real competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries should change the selection of applicants as often as possible among the companies to be invited.</seg>
<seg id="93">In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed guidelines in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="94">The audited administrations did not take these requirements into account in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, the decisions regarding the selection of applicants were not always understandable (No. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, in the interests of fair competition, it must be ensured during the bidding phase that the companies interested in submitting a bid receive the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">Contact between these companies and each other and with freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description should be avoided as far as possible to avoid anti-competitive agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">Some of the audited building authorities in Germany did not meet these requirements (No. 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">When opening offers in both countries, the principle of multiple eyes and the principle of transparency must be observed.</seg>
<seg id="101">The requirements for the labeling, documentation, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers are intended to restrict the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tests in both countries showed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by requirements for the structure and process organization.</seg>
<seg id="104">The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been observed consistently by the auditing authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting authorities handed over offers to third parties for review without first reviewing the offers and adequately documenting abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="106">As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">At the conclusion of the EU-wide tendering process, the companies participating in the competition should be informed of the intended contract before the contract is awarded.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection option also has a preventive function against corruptive behavior.</seg>
<seg id="109">The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review options for non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to meet the specified deadlines when placing orders, or the content differed from the bidder's offer (No. 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited building authorities in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not adequately implemented in the award notes of some procedures.</seg>
<seg id="113">Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the anti-corruption function of the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">The contracting authorities of both countries largely fulfilled their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Fundamentals of EU procurement law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="116">EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to guarantee unrestricted competition in the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union the procurement coordination as well as the remedies directive, which the member states had to transpose into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination, and the principle of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">In order to achieve these goals, the procurement coordination guidelines contain special regulations for EU-wide construction work for construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="120">To this end, their expected order amounts must currently reach or exceed 5,000,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="121">The regulations concern in particular the content of the tender documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, compliance with deadlines, etc. for the receipt of the offers, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of the applicants and the legal remedies directive forms the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of possible violations of public procurement law, the companies concerned can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have implemented the European Union directives into national law.</seg>
<seg id="124">Corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="125">Importance of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="126">There is no legal definition of the concept of corruption in either country.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is the misuse of a trust relationship for private gain,</seg>
<seg id="128">the usually is initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and result in significant economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="130">The global cost of corruption is estimated to be 5% of global economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the area of ​​the European Union, the scope of these costs is estimated at 1%.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair behavior can jeopardize trust in the integrity and functionality of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">In doing so, they have to check the structure and process organization of their administrations for areas that are particularly susceptible to corruption in order to take appropriate security measures against corruption.</seg>
<seg id="135">Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the susceptibility of decision-making processes to corruptive abuse.</seg>
<seg id="136">The awarding of public works is generally seen as a work area that is particularly susceptible to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Corruption prevention measures</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption - especially bribery and bribery as well as acceptance and approval of benefits - is subject to criminal and labor law.</seg>
<seg id="139">To prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued guidelines and recommendations for preventing corruption in the Federal Administration. According to this, in addition to risk analysis, the following principles in particular must be observed for the procurement area: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multiple-eyes principle and transparency, basic separation of planning, awarding and billing, precise and complete documentation of the awarding procedures.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, other anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the procurement regulations.</seg>
<seg id="141">For example, the responsible federal ministry for awarding federal trunk roads introduced an electronically supported control system in 2011,</seg>
<seg id="142">with the allocation data - such as B. the estimated costs and the order amounts - as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected across the board and evaluated for any abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="143">Corruption is also subject to criminal and labor law in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="144">The statutory requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders as well as the ban on all forms of discrimination form the most important basis for the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper to combat corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of the measures recommended therein have already been implemented in national procurement law and corresponding administrative regulations14.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation essentially contains the following regulations: lowering the threshold values ​​for smaller orders, the contracting authority has to notify the contracting authorities beforehand, including the reasons for the invitation to tender, the ban on restricting the number of bidders in restricted procedures and thus eliminating the possibility to select bidders Lottery procedure, introduction of the obligation to publish the order documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Test results for the individual phases of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Procurement documents The procurement documents must contain all the information that the bidders need for a proper bid preparation.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the tender documents must enable an accurate calculation.</seg>
<seg id="152">The bidders must not be assigned any risks that they cannot calculate.</seg>
<seg id="153">The tender documents consist in particular of the service description and the contractual terms.</seg>
<seg id="154">In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.</seg>
<seg id="155">EU law and anti-corruption requirements</seg>
<seg id="156">The requirements of EU law on the procurement documents are directed in particular at the technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="157">These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="158">The service description must always be product-neutral.</seg>
<seg id="159">For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.</seg>
<seg id="160">Avoiding competition-restricting requirements in the tender documents is also a fundamental principle of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the tender documents should be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation when creating the offers and for manipulation when evaluating them.</seg>
<seg id="162">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="163">Same or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications have been implemented in national law.</seg>
<seg id="164">The services are generally to be advertised in a product-neutral manner without specifications.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the service descriptions, the individual services must generally be broken down in detail into service units with the respective quantities.</seg>
<seg id="166">The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. euros per m² or per piece).</seg>
<seg id="167">Services can only be defined by functional targets in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="168">The service descriptions must in any case be complete and unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="169">They have to contain exact quantities and may not include services for which it is not certain whether they are needed.</seg>
<seg id="170">Payments based on lump sums or time expenditure should be avoided if possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite requirements in the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The call for tenders should only be made known when the tender documents have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Regulations that differ from each other</seg>
<seg id="175">There is no obligation to tender construction works in lots in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="176">If it is possible according to the type of service to be contracted, the public contracting authorities can divide construction services into several lots.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, construction work must be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and / or by type or subject (specialist lots).</seg>
<seg id="178">This should enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price agreements more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is generally considered the most economical.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be specified in both the EU-wide and the national procedures in the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should make it completely and finally clear to the applicants according to which criteria their offers should be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the specification of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the tender documents, is only required for EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="183">In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria are only to be recorded in an administrative award note.</seg>
<seg id="184">Procurement documents drawn up by contracted freelancers in Germany must not contain any references to these offices or the planners or experts involved in the building construction and some road construction administrations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other inadmissible competitive advantages without knowing the client about contacting these freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why freelancers may neither send tender documents nor display planning documents for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contact person for the company is the client alone.</seg>
<seg id="188">There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additional or changed services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) are almost always required for large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="190">To a certain extent, the legal provisions in both countries allow supplements to be given to the company that has already been commissioned without having to carry out an award procedure with public announcement.</seg>
<seg id="191">According to EU regulations and German regulations, the remuneration for supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic there is a narrower limit of 20% for a corresponding award without public announcement.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, this may increase the risk of a delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.</seg>
<seg id="195">If supplementary services are also transferred to the company already commissioned, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is fundamentally not possible according to the regulations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="196">When determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed must rather be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to supplementary benefits, the scope of benefits may also be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be offset against additional supplements.</seg>
<seg id="199">Essential test results</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">Some performance descriptions also contained product-related requirements - for example for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was considered.</seg>
<seg id="205">Service specifications broken down into partial services</seg>
<seg id="206">The BRH has not found any violations of the requirement in any of the audited procedures to generally advertise services in a list of services broken down into partial services.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="208">In the majority of the procedures, the tender documents were completed before the start of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="209">In some procedures, the tender documents had to be corrected during the offer phase, as positions or deadlines had changed in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="210">Occasionally, the specifications contained items where it was not clear whether they were needed.</seg>
<seg id="211">Almost half of a bill of quantities for demolition work consisted of such demand items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Lots and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">For many contracts, there was no prescribed reason why the services, which were mainly advertised according to the unskilled, were not further divided into partial lots.</seg>
<seg id="214">There were no complaints regarding the criteria that should be used as a basis for the evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="215">References to freelancers</seg>
<seg id="216">A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.</seg>
<seg id="217">Some of their names were on the cover pages or in attached plans or reports.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked applicants to contact the architect “on questions relating to the tender”.</seg>
<seg id="219">In the building construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints shown mainly to the omissions of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the service specifications.</seg>
<seg id="220">The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="221">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender For the public contract for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.</seg>
<seg id="223">The awarding authority did not allow the use of comparable products without giving reasons.</seg>
<seg id="224">When several university buildings were erected, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="225">Service descriptions with service units</seg>
<seg id="226">In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="227">As performance units, it only stated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="229">When building a bypass, the specifications were changed four times as part of a restricted procedure between August and September 2009,</seg>
<seg id="230">since the scope of services had increased significantly and the technical requirements had changed.</seg>
<seg id="231">Tender documents for social buildings included inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary construction studies and incomplete construction drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="232">When building a large library building, the specifications for the interior did not contain any requirements regarding product quality.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lots and eligibility criteria</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, the division of construction work into partial lots or the award of partial orders is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="236">An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a freeway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded in batches, savings of up to EUR 31.6 million at a total cost of EUR 620.3 million would have been possible.</seg>
<seg id="237">In the case of six different structures alone, which were the subject of a single order, a lottery contract could have saved 2.5 million euros (25%).</seg>
<seg id="238">If the construction of 20 bridges were awarded in batches, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total award.</seg>
<seg id="239">When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.</seg>
<seg id="240">When building part of a motorway, the contracting authority asked the bidders in an open procedure, among other things. proof of at least three road construction projects carried out, each worth EUR 28 million, from the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public award of another section of a motorway comprised six separate construction projects in which the awarding authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million in the past three years as a suitability criterion for the companies.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) came from orders from a total of five companies that carried out the orders alone or as a joint venture.</seg>
<seg id="244">In 46 award procedures with an order volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even only one bidder submitted an offer.</seg>
<seg id="245">The NKÚ showed that narrowing the market potential could result in significant cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Additional services</seg>
<seg id="247">When building a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not use any of the procedures prescribed by law when awarding additional services in two cases and also did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.</seg>
<seg id="248">Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, supplements arose in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case up to EUR 165.4 million (net), which means that the respective order volume increased by 21% and 91 respectively % increased.</seg>
<seg id="249">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="250">In the case of several university buildings, some of the services were not listed in the tender documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="251">Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit set in national procurement law of 20% of the original contract value, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without a contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="252">When building a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiated procedures without a tender.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction period, the contracting authority expanded the scope of the work by EUR 2 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">Based on a sample inspection of construction projects, the NKÚ determined that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometer in the Czech Republic was up to EUR 14.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">In contrast, according to an analysis of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Building, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometer in Germany is up to EUR 10.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="260">The basic regulations on the tender documents largely agree in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="261">They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">For example, the requirement for the adequacy of the service descriptions should enable bidders to correctly calculate and prepare their offers,</seg>
<seg id="263">Protect the client from additional services to be agreed retrospectively and also limit the scope for speculation.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the common basic requirements for the procurement documents are supplemented by regulations which are intended to further reduce restrictions on competition and manipulation options.</seg>
<seg id="265">In the Czech Republic, there are no such requirements, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for the non-EU-wide award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="266">The requirements for the specification of services have largely been met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which could also have restricted competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The existing requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.</seg>
<seg id="269">In the Czech Republic, according to the NKÚ's findings, the awarding of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can result in restrictions in the field of providers to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="270">The extensive reference requirements stipulated in road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized companies are not allowed to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="271">A limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">When awarding and remunerating additional or changed services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to the EU guidelines and the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without award procedure with public announcement.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor without notice in the negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often crossed</seg>
<seg id="277">because the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with a public announcement.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting negative consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determine the type of award and take into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of award, the client determines the scope of the number of companies participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">He can leave the circle of possible applicants and bidders largely unlimited, for example by choosing an open procedure, or limit it by specifying non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="283">Europe-wide procurement procedures must be used for construction projects where a threshold value set by the EU is reached or exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="284">EU law and anti-corruption requirements</seg>
<seg id="285">When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take particular account of the European law bids on competition and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total contract value of the construction work for a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction work is to be awarded across Europe according to open or restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="288">The contracting authority can deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide award for construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold and award construction services in national award procedures, provided the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the total this lot does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="289">A unified building project must not be divided into individual measures without a compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low a cost in order to avoid the obligation to award construction services across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="290">Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="291">The detailed justification for the selected award type and the examination of the obligation to apply the EU award regulations are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully implemented the EU legal requirements for award procedures and the threshold in national law.</seg>
<seg id="295">Regulations that differ from each other</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has also transferred the principle of equality between open and restricted procedures contained in the EU Directive to its building contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="297">There is freedom of choice between the open and the restricted procedure without the decision having to be documented or justified. However, other methods are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - for national contracts - the public tender generally have priority. This is defined by budget and public procurement law as well as the guidelines for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of award - such as the restricted procedure or restricted invitation to tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in public procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">The existence of an exceptional case must be clearly justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure as unrestricted competition as possible, to exclude manipulation options by specifying certain bidders and to make possible price agreements between bidders more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="302">The principle of the public tender is a central element of corruption prevention in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis when choosing the right type of award.</seg>
<seg id="304">The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases from public administrations and other organizations to determine the likely costs in the field of public building construction.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases include Cost parameters for building categories, usage units, building elements or individual building services.</seg>
<seg id="306">The expected order value of a planned project or a construction work to be awarded can be determined on the basis of such cost parameters.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few building authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="308">A nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot use central databases or the average price of comparable construction measures to determine the expected costs of construction work.</seg>
<seg id="310">In most cases, the cost calculations are based on estimates by the financing agency or are based on the amount of the funds made available to the construction agency.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures to standardize costing procedures are still in their infancy.</seg>
<seg id="312">As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011 - 2012, the responsible ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardized building materials and substances.</seg>
<seg id="313">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="314">In this database, information on the cost of materials and on construction and finishing works as well as other cost-relevant data is to be recorded in order to enable cost determination and determination of unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Czech Ministry of Transport has also released a data collection for construction projects for better cost control,</seg>
<seg id="316">which is to serve as a benchmark for pricing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="317">BRH main test results</seg>
<seg id="318">Choice of award procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities largely tendered the construction work in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus followed the budgetary and procurement law requirements.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the federal government's construction work was tendered publicly or using the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction this share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">When choosing non-public award types, detailed reasons were sometimes lacking as to why the awarding bodies had to deviate from the principle of the open procedure or the public tender.</seg>
<seg id="323">In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH determined on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures that the non-public procurement types have significant disadvantages compared to the open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many as for direct tenders.</seg>
<seg id="325">The investigation also found that the bid prices for restricted tenders and over-the-counter contracts were 6% and 10% higher on average than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Building and a state audit office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public award types.</seg>
<seg id="327">As a result of its economic efficiency studies, the Federal Ministry of Building even found that the differences between public and non-public procurement procedures were twice as high.</seg>
<seg id="328">Taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="329">As a rule, the audited contracting authorities drew up procurement plans for the construction projects for which they had calculated an expected total contract value of more than 5,000,000 euros, in which they defined the construction work to be awarded according to EU-wide and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the award plans, a share of more than 80% of the construction work was always to be awarded across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">A circumvention of the obligation to EU-wide procurement by underestimated cost estimates could not be determined.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in part as a result of incorrect calculations, the fact that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures fell below the minimum.</seg>
<seg id="333">During the construction phase, some contracting entities improperly changed the specifications of their award plans.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures was still adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="335">For most of the construction measures examined, the proportion of EU-wide contracts was mostly lower according to the billing results than provided for in the contract.</seg>
<seg id="336">In some cases, the contracting authorities violated the requirement to tender every 1,000,000 euros and more in individual EU-wide procedures for construction projects above the EU threshold,</seg>
<seg id="337">and chose national procedures instead.</seg>
<seg id="338">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of type of award</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects as part of a major sporting event and residential construction projects, the contracting authorities divided the construction work into several sub-orders, even though these services were of the same or comparable type.</seg>
<seg id="341">As a result of these breakdowns, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were then awarded using simplified procedures or even disregarding legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="342">Calculation methods for the estimated order value</seg>
<seg id="343">In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were an insufficient tool to determine the expected order values.</seg>
<seg id="344">The data was based on recently completed construction projects, but there were indications of a lack of efficiency, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits from the contracted companies.</seg>
<seg id="345">For three sections of a freeway ring road, the actual prices were around 37% below the expected order values ​​determined using the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport has since revised the databases in order to take into account not only the offer prices of the past few years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="347">In building construction, the expected contract values ​​are based on the project architects 'estimated cost values ​​or on investors' estimates.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual order values ​​differed greatly from the estimated values.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later, but eight supplements in the course of the construction work resulted in a cost increase of EUR 2.1 million or 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, the actual order value for building a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, which also resulted in cost increases during the construction phase.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the bid prices exceeded the estimates and increased during construction.</seg>
<seg id="352">When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. When building a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately by 139% because the usable space had only increased by 12%.</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented the EU regulations for determining the type of award and for taking the EU threshold into account in national law. Therefore, the respective regulations largely correspond.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender applicable in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations applicable in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in the competition in public procedures or public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="357">The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="358">The risk of corruption is significantly improved in that the applicant field is not restricted by the client's manipulation-prone specifications and price collusion between bidders is made more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="359">The investigations confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="360">According to Czech law, contracting entities can award contracts in open or restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="361">According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders in procedures with previous participation competition can no longer be restricted.</seg>
<seg id="362">The restricted procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authorities largely followed the requirements regarding the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services were divided inadmissibly in order to avoid the requirements for choosing the type of award.</seg>
<seg id="364">When taking the EU threshold into account, errors had to be found in Germany that resulted in the minimum proportion of services advertised across the EU being below the minimum.</seg>
<seg id="365">There is still no satisfactory solution in the Czech Republic to correctly estimate the likely costs of construction works and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">The building authorities should, if necessary, ensure that the requirements for the selection of the type of award and the scope of services to be advertised across the EU are complied with by means of further checks, or that the requirements for appropriate cost calculations are met.</seg>
<seg id="367">Prior information and announcement</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of construction projects with construction work to be awarded across Europe, the public developer must inform interested companies in advance of the tender about the intended contracts.</seg>

<seg id="370">EU law and anti-corruption requirements</seg>
<seg id="371">The preliminary information should contain the essential procurement law information for the planned construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">They are required for those construction projects for which the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold value and for which the client wants to shorten the offer periods for open or restricted procedures.</seg>

<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published for construction work that is not to be awarded across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="385">Procurement procedures may be started no earlier than one month after the prior information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the National Official Journal (for all awards).</seg>
<seg id="386">Only in exceptional cases can prior information not be published.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, no prior information is required for the non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and participation competitions before restricted tenders must be published on the federal internet portal and, if necessary, also in newspapers or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted tenders without a competition, notices of services to be awarded are required from 25,000 euros (ex-ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">All planned lots of construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.</seg>
<seg id="391">In Germany, this is particularly important because of the small-scale nature of the construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="392">In the Czech Republic, this regulation has only a minor impact, since there are far fewer construction works being divided into lots.</seg>
<seg id="393">Essential test results</seg>

<seg id="395">Preliminary information</seg>
<seg id="396">The examined contracting authorities published preliminary information for all audited construction projects with construction work to be awarded across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open procedures, however, they shortened the offer deadlines, although the 52-day period between sending the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the twelve months of prior information had already expired and before it was extended.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many published preliminary information, references to the planned division of construction work into lots were missing.</seg>
<seg id="400">Notices</seg>
<seg id="401">In some cases, the audits of the audited bodies contained CPV codes that differed from the information in the preliminary information or that did not correctly record the services required.</seg>

<seg id="405">The latter published the reports on its own fee-based procurement platform.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the awarding authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the reports to the federal government's free internet portal as prescribed.</seg>

<seg id="414">The awarding agency came to the conclusion that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicant with the worst ratings from the further procedure.</seg>

<seg id="417">The contracting authority did not publish the tender when the former military site was renovated.</seg>
<seg id="418">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-level information system with prior information and announcement is an important component in order to implement the transparency requirement for Europe-wide awards, to strengthen competition and thus also to prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures also in the national procurement area:</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of applicants for non-public award types</seg>
<seg id="422">In contrast to public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be contracted can take part in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="423">In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a selection in advance which companies should be asked to submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU regulations allow the number of applicants to be restricted in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="425">In the case of restricted procedures, however, at least five companies must be invited to submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="426">At least three companies must be invited to negotiate procedures with contract award notices.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of invited applicants must be high enough to guarantee a real competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of companies to be invited is a process within the procurement process that is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. B. certain companies can be favored unilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="430">In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favors possible agreements between applicants.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both cases, the award result can be significantly affected at the expense of the client.</seg>
<seg id="432">The awarding authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="435">The rules for selecting applicants are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding bodies should change as often as possible among the companies to be selected when selecting applicants.</seg>
<seg id="437">The competition must not be restricted to companies that are located in certain regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The awarding agencies must justify the selection of applicants and document the course of the selection process in their award notes.</seg>
<seg id="439">Regulations that differ from each other</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three applicants must be invited to submit tenders for restricted tenders, and several suitable applicants for direct award contracts.</seg>
<seg id="441">With the exception of two special areas, the new Czech regulations make it inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in restricted and negotiated procedures.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the multiple eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.</seg>
<seg id="443">Has z. For example, if an employee suggests a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction department or a representative from the contracting authority must usually change this proposal, for example by removing a proposed company and / or adding a new company.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is to prevent a single person from finally being able to determine the group of companies to be involved in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could enable far-reaching agreements between the parties involved.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of companies to be requested is to be treated confidentially - also vis-à-vis freelancers - and is not to be made generally accessible.</seg>
<seg id="447">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations on the preparation and keeping secret of applicant lists.</seg>
<seg id="449">According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be invited, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is a loophole in the Czech legislation.</seg>
<seg id="451">Essential test results</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of applicants</seg>
<seg id="454">The requirement to request a minimum number of companies to submit tenders for non-public contracts was met with a few exceptions.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis by the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide tendering procedures for building services in building construction showed that the awarding authorities requested an average of 6.6 companies to submit tenders for federal government restricted tenders and an average of 4.4 companies for direct tenders.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of company and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">In the case of trades with only a few providers, the awarding agencies did not always change the group of selected applicants.</seg>
<seg id="458">Above all, they considered companies that were already known to them and that they had proven themselves.</seg>
<seg id="459">As a reason for this, they stated that in the case of non-public proceedings, the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete had to be ensured before the invitation to submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="460">The BRH did not find an impermissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regional companies than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="461">The awarding authorities attributed this primarily to the fact that the scope of services for the non-public procurement procedures was significantly lower on average and therefore z. B. longer journeys are more important than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Multi-eyes principle and suggestions for freelancers</seg>
<seg id="463">Contrary to the regulations, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be asked to be amended by an independent person.</seg>
<seg id="464">They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacity, tight deadlines or inadequate knowledge of alternative suitable companies.</seg>
<seg id="465">Often it was also not documented who proposed the companies that were invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="466">A few random samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the lists of applicants and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="467">As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent possible against possible manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidential treatment of the bidder lists</seg>
<seg id="469">In the case of a contracting authority, the lists of the companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this department.</seg>
<seg id="470">In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or approved companies would have been passed on without authorization and e.g. B. agreements between these companies.</seg>
<seg id="471">documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">Only in a few cases did the documentation of the procurement procedures contain reasons for the selection of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="473">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection of applicants</seg>
<seg id="475">When building a motorway ring, the bidders received no information about the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="476">With regard to the restricted procedures for the expansion and modernization of the waterways and ports, the announcements contained no information on how the selection of applicants should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="477">In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, which exceeded the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="478">The procurement committee then carried out a lottery for the selection of the companies.</seg>
<seg id="479">This procedure, which was fundamentally admissible at the time, should however have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="481">Because of the high risk of manipulation when selecting applicants in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent unlawful restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">With the multiple-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidder lists and the sole authority of the awarding authority to propose the companies to be requested, the German regulations limit such possibilities of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="483">With the Czech regulations, the newly introduced stipulation of the largely unlimited number of bidders in the case of non-public procedures can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the examination findings showed that some of these requirements were only insufficiently implemented and the manipulation potential for improperly restricting the field of participants was not sufficiently reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">The contracting authorities should completely remedy the deficits shown.</seg>
<seg id="486">Offer phase</seg>
<seg id="487">With the announcement of the award or with the invitation to submit an offer, the offer phase begins, in which the companies can create offers on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.</seg>
<seg id="488">Applicants can submit their offers up to the expiry of the offer period set by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="489">EU law and anti-corruption requirements</seg>
<seg id="490">There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The awarding authorities have to observe the national regulations with which the manipulation possibilities existing during the offer phase are to be counteracted.</seg>
<seg id="492">Above all, these are organizational requirements and controls.</seg>
<seg id="493">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="495">The procurement documents, on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their offers, are generally only to be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Freelancers involved in the procurement procedure may not perform this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information even during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">If there is anything unclear about the tender documents or other questions about the tender, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="499">Freelancers commissioned to prepare the procurement documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the entire offer phase, contact between the contracted freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="501">Freelancers must not become a hub in the procurement process, through which contacts can be established with anti-competitive effects.</seg>
<seg id="502">Offers sent by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Offers transmitted electronically must have technical encryption.</seg>
<seg id="504">Regulations that differ from each other</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies to print and send the tender documents, whose employees are required to keep the offers confidential and to ensure that the contractual obligations are met with due diligence.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, the offers received must be marked with an entry stamp and sent immediately, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This member of staff may not be involved in the award.</seg>
<seg id="508">The offers received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The awarding authority records the offer data including order numbers as well as the creation and receipt details in a protocol.</seg>

<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">The examinations for the offer phase focused primarily on the award procedures of a building administration.</seg>
<seg id="515">Dispatch of the tender documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The contracting authorities of the audited building administration either sent the tender documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.</seg>
<seg id="517">Freelancers did not send any procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to applicants</seg>
<seg id="519">The audited building administration mostly did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding when naming the contact person for questions and information.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting authority in the service descriptions, but from the project management as contact persons.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some tender documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had drawn up the service specifications.</seg>
<seg id="522">When inquiring during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="523">Identification of the offers</seg>
<seg id="524">In the audited building administration, all offers received were stamped and stamped.</seg>
<seg id="525">For some freelance contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Keep the offers</seg>
<seg id="527">After being marked, not all offers were immediately and immediately sent to the employee responsible for custody, who locked the offers in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">In the meantime, the offers in a construction office were stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which every employee had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another agency had hung a mailbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which the offers thrown in there sometimes even stayed overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">Since the slot in this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only employees but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to remove offers received and, if necessary, manipulate them.</seg>
<seg id="531">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="532">No defects were criticized on the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="534">During the bidding phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the award procedure should be prevented in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="535">By ensuring that all bidders receive the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.</seg>
<seg id="536">The regulations regarding the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers appear suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more extensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The results of the investigation in Germany have shown violations of the regulations in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.</seg>

<seg id="544">EU law and anti-corruption requirements</seg>
<seg id="545">There are no separate EU legal regulations for opening the offers.</seg>
<seg id="546">For this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure, however, the national regulations on preventing corruption contain extensive guidelines for protecting offers and competition.</seg>

<seg id="552">In most award procedures, bidders can take part in the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="553">Only offers that were available to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are allowed to open.</seg>
<seg id="554">Offers received late may in principle no longer be considered.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the bid prices are to be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="556">The minutes are read out and signed by the negotiator.</seg>

<seg id="561">The committee can also be tasked with other phases of the award procedure, such as: B. with the evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary open the offer.</seg>
<seg id="563">The negotiator must be an employee of the tendering agency.</seg>
<seg id="564">The negotiator and, in the case of building contract awards, the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the tender documents or in the awarding and contract processing.</seg>
<seg id="565">In addition to the offer prices, the minutes of the opening date must also include information about discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or late offers.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signing authority of the applicant are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="567">The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be labeled in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.</seg>
<seg id="568">The offers are usually marked with perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made accessible to those directly responsible for processing.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are no corresponding Czech regulations.</seg>
<seg id="570">If only one tender is received in a tendering procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must be returned unevaluated.</seg>

<seg id="587">When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the registrar only one month after the offer deadline. The registrar nevertheless accepted this offer.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="589">The regulations of both countries regarding the opening of offers are largely the same. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation when opening the offers can be significantly limited.</seg>
<seg id="590">The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the process as well as for the labeling, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers restrict manipulation options such as: B. subsequent changes to the offers.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, those responsible for opening the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The overall few complaints prove the high level of acceptance of the requirements for opening the offer.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of the offers</seg>
<seg id="595">Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="596">He has to determine the offer for the award of the contract that best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="597">EU law and anti-corruption requirements</seg>
<seg id="598">The EU requirements provide for a multi-stage process:</seg>
<seg id="599">The suitability of the bidders must first be determined.</seg>
<seg id="600">Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="601">Companies are to be excluded from participation in the procurement procedure, which z. B. are legally convicted of bribery or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="602">The offers of the non-excluded bidders are to be checked mathematically, technically and economically and to be evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. The client has to examine offers with unusually low prices in particular.</seg>
<seg id="604">The examination and evaluation of the offers is a particularly manipulation-prone phase of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The preference or disadvantage of bidders can impermissibly affect the result of the evaluation and thus prevent the most economically advantageous offer from being determined.</seg>
<seg id="607">The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the examination and assessment meet the requirements for integrity and specialist knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="608">It also has to ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions made.</seg>
<seg id="609">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar regulations</seg>

<seg id="612">The requirements for the proof of suitability to be submitted by the companies as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are specified in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">After checking the suitability of the bidder, the suitability criteria may no longer be used when evaluating the offers.</seg>
<seg id="614">The rating must be limited to the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The submitted offers must first be formally checked immediately to see whether they are complete and whether they contain e.g. B. abnormalities are included which could indicate possible intent to manipulate.</seg>
<seg id="616">If bidders are excluded from further review and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the evaluation of the offers results in an inappropriately low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.</seg>
<seg id="618">The decisions made when reviewing and evaluating the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="619">Regulations that differ from each other</seg>

<seg id="621">Only the awarding authority may review the offers and carry out a mathematical check of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="622">It only has to employ staff who are not concerned with the award decision or the implementation of the measure.</seg>
<seg id="623">The perception of the other examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="624">If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers as confidential.</seg>
<seg id="625">You may only make suggestions for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the offers.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees prepare evaluation reports with award proposals.</seg>
<seg id="628">Ultimately - as in Germany - only the awarding agencies have to decide on the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="629">If the supporting documents or declarations required to submit an offer are only incomplete in Germany, the awarding authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline has passed, can the offer be excluded from the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a bidder fails to do this, he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.</seg>
<seg id="634">If the price structure of the offer indicates that prices for partial services are set too low or too high, the bidder must be requested to clear up these ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id="635">If he does not succeed and the contracting authority can provide evidence of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant quantity changes in partial services when calculating their offer, which can result in significant cost increases for the construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.</seg>
<seg id="638">A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, surcharges cannot be awarded for offers with inappropriately high or low prices.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more offers fall below the relevant price determination of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders have to prove the correct calculation of their offers.</seg>
<seg id="641">If this is not possible for them, the awarding authority can exclude the relevant offers.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the tender can be canceled after the economic viability test if only offers with unjustifiable low prices are available.</seg>
<seg id="643">In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge cannot be refused for offers with prices that are significantly higher than the client's calculation.</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is suspicion of restrictive behavior in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its specialist supervisory level.</seg>
<seg id="645">This has to decide which measures are to be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor should be informed.</seg>
<seg id="646">The specialist supervisory level must e.g. B. Agree even for construction work over 50,000 euros, if awarded on the open market, a contract is not awarded to the offer with the lowest price or the tender is to be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="647">There are no corresponding regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">Essential test results</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Suitability and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">The majority of the award procedures examined met the requirements listed.</seg>
<seg id="652">For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">A beneficiary commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being fully available.</seg>
<seg id="654">With some procedures it was not understandable whether the awarding authority considered all announced award criteria in its selection decision or whether it based its award decision only on the criterion “price”.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of the people involved and confidentiality of the offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities use unauthorized persons to check the offers.</seg>
<seg id="657">For example, freelance workers or those involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction authorities justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, the freelancers commissioned to review the offers also contributed employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfill their contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="660">For the construction services, it was usually also not understandable whether the offers made by freelancers were only accessible to those directly responsible for processing.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and arithmetical examination of the offers</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting authorities handed over the opened offers to freelancers for further examination without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the arithmetical examination themselves and documented their results.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being understandable for the awarding authorities.</seg>
<seg id="664">In the documents examined, abnormalities or missing price or product information were sometimes not or only insufficiently marked.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">In the case of a sample in a building construction administration, the cheapest offers in three quarters of the award procedures examined differed by more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">Every twentieth procurement procedure was canceled due to inappropriate bid prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">Not all bid reviews and clarification talks with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="669">More detailed information was often missing, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.</seg>
<seg id="670">Often the deviations were justified, e.g. B. by notices of changed market prices or increased material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction authorities explained that it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of a tender from a public law institution, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined estimated value of these services.</seg>
<seg id="673">Further calculation checks or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="674">In a clarification meeting, the awarding agency found no evidence of price dumping for the company that was then commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="675">This left it unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or the offer price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">The client later rated the contracted company as a "cheap company" that could neither keep quality nor deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another tender, a construction agency awarded an offer the price of which was 35% higher than the cost of the calculation.</seg>
<seg id="678">It did not cancel the tender and cited the non-factual reasoning that an adequate calculation could be concluded for this company.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">There were two irregularities in an audited building administration, both of which were reported to the technical supervisory level.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one of the cases, the bidding for two bidders was identical, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="682">When the other regulations were applied, the tests did not reveal any significant objections.</seg>
<seg id="683">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="684">Qualifying Examination</seg>
<seg id="685">In many of the audited construction projects, including In the case of university construction, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Scoring</seg>
<seg id="687">When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority disregarded the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the offers.</seg>
<seg id="688">In the case of a construction project to expand the rail network, the awarding authority only determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of road maintenance measures, the specified criterion "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in one procedure.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the reduction offered by the second and third position bidders was not sufficiently taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the selection of offers</seg>
<seg id="692">In three award procedures in the context of housing subsidies, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.</seg>
<seg id="693">When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.</seg>
<seg id="694">It was not possible to check this selection because the surveys were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="696">The regulations for the examination and evaluation of the offers correspond to the requirements of the EU in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="697">Regarding the details of the procedure and the selection of the people involved, the respective regulations differ.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, the process flow is regulated more strictly than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular on the implementation of the multiple-eyes principle and to protect the offers.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, it had to be ascertained in some of the award procedures that were examined that essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the offers were not or only insufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="701">Without comprehensibility and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions are favored.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly serious defect was the handover of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently looked through and documented the offers beforehand and thus protected them from possible manipulations in the further process.</seg>
<seg id="703">If contracting authorities have tasks in the examination and evaluation of the offers carried out by third parties, adequate precautions and an increased control effort are necessary to counter the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">When examining the appropriateness of the prices, the audited departments in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, complaints arose primarily in the aptitude test and in the application of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After the offers have been checked and evaluated, the award procedure is concluded by awarding the contract or by lifting the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">EU law and anti-corruption requirements</seg>
<seg id="709">In EU-wide award procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">The companies have the possibility to check the intended award within 10 days for information electronically or by fax or within 15 days for other means of communication and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="711">A contract may not be concluded before this information period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="712">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="713">If a bidder submits a review request within the information period, a contract can only be concluded after the final decision in the review process.</seg>
<seg id="714">Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.</seg>
<seg id="715">The review process is intended to ensure legal protection for the companies and to persuade the client to comply with public procurement law throughout the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="716">To do this, he must document the procedure sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="717">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented the EU regulations on information and review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="722">The client should place the order within the announced award period,</seg>
<seg id="723">also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="724">In the case of open and restricted procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="725">The losing bidders must be informed promptly of the decision to award the contract and of the reasons for not taking their bids into account.</seg>
<seg id="726">Procurement procedures may only be canceled under certain conditions, e.g. B. if the offer prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="727">Regulations that differ from each other</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, there is a 10- or 15-day obligation to provide information and to wait before the contract is awarded, even for construction work that is not to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, these requirements only apply to EU-wide contracts.</seg>
<seg id="730">For the other procedures in Germany, the tenderers can only be informed of the award decision after the contract has been awarded.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, an award procedure must be terminated if only one offer has been received or only one offer has been evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it meets the conditions of the tender and is economical.</seg>
<seg id="733">Essential test results</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">There were only a few complaints regarding the awarding of contracts when the award procedure was completed.</seg>
<seg id="736">In the case of EU-wide contracts, companies sometimes received order letters before the information deadlines expired, which could result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In individual cases, order letters also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer, such as: B. changed dates.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, the contracting authorities failed to meet the award deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="739">In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the second cheapest offer because a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to perform the services at the originally offered price after the expiry of the award period.</seg>
<seg id="740">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority differed in content from the bidder's offer.</seg>
<seg id="742">In the case of some contracts, such as road maintenance measures, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the statutory period.</seg>
<seg id="743">When awarding construction services for the renovation of former military premises, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after the statutory period had expired.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the EU requirements to complete the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of the unsuccessful applicants or bidders increases the tools for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to awards below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, deadlines for placing orders were exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">Building administrations should avoid the shortcomings highlighted when completing their procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The award procedures are to be documented comprehensibly during their individual stages with regard to the decisive findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.</seg>
<seg id="753">For EU-wide procedures, the orders placed must be made known.</seg>
<seg id="754">The order data are also recorded in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of the procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="756">A carefully and promptly created documentation only makes it possible to understand the award decisions.</seg>
<seg id="757">In particular, it also serves to provide effective legal protection for bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, since the need to give detailed reasons for award decisions considerably limits the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">The relevant contracting authority must notify the Office for Official Publications of the EU of the notice of an order placed in an EU-wide procurement procedure within 48 days.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the relevant national ministries of the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the EU Commission produces EU statistics every year, through which it can obtain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.</seg>

<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">Building administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contract awards and fully meet their reporting and reporting obligations.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH focused on two focal points that are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the awarding of construction works by public authorities: the application of the EU procurement regulations and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a European single market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Anti-corruption measures not only serve to prevent or at least reduce corruption. They are also intended to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two courts of auditors regarding the application of the procurement law regulations in both countries and the comparison of these regulations reveal insights into similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their procurement law and its application.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement rules</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have implemented the EU requirements for the awarding of construction works into national law.</seg>
<seg id="809">This gives the Czech Republic and Germany an important common basis for the awarding of construction services and taking into account the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of the award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">The building authorities of both countries have partially enforced these bids very extensively through further administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements for construction work to be awarded across the EU to its nationally adjustable procurement procedures below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the studies carried out by the audit offices have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="813">The building authorities in Germany should further improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the above-mentioned complaints when implementing the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">The audits in the Czech Republic have primarily identified dangers that affect the profitability of the award.</seg>
<seg id="815">Incomplete service descriptions made additional services necessary, which were often awarded in violation of legal regulations. In addition, the cost calculations were mostly inadequate. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of possible bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the traffic structures.</seg>
<seg id="816">Corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="817">The purpose of the investigations was not to uncover cases of corruption,</seg>
<seg id="818">also because the audit offices do not have the appropriate instruments for this.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the audit offices can check to what extent the administrations of both countries have taken measures against corruption and manipulation when awarding construction services and how these requirements are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">Both countries have different priorities when it comes to preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="821">Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements in the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of the procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which the entire federal administration must apply.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the awarding of construction services and geared to their specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="826">The corresponding regulations partly specify very precisely how the anti-corruption bids are to be taken into account when the award procedure is carried out and when selecting the people involved.</seg>
<seg id="827">According to the BRH, the priority of the principle of the open procedure or the public tender is a suitable instrument in order to be able to significantly reduce the risk of corruption when awarding construction works. However, restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulative interventions.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analyzes and adequate controls (especially the multiple-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of the award procedure as well as various organizational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore sees no fundamental need to change the corresponding requirements of the administrations when awarding construction services.</seg>
<seg id="830">The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The shortcomings identified in some areas have shown deficiencies in the implementation of some requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">The building authorities should train their employees further on the requirements for preventing corruption and raise their awareness of this problem even more.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="834">Without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.</seg>
<seg id="835">Manipulation and corruption-prone tasks should therefore only be delegated to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against unauthorized interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="837">The Czech Republic adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which the area of ​​public procurement is the main component.</seg>
<seg id="838">The public procurement law and the associated implementing provisions have been significantly changed.</seg>
<seg id="839">The NKÚ audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, since the awarding authorities justify the cost-effectiveness of the placing of orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the appropriateness of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the type of evaluations, and properly document and publish all these aspects have to.</seg>
<seg id="841">recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">The NKÚ and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable basis for the awarding of construction works within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as the basis for similar projects that enable and promote cross-border competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous material and non-material damage potential from manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both audit offices see the building authorities in their countries required to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and, if necessary, to improve them.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organization and procedures of the award procedure should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to be able to initiate suitable countermeasures.</seg>
<seg id="847">A comparison of public procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open cases in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open ones offer more scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="848">A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a favorable effect on the offer prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring the correct implementation of the procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient public contracting.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, the tendering procedures are carried out by the specialized building authorities. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks - with the exception of transport construction projects - are carried out by the ministries themselves or contractors commissioned by them.</seg>
<seg id="851">The audit offices of both countries are concerned to continue developing the knowledge that is important to them after the completion of their joint project and, if necessary, to present it to the parliament and government of their country.</seg>
<seg id="852">Both SAIs are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and their implementation are also of international interest to the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). Because the principles and knowledge presented are of general importance in order to counter corruption effectively and to ensure the economic awarding of construction works in a well-functioning and fair competition.</seg>

<seg id="11">In 2006, the auditors of both countries audited for the first time in parallel in the area of ​​VAT.</seg>
<seg id="12">The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the Court of Auditors is required. This enables a comprehensive assessment to be made as to whether the measures taken are suitable for effectively countering VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two SAIs decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Management of sales tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="15">1 Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Exam number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Administration of VAT (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Audit of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKÚ), control audit</seg>
<seg id="18">Exam objective:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The VAT administration and the treatment of selected sales between entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities for intergovernmental assistance should be examined.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit was intended to evaluate how the financial administration implemented the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, other test fields linked to the VAT should be worked on.</seg>
<seg id="22">The findings made here should be compared to determine whether the taxation process can be optimized.</seg>
<seg id="23">The examination period was the years 2006 to 2008 including relevant information from the period before the examination period until the end of the examination.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of results and evaluation of the parallel test</seg>
<seg id="25">The audit offices of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed to carry out an audit to manage VAT.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the previous parallel review, they uncovered suspected intra-community sales,</seg>
<seg id="27">which made a further examination expedient.</seg>
<seg id="28">Based on the audit findings, the two audit offices made recommendations on how to manage VAT.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aim of the control test was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the suspected cases identified should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The examination also dealt with other issues. This included selected cases of high-risk intra-Community sales, mutual administrative assistance in the recovery of VAT claims and the VAT check for large companies.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Court of Auditors found:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous test</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: The regulations for the registration of taxpayers should be harmonized within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">At the first audit, the SAIs compared VAT registration procedures in the two countries and identified differences that caused problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonizing taxpayer registration within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This has also been taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment to Council Regulation No. 1798/2003 provides for the current databases in the EU to be expanded, including a database with the identification number of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="38">The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their deletion.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Court of Auditors expected Member States to agree on appropriate rules, in line with their fundamental decision, to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the latest version of the draft.</seg>
<seg id="41">The common regulations mentioned are no longer included. The two Court of Auditors regret that.</seg>
<seg id="42">They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: monthly submission of the summary reports. As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended that the Member States should submit the summary reports (ZM) monthly in future.</seg>
<seg id="44">The amounts of intra-Community sales could then be checked sooner.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the period for the submission of the tax to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act that came into force on January 1, 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, implementation only came into force on July 1, 2010. It has therefore not transposed the obligation to submit the ZM into national law on time.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Data comparison of VAT pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and suggestion to check the merging of the procedures for VAT pre-registrations and ZM. The German tax authorities took up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group that should work out possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work is still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: exchange about successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level. In the course of the first audit, the two Court of Auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in every EU member state.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States have different risk management systems that have both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Audit Office concentrated on Germany's participation in the "Platform for Risk Management".</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Control check of selected intra-community sales</seg>
<seg id="57">The auditors jointly examined sales at the first check, where it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been declared differently by the taxpayers of the two states in the advance VAT returns (or VAT returns) or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="58">The audit offices selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits by the tax offices (FÄ) of both countries were not yet over when the first parallel audit was completed.</seg>
<seg id="60">The control audit has shown that the tax procedures for these selected sales have now been completed. The respective financial authorities had taken appropriate measures to do this (including the subsequent determination of VAT or the prevention of input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community sales</seg>
<seg id="62">The audit also included highly risky intra-Community sales between taxpayers in the EU, which were recorded in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is used to identify risky taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. H. it does not participate in data exchange within the framework of EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the perspective of an active participating State, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with a German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.</seg>
<seg id="68">The NKU provided both normal transactions and suspected VAT fraud in the selected sales, among other things. a. Carousel fraud, tight.</seg>
<seg id="69">The FÄ could only check sales with high risk to a limited extent. This was particularly the case with so-called "missing traders", whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">If carousel fraud is suspected for imports and exports</seg>
<seg id="71">it is recommended that the customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the end customer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany and a number of other countries have declined to actively participate in EUROCANET because they do not believe there is a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Federal Audit Office found that the German tax authorities use other tools to identify risky taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="74">Nevertheless, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU member states.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation</seg>
<seg id="76">was created by the EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should flow into the planned network to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual administrative assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are processed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Federal Audit Office and the NKU compared the statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">There were discrepancies in these statistics.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two Court of Auditors consider a renewed discussion of the statistics at EU level to be useful in order to avoid inconsistencies that still exist in the future.</seg>
<seg id="84">If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the statistics should include more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">Both Court of Auditors believe that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to at least match the average recovery rate.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Commission should assist Member States in this if so desired.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. VAT check for large companies</seg>
<seg id="90">The Court of Auditors analyzed the legal situation regarding the VAT check for large companies in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they collected information from the financial authorities that they considered important in this context using a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="92">It became clear that the situation is different in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="93">The CZ has a system for the selection of risky cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, data from balance sheets and profit and loss accounts).</seg>
<seg id="94">The overall VAT control can thus be effectively controlled and analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="95">A special tax office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is still no comparable system in Germany. This makes it more difficult to control and analyze the overall VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="97">The German financial administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the advance VAT returns or VAT returns and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="98">Various risk management components that still need to be improved support the evaluation of this data.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">Department II - State Budgetary Income and the regional departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava carried out audits from May 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FÄ: tax office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FA in Hodonín, FA in Hradec Králové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA in Písek, FA in Pilsen, FA Prague 1, FA Prague 4, FA Prague 8, FA in Rakovník, FA in Sokolov, FA in Tábor, FA in Vysoké Mýto, FA in Zlín and FA in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on April 27, 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Examination procedure in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The traffic tax audit area and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the sample cases, they announced the exam in several countries:</seg>
<seg id="107">• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. In addition, they conducted interviews in the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files from the following FÄ were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Central Tax Office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, special tax office Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, discussions were held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two audit offices</seg>
<seg id="112">In advance of the parallel audit, representatives of both audit offices met in September 2008 to discuss and determine the audit topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">In December 2008, the Presidents of both Court of Auditors signed an agreement to cooperate on the parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams briefed themselves on the initial results obtained during the examination preparation, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting took place in Prague from December 2-4, 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The examination teams exchanged the examination results gained up to that point and agreed the schedule for the preparation of the joint examination report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two Court of Auditors identified the following issues for their parallel review: • Evaluation of the recommendations given in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community sales between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany that could not be fully resolved during the first parallel review; • Review of selected intra-Community sales classified as risky between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany; • Examine the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits at large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel review was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Audit the administration of sales tax in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint examination</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Implementation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Harmonization of requirements for registration of taxpayers within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended that the requirements for VAT registration be amended and new rules for deleting the registration in the CZ introduced.</seg>
<seg id="125">These changed rules should more effectively contain the risk of possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="126">In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxpayers if they did not fulfill their obligations under Czech Law No. 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as "VAT Law").</seg>
<seg id="127">So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige the FÄ to delete if taxpayers repeatedly fail to submit VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="128">In accordance with Czech VAT law, the FA may delete a taxpayer's registration ex officio if a) the taxpayer has not made any sales for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons therefor; b) the taxpayer has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; c) the taxpayer no longer meets the requirements for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="129">The first examination had shown that, due to the existing legal situation, the FA Prague 1 had to delete the VAT registration of “foreign taxpayers” 3 with effect from January 31 of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year .</seg>
<seg id="130">The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant determination of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was solved by the amendment to the VAT Act, which came into force on January 1, 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">Accordingly, the FA is authorized to delete the registration of a foreign taxpayer if the latter has not provided taxable or tax-exempted goods or services that are entitled to input tax deduction in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly delivery of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="135">Based on the first review, the audit offices recommended that ZM be introduced monthly.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive, which reduced the frequency for the delivery of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT Act that entered into force on January 1, 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The ZM must now be submitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="138">In addition, a ZM must be submitted if services, the place of fulfillment of which is to be determined in accordance with Section 9 (1) of the VAT Act, are provided for a person registered as VAT liable in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="139">The prerequisite is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services. This obligation results from Council Directive 2008/8 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC with regard to the place of service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of the data from the advance VAT returns and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data. This recommendation related to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="142">In its ATIS4 system, the Czech tax authorities automatically compare the data on intra-Community sales from the VAT returns and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper collection of VAT is an essential prerequisite for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">The fight against VAT fraud is therefore of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.</seg>
<seg id="148">In it, an external expert estimated the VAT loss for the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006. After evaluating the available data, the tax loss for the period mentioned was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros. It was based on the assumption that the EU-25 lose an average of 12% of the VAT they are entitled to each year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first assessment found that a Member State alone cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS).</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in every member state.</seg>
<seg id="152">In relation to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has examined the information exchange system within the EU (EUROCANET).</seg>
<seg id="153">For this purpose, risk-bearing intra-Community sales carried out by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The EUROFISC network aims to optimize administrative assistance in tax matters and combat VAT fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities is to be improved in order to identify fraud cases as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later, EUROFISC could be used as an aid to estimate the risk potential in intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council6 already approved EUROFISC on October 7, 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.</seg>
<seg id="157">The model for EUROFISC is EUROCANET, which was developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7.</seg>
<seg id="158">The purpose of the system is to uncover risky sales and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organized VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Harmonization of conditions for registration of taxpayers within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax authorities have developed a well-functioning system for registering taxpayers based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system itself is constantly being improved.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data given in the questionnaire are now recorded electronically and will later be available for research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission had made a proposal8 to amend Regulation 1798/2003. This saw u. a. common standards for registration and deletion of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Federal Audit Office had advised the Federal Ministry of Finance not to go below the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly delivery of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="172">On April 8, 2010, a law9 to transpose the EU directives into national law was passed.</seg>
<seg id="173">It contains u. a. Provisions for the monthly delivery of the ZM for intra-community deliveries</seg>
<seg id="174">and comes into force on July 1, 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of the data of the VAT advance registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT advance registrations and the ZM</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint federal-state working group was set up</seg>
<seg id="178">who has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the advance VAT returns and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="179">The concept is still being discussed with the countries.</seg>
<seg id="180">This working group also dealt with a concept for optimizing the control procedure for intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level Relevant information is exchanged at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the corresponding initiative and initiated the creation of a risk management platform within the “Fiscalis 2006-2007” action plan in a written procedure on October 18, 2006.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • Risk management instruments, • Influencing the behavior of taxpayers, • Evaluation, • Updating the risk management guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports from the subgroups "Risk Management Instruments" and "Update of the Risk Management Guide" were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The question of the requirements for VAT registration and its deletion in different countries was dealt with at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">Draft Council Regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the expansion of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT Identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">This suggestion includes a. also common standards for registration and deletion of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="192">The questions of registration and deletion are reserved for the national legislation of the EU member states until further notice.</seg>
<seg id="193">The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Federal Audit Office had advised the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Member States reached political agreement on 8 June 2010 in ECOFIN on the latest version of the draft.</seg>
<seg id="196">Common rules for the registration and deletion of taxpayers are no longer included.</seg>
<seg id="197">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="198">The two audit offices regret this. They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly delivery of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="201">With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous review, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly ZM fee to allow an earlier review of the amounts of intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common value added tax system for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the frequency for the submission of the corresponding CM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act that came into force on January 1, 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not implement the obligation to pay the monthly ZM levy until July 1, 2010 and therefore not on time, while the CZ complied with the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of the data of the VAT advance registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT advance registrations or the ZM</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax authorities took up the recommendations of the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to work out possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">The Federal Audit Office focused on Germany's participation in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Control check of selected intra-Community sales</seg>
<seg id="213">The first check jointly examined sales where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether there had been discrepancies in the taxpayer's declarations in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two audit offices selected nine cases of intra-Community supplies of goods between CZ and Germany for the control audit, for which the tax audit by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">A Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the purchase in his VAT return, since German taxpayers did not have a VAT identification number during the mentioned period, but only a tax number for domestic German sales.</seg>
<seg id="218">Through international administrative assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the responsible Czech FA had received information that under German VAT law the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a VAT identification number in order to be able to claim the tax exemption for intra-Community goods deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="219">The control audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that - according to the examination of the responsible Czech FA - the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration, in which he declared the purchase of goods in the above-mentioned value and at the same time asserted his right to deduct input tax in the same amount .</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">A Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">However, he stated that he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not declare them in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax authorities refused, based on a provision of the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15,000.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech FA was unable to obtain any documents, the tax audit was unsuccessful and the original tax assessment remained.</seg>
<seg id="225">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA from Germany received two spontaneous reports in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxpayer had charged the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxpayer purchased the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the purchase in his regular VAT return for October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">A Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased a car worth EUR 48,500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, he did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, he had not submitted a VAT return since August 2004. The FA therefore set the VAT for the quarter in question at CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="231">Based on information received from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA asked the taxpayer to submit a subsequent tax return in March 2007, which the taxpayer failed to do.</seg>
<seg id="232">The control audit determined that the FA had undertaken further audit procedures in 2007 in this tax case. It found that the taxpayer had sold the car in question to a used car dealer in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the December 2004 taxation period, imposing additional taxes of CZK 295 379 on the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="234">The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings against the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of any significant assets, the outstanding tax liability should be irrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">A Czech taxpayer is said to have delivered new vehicles (cars) totaling 198,167 euros to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="238">In response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, it was stated that tax criminal proceedings in Germany were pending against the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="239">The audit carried out by the Federal Audit Office showed that, after the proceedings had been completed, there was evidence that the German taxpayer was involved in fraud.</seg>
<seg id="240">The intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to income tax of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud with new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="242">Based on information from the German tax authorities, the Czech taxpayer was audited for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">Based on the audit findings and information from the international exchange of information, the FA assessed additional VAT of CZK 703,031 for May 2005 and CZK 726,551 for June 2005.</seg>

<seg id="245">Czech taxpayer A is said to have acquired a machine with a total value of 58,000 euros from a German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="246">The German taxpayer is said to have supplied Czech taxpayer B with a machine worth EUR 88 027 in the third quarter of 2004. B, however, denied the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had bought the machine from a German company with a branch in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech taxpayer A did not state the purchase of the goods from the aforementioned German taxpayer in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">The German FA's response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth EUR 58,000, but delivery within the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the control audit, the Federal Audit Office found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as a domestic delivery after the completion of an operational inspection and the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">A German taxpayer is said to have delivered goods worth EUR 11,600 to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and later, i.e. H. sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which unlawfully identified purchases from another Member State, including those in the above amount.</seg>
<seg id="255">The Federal Audit Office found that after receiving a response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and set additional VAT of EUR 1,600.</seg>
<seg id="256">An examination is underway regarding the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there.</seg>
<seg id="257">The DM of the German taxpayer has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxpayer who submitted the DM can correct it.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The responsible Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax authorities in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the question of the purchase of a car worth EUR 47,400 by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After an examination for the taxation period 2005, the Czech FA set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech taxpayer had been canceled because he had failed to meet his tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="262">The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax assessment.</seg>

<seg id="265">According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer delivered goods to a Czech taxpayer with a total value of EUR 33 205, which the latter did not, however, declare as an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="266">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer repeatedly made subsequent VAT returns for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech FA was nevertheless unable to clarify the difference in the amount of CZK 134,273 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this with the fact that sales for individual quarters could not be allocated exactly and accepted the submitted VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer delivered goods worth EUR 46,854 to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">As part of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA checked the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="273">With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of EUR 31,998, i.e. H. an amount equal to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="274">According to the results of the control audit by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer submitted a subsequent VAT return for the July 2004 taxation period after repeated warnings from the FA.</seg>
<seg id="275">With this declaration, the taxpayer also claimed his right to deduct input tax. His tax liability for the taxation period in question therefore remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The control audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures for the sales selected for the audit had been completed and that the tax authorities in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including ex-post VAT fixing or prevention of input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Review of selected cases of risky intra-Community sales</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be an important source of information for identifying risky taxpayers in the Member State of purchase.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the responsible FA at the buyers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has entered information about sales and taxable suppliers that are considered to be at risk into the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,</seg>
<seg id="283">which have been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States as either suppliers or buyers.</seg>
<seg id="284">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German tax authorities did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="286">Both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud were found during the audit.</seg>
<seg id="287">In these cases, the FÄ exchanged information according to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,</seg>
<seg id="288">e.g. B .:</seg>
<seg id="289">• When reviewing the early warning information, the FÄ found no suspicion of risky sales.</seg>
<seg id="290">The taxpayers concerned were continuously monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• During the reviews of the risky sales, the FÄ did not succeed in proving violations of the regulations for the calculation of the tax base and the VAT on the basis of the submitted accounting documents, although they discovered inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or uncovered business relationships with letterbox companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• The review of individual business transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not work with the FÄ and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The responsible FÄs checked most of the risky taxpayers and sales mentioned in early warning reports from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="294">Your options for checking risky sales, especially so-called “missing traders”, are limited.</seg>
<seg id="295">In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide evidence of fraudulent behavior by the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="296">Stricter tax registration requirements for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would help to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="297">The taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for VAT purposes, to fake EU-wide fictitious goods deliveries or to issue other taxpayers formally correct tax documents with which they can then claim unjustified input tax deductions.</seg>
<seg id="298">If carousel fraud is suspected in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that the customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the end customer.</seg>
<seg id="299">Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not take part was considered by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 to be a weakness in the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Findings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were checked.</seg>
<seg id="304">Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Therefore, Germany has a passive status, i.e. H. it does not send any data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">The reason for this is that “from the perspective of the Federal Government</seg>
<seg id="307">no unequivocal legal basis [exists] that would allow the tax secrecy existing in Germany to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Federal Government has no reliable knowledge of how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET. ”12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities based on a coordinated process.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German FÄ receive control messages on the direct business relationships recorded in EUROCANET of the taxpayers registered with them with companies from other EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the respective German IA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU member state has business relationships with a company based in another member state that is also in business relationship with the German company from the control notice.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From an active participant's point of view, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="314">Accordingly, the test had to be carried out differently in this area.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, there were no significant differences in success in detecting VAT fraud. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other tools to uncover fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13 that created EUROFISC, a network to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained with EUROCANET so far should be exchanged by the member states at European level and incorporated into this network.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">The cases brought to court nationally and at European level show that there is a need for a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemption on intra-Community transactions.</seg>

<seg id="322">4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in debt recovery in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">Legislation on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on</seg>
<seg id="324">Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and of levies and duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">Council Directive 2001/44 / EC amending Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and of levies and duties and regarding VAT and certain excise duties and</seg>
<seg id="326">of Commission Directive 2002/94 / EC laying down detailed implementing rules for certain articles of Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims in connection with certain taxes, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308 / EEC through Law No. 252/2000 on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">After the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44 / EC, this also had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, an amendment to the aforementioned law was required.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, the amendment to the law No. 191/2004 regarding the intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims was passed.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new relevant legal regulation was enacted by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1179/2008 of November 28, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms that are to be used from January 1, 2009. Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission compulsory and obliges the requesting authority to certify that all documents sent are in accordance with the original.</seg>
<seg id="332">The main principles of international administrative assistance for the recovery of claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. The principle of reciprocity applies;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. Administrative assistance is only to be provided on request and when all requirements are met;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. Assistance does not extend to claims that are considered criminal penalties in the requested state;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. The procedure for intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. In the recovery process, foreign claims have no priority over domestic claims;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. Administrative assistance is only provided for the recovery of uncontested claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. The principle of exhaustion applies: the requesting state must use all means to which it is entitled under national law to collect the claim.</seg>
<seg id="340">Law No. 191/2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: providing information, serving legal acts and the actual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states</seg>
<seg id="342">The responsible FA must transmit the request for information, the request for the delivery of legal acts or the request for recovery together with the relevant documents electronically to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ via the respective finance directorate.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the relevant language, scans it with all attachments and sends it via the communication network or the common CCN / CSI interface to the competent tax authority of the state concerned.</seg>
<seg id="344">A request for recovery assistance must meet the following requirement: the claim must exceed EUR 1,500 and must not be older than five years.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority may refuse to recover if the requirements are not met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Incoming request procedure from other Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">The Ministry of Finance of the CZ must acknowledge receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.</seg>
<seg id="348">If it decides not to accept the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the rejection and state the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="349">The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">After receiving the request, the Treasury Department checks whether the request meets all legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="351">It should then send the request to the relevant FA through the relevant finance directorate. If the recovery request is granted, the FA u. a. to determine the debtor's financial situation, e.g. B. by extracts from the land register, inquiries about existing bank accounts and registration of motor vehicles with the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="352">After six months from the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ should inform the requesting authority of the result of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="353">The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxpayers concerned cannot be reached and the claim cannot therefore be collected.</seg>
<seg id="354">All successfully collected amounts must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech FA dealing with the recovery can, with the consent of the requesting state, arrange the payment or arrange payment in installments.</seg>
<seg id="356">The interest or default surcharge imposed on the debtor for the delayed period in accordance with Law No. 337/1992 on the administration of taxes and fees</seg>
<seg id="357">are entitled to the requesting state.</seg>
<seg id="358">In 2006 and 2007 in particular, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ delayedly forwarded the recovery requests received to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="359">The same was true for the forwarding of the recovery requests made by the Czech FA to the competent authority in the requested state.</seg>
<seg id="360">The review found that the Treasury has violated the Intergovernmental Assistance Law for the Recovery of Claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="361">The situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">According to Section 13 (4) of Law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ produces statistics for the European Commission by March 15 of each year. This contains the number of requests for information, the delivery of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims, which were submitted in the previous year and received.</seg>
<seg id="364">Based on the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission prepares its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the rules on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit found that the Ministry of Finance of the CZ declared the claims by 5,250,000 euros too low in 2008. The reason was the incorrect statement regarding the amount of a VAT claim brought in in 2008 (caused by the shifting of a decimal point when converting the claim from Czech crowns into euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual recovery assistance is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 Intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany</seg>

<seg id="374">Section 117 (2) of the AO stipulates that the tax authorities can provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international law contracts and the legal norms of the European Communities applicable in national law as well as the EC Mutual Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part six of the AO (§§ 249-346) contains the legal provisions for the enforcement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative actions of the financial authorities regulate in particular the execution and enforcement instructions.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the highest financial authorities of the federal states on the principles of administrative assistance in tax matters and transferred its own responsibility in this area to the Federal Central Tax Office18.</seg>
<seg id="378">General requirements for the admissibility of a request for recovery assistance are:</seg>
<seg id="379">• The legal requirements must be met (§§ 251, 254 AO).</seg>

<seg id="403">A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between the CZ and Germany were selected for the audit. Below are ten cases where u. a.</seg>
<seg id="404">The following was found:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On October 20, 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT debts of a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 in the total amount of 3 883 euros (109 820 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="407">It was only on February 26, 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the debt to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a lien.</seg>
<seg id="409">As the encumbered property was not sufficient to settle the entire tax liability, an installment payment agreement of at least CZK 2,000 per month was made with the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="410">On August 31, 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. As a result, the taxpayer had in the meantime paid tax debts of CZK 49,600 (as of August 25, 2009).</seg>
<seg id="411">The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly afterwards, on August 28, 2009, another 3,000 CZK were transferred.</seg>
<seg id="412">2nd</seg>
<seg id="413">On January 7, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery request for tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totaling EUR 180 869 (= CZK 4,434,915).</seg>
<seg id="414">It was only on November 27, 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="415">After reviewing bank balances, securities, real estate, automobiles and other movable property, the FA found that the debtor did not have attachable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Local investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">The Czech Ministry of Finance received this notification on April 6, 2009 and forwarded it to the German tax authorities on April 16, 2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3rd</seg>
<seg id="420">On November 21, 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT plus interest and fees totaling EUR 3 139 (= CZK 84 846).</seg>
<seg id="421">It was only on August 6, 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA. On February 18, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech taxpayer had paid the debt in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="422">On December 9, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case was closed because the Czech taxpayer had paid his debt in full in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the debt was also settled in the Czech Republic as part of the recovery process and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on October 27, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Because of the long time it took for the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer in Germany and through recovery by the responsible Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the Federal Audit Office, it was found that the amount recovered will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounts to EUR 6 649 and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance there was only a recovery request for the company concerned in the amount of 3 139 euros. The recovery request in the amount of 6 649 euros could not be found there.</seg>
<seg id="427">4th</seg>
<seg id="428">On September 15, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totaling EUR 39 957 = CZK 956 654.</seg>
<seg id="429">It was only on December 19, 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="430">On June 1, 2009, the recovery process was initiated. A decision was taken to seize the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7,000).</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor disagreed with the amount of the tax liability and disputed the amount.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech FA, the debtor had previously been willing to pay EUR 250 per month, but the German FA responsible did not agree to this.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxpayer agreed to discuss the matter with the German FA in order to agree on another amount.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery process had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On November 19, 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax for 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totaling 113,444 euros = 3,116,304 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="437">It was only on November 14, 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the FA Prague 1, which is authorized to process tax cases for taxpayers not resident in the CZ; Based on the available address, a locally responsible FA could not be determined.</seg>
<seg id="438">In its investigation, the FA received information and documents on September 19, 2008, according to which the debtor's income was EUR 4 704. However, it could not issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On January 26, 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to attach the debtor's credit balances to banks.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery process had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On October 3, 2006, the responsible Czech FA asked for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery due to a VAT liability plus procedural costs totaling CZK 146,223,742.</seg>
<seg id="443">It was only on May 13, 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="444">On September 8, 2008, the German FA responsible transferred the amount of EUR 17,700 = CZK 439,226 to the Czech authorities through the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="445">A conversion error was discovered while reviewing the amounts raised.</seg>
<seg id="446">The amount to be recovered of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at the exchange rate of 1 EUR = CZK 25.065, however, an amount of EUR 583 378 resulted from a comma error.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct amount to be recovered was EUR 5 833 782.</seg>
<seg id="448">As a result, a recovery request was made which was too low by EUR 5 250 404.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On March 1, 2007, the responsible Czech FA asked for recovery due to a VAT liability plus interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totaling CZK 1,970,632 = EUR 79,847.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not forward the recovery request to the German tax authorities until November 10, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="452">On February 4, 2009, the German FA requested the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's sales in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability. On April 8, 2009 - 4,600 euros, on May 6, 2009 - 3,000 euros and on June 16, 2009 - 2,500 euros.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were transferred to the account of the responsible FA in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On June 23, 2009, a further payment of € 2,500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA by June 30, 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8th.</seg>
<seg id="457">On May 22, 2008, the responsible Czech FA asked for tax debts totaling 398 653 euros = CZK 9 832 779; in it was u. a. Real estate transfer tax included.</seg>
<seg id="458">It was only on October 2, 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="459">In a letter from the German tax authorities to the Czech Ministry of Finance on April 3, 2009, the request was returned.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax authorities justified this by saying that the real estate transfer tax is not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 e), f), g) and h) of Directive 2008/55 / ​​EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">Article 2 (g) also relates to tax liabilities on income and property.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55 / ​​EC applies to taxes on income and assets that are not mentioned in Article 1, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed that a new request for recovery be sent to the German tax authorities, which should no longer include the land transfer tax arrears of CZK 61,759, but the arrears in VAT, corporate and income tax.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On February 6, 2006, the responsible Czech FA submitted a request for recovery of income tax and VAT totaling CZK 3,445,782 = EUR 123,328 to the Czech Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="467">The VAT liability was CZK 1 133 967.</seg>
<seg id="468">It was only on April 18, 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="469">and only on November 11, 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance send the Czech FA the response from the German tax authorities on July 9, 2007,</seg>
<seg id="470">according to which the German FA on June 11, 2007 issued an enforcement order to attach the bank account. The bank said that it had no business relationship with the taxpayer mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="471">The request was therefore completed for the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="472">10th</seg>
<seg id="473">On September 26, 2005, the responsible Czech FA submitted to the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for VAT debts totaling CZK 1,296,845 = EUR 43,591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The relevant finance directorate sent the request to the Treasury on October 10, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German tax authorities on December 15, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before submitting the request, the Czech FA enforced the tax claim by seizing the bank accounts and garnishing it, and by debiting a property.</seg>
<seg id="477">Before the recovery request, the German tax authorities received a request for information on March 16, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">According to the reply to the Czech FA from September 16, 2005, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from self-employment of EUR 8,437. The Czech Ministry of Finance received an answer to the recovery request on April 20, 2006 and only forwarded it to the relevant Czech FA on February 12, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="479">According to this, the tax liability in Germany is irrecoverable due to the debtor's insolvency.</seg>
<seg id="480">No assets were found, the income from employment was already the subject of other enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German tax authorities therefore considered the request to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of recovery, the provisions of EU law apply to intergovernmental administrative assistance for all EU member states.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The Federal Audit Office and the NKÚ compared the statistics that the two Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">There were discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 20062020 report, the European Commission recommended that the Member States take greater care in compiling their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite the larger number of requests for assistance, the inconsistencies in the statistics have decreased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both Court of Auditors consider a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics to be useful so that the remaining inconsistencies can be avoided in the future.</seg>
<seg id="490">If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the Court of Auditors believes that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the nature of the claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amounts recovered per Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by the Member States, the Commission could help Member States assess their anti-fraud measures.</seg>
<seg id="493">As the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors recommend that Member States with a lower rate should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.</seg>
<seg id="495">The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the relevant FÄ with delay, particularly in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="496">The same applies to requests for recovery made by the Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="497">The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance violated Law 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery aid in that it did not notify the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period following confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 VAT check for large companies</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Sales tax check for large companies in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General</seg>
<seg id="501">The taxation process for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="502">The examination of large companies is regulated in Czech Law No. 337/1992, the "Tax and Fee Management Act".</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large companies as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been founded to pursue a business and whose net turnover for the relevant taxation period is at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.</seg>
<seg id="504">The taxpayer is classified as a large company based on the amount of sales according to the income or corporate tax return in the respective taxation period; for the first time in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A natural or legal person is no longer run as a large enterprise for the purposes of sales taxation if, in three successive assessment periods, its net sales in the taxation period are less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins with the end of the taxation period for which the conditions were fulfilled for the first time according to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="506">A taxpayer can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one tax type has been checked for a taxation period beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="507">Up to the end of 2009, all large companies were checked at least every five years.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, taxpayers have been assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on the proper tax assessment and collection.</seg>
<seg id="509">The examinations by the FÄ should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually span several tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="510">The large companies subject to tax were checked by the special inspection bodies or inspection services set up by the responsible FÄ at a total of 13 FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="511">A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of ​​responsibility according to the instructions of the head of the finance directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">She also checked</seg>
<seg id="513">Taxpayers with unusual and special business activities and</seg>
<seg id="514">those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.</seg>
<seg id="515">Taxpayers with a complex location and organizational structure are also examined,</seg>
<seg id="516">Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion</seg>
<seg id="517">and taxpayers belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified input tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information on the number of inspections carried out by the special inspection bodies of the FÄ and the additional tax results of these inspections are shown in Table No. 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has made a proposal to the regional tax authorities to amend Law No. 531/1990. In particular, it is proposed to set up a special tax office with nationwide responsibility for selected taxpayers (legal entities established for the purpose of commercial activity with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Sales tax check for large companies in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General</seg>
<seg id="522">The VAT check of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. For general tax audits, the general regulations apply: • the tax code (AO), • the financial management act (FVG) and • the tax code (BpO).</seg>
<seg id="523">There are also working aids.</seg>
<seg id="524">Tax Code</seg>
<seg id="525">The provisions of Sections 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 -External Examination" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external examination and its factual scope, division of responsibilities, form and content of the examination announcement, examination principles, duty of the taxpayer and requirements for final discussions and for the transmission of the Exam report.</seg>
<seg id="526">External examinations are carried out by the responsible FÄ (§ 195 AO).</seg>
<seg id="527">Financial Administration Act According to Section 5 Paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with Section 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits by the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and scope of this cooperation are agreed between the authorities involved.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office can request that certain companies it names are checked at a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="530">In this case, it can lay down rules for the external audits of these taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="531">Audit regulations In accordance with Article 108 paragraph 7 of the Basic Law, the audit regulations (BpO 2000) were issued with the approval of the Federal Council.</seg>
<seg id="532">It applies to external audits by the state tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">According to § 3 BpO, the companies are regularly classified into size classes.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large companies are subject to a connection test (section 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">Pursuant to section 33.1 BpO, each responsible tax authority must keep a group directory in accordance with the regulation.</seg>
<seg id="536">Administrative tools</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the following work aids have been issued for the administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">• "Uniform manual for the special VAT audit";</seg>
<seg id="539">• Sales tax country online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with instructions for using the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relationships;</seg>
<seg id="540">• Working aids for difficult and special situations.</seg>
<seg id="541">• Central database for storing and evaluating VAT fraud cases and developing risk profiles - MAGIC;</seg>
<seg id="542">Taxpayers are classified into size categories. These are based on criteria such as sales and profits, whereby the limit values ​​differ depending on the business line.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">The values ​​are checked every three years and set for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies - not just large ones - can be determined regularly (last reporting date: January 1, 2010).</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, large companies have to be checked completely.</seg>
<seg id="547">The exams are announced and usually extend to VAT,</seg>
<seg id="548">d. that is, the test covers all relevant taxes, namely income tax, corporate tax, trade tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="549">The sales tax can be checked either by tax auditors or special auditors.</seg>
<seg id="550">The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of taxation periods covered by an audit usually fluctuates between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">The BpO 2000 is based on three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes that a company has been assessed for are subject to the audit.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of sales tax audits for large companies</seg>
<seg id="555">As agreed, both auditors did not examine individual cases. You have investigated the question of how the financial authorities deal with the VAT audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="556">Using a questionnaire, they gathered information from the financial authorities that is essential for the auditing of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="557">• Which statistical records and evaluations for the VAT check of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there statistics or records of the extent to which a distinction is made between combating VAT fraud and general VAT auditing?</seg>
<seg id="560">CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax authorities do not differentiate between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there statistics or records of the timeliness of the exams?</seg>
<seg id="563">CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected VAT payers is recorded in the ATIS system;</seg>
<seg id="564">The same applies to information about the start and end of the FA exam.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the statistics for federal auditors summarized at the federal level only contain information on the so-called average last audit period (year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This number does not provide an overview of the examination periods selected for individual companies.</seg>
<seg id="567">Special VAT auditors concentrate on the last VAT assessment periods and are also authorized to audit large companies.</seg>
<seg id="568">The federal statistics for special auditors contain no information on the size of the audited company.</seg>
<seg id="569">• Are there statistics or records of the type of additional result; e.g. B. divided into:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. real additional result (e.g. application of a reduced instead of the general VAT rate)</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. improper additional result (e.g. relocation / postponement of a fact that is not objectionable under VAT law to another taxation period)</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. Cash effectiveness (payment of the stipulated additional result)</seg>
<seg id="573">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax authorities monitor the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of additional taxable income broken down by tax type, the number of taxpayers audited and the number of taxation periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (on-site investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Regardless of this, the amount of additional payments and incoming payments are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Tax debt statistics are broken down by tax type. However, no distinction is made between tax debts that have arisen from a tax return and those that result from audit procedures by the FA.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the statistics summarized at federal level for auditors and special auditors do not differentiate according to the criteria mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="579">Most tax authorities, where local surveys were carried out, did not differentiate in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are exam fields with high results recorded?</seg>
<seg id="581">CZ: Yes, the FA can select examination cases based on criteria that are linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for tax auditors and special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="585">According to this, auditors and tax investigators of the federal states have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded in ZAUBER.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. B. about the origin of the additional VAT result achieved.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="589">- Large companies subject to tax have unjustifiably claimed input tax deduction for purchased goods and services,</seg>
<seg id="590">• which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity in accordance with § 72 (1) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which were used for representation expenses in accordance with § 75 (3) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="592">• based on invoices that do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG</seg>
<seg id="593">- Large companies subject to tax have failed to register VAT to be paid as provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="595">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for tax auditors and special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="596">The states do not separately record VAT statements from large company audits.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, the Federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database, in which the country's auditors and tax investigators are required to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the financial administration analyze audit fields with significant results and draw consequences for their strategic management?</seg>
<seg id="599">CZ: Yes, e.g. For example, nationwide audits are carried out for risky goods and industries.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="601">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for tax auditors and special auditors do not provide any information about particularly “productive” audit fields.</seg>
<seg id="602">There were different views among the survey agencies regarding the analysis of such information, the benefits and the manner in which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some senior finance directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but the FÄU is free to use it or not.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">As a result, it should be noted that large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the system.</seg>
<seg id="606">The CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases using a wide range of information.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT audits in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In the CZ, a special tax office for large companies is planned for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax authorities do not collect comparable amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="610">Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="611">The focus is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="612">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the information in advance VAT returns or VAT declarations as well as test notes, qualified auditors select the cases to be checked and ensure the appropriate taxation.</seg>
<seg id="614">Appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be introduced in order to reduce revenue losses in VAT and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="615">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="616">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation between the two audit offices has proven itself.</seg>
<seg id="619">In this way, necessary knowledge about the systems used in both countries could be obtained: This applies in particular to: • Intra-Community sales, • Risk management at VAT, particularly with regard to the selection of risky sales, • Collection of VAT claims and • VAT audits of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="620">The audit revealed differences in strategies to detect VAT fraud and in the systems discussed above.</seg>
<seg id="621">These findings can be used to improve existing processes.</seg>
<seg id="622">They can also be used to initiate a discussion with the interested parties as to which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud. This applies e.g. B. for the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The experience and knowledge gained should encourage future audits of the administration of VAT together.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communique</seg>
<seg id="625">The report has been prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the Presidents of the Czech Court of Auditors and the Federal Audit Office.</seg>
<seg id="626">State of information: June 2010.</seg>
