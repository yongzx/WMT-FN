<seg id="3">High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising living standards in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ensuring rapid, safe, reliable and economic transport of people and goods is an important task for the State.</seg>
<seg id="5">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="6">It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the development and development of a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises must often be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely because of the necessary environmental measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="9">In planning and allocating the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources through careful action and decision-making and use them for other useful purposes.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of the State audit authorities is to identify deficiencies in the optimum efficiency, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the construction of transport facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The auditing authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also submit proposals for improvements to them for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Court of Auditors (Brh) and the Nejvyší controlní Úřad motorway</seg>
<seg id="14">The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cooperation with the NKDP enabled the Brh to carry out an in-depth study of the economic viability of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">As part of the cooperation with the Brh Data of German bridges and tunnels, the NKDP received for its own cost comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">In line with progress in planning, the deadline for completion was finally set at the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the award procedure, however, the road and motorway directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) was subject to errors which delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor ensured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, RMD had to accept significant extra costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint audit, the prices of motorway bridges at D 8 and A 17 were compared. The scale for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.</seg>
<seg id="24">A price analysis using statistical methods identified high cost bridges per square metre.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis showed that the border bridge between the large bridges with lengths of more than 100 m was the most expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was also due to the increase in prices due to delays in the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The comparison of prices for tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels under D 8 are considerably higher than those of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">In future studies of the economics of transport infrastructure expenditure, both Brh and NKDP can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both stations recommend standardising bridge structures and carrying out composite and special steel structures only where prestressed concrete structures are inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The course was characterised by team work and an open approach.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel examination, the auditors of both sides exchanged their expertise and expertise.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report deals with the parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Dresden motorway to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">Audit priorities were rigour, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel tests led to the Brh in Germany and the NKDP in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The NKDP examined the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway, amounting to approx. 20 billion CZK gross (approx. €690 million).</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million will come from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">The Brh had already examined the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway, irrespective of the parallel tests with the NKDP in the years 2003 to 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The financial volume for the construction of all three sections of A 17 of approx. €670 million will be co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Corridor IV Dresden - Central and South-Eastern Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,</seg>
<seg id="43">The A 17 from the border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the test, the sections of the motorways close to the border were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both sections were released for marketing on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the motorway is thus completed on the German side up to Dresden, the D 8 on the Czech side remains incomplete, since the length of the line 0805 is still between Rehlovice and Lovosice over 16.4 km</seg>
<seg id="47">Here it is planned to cross a landscape protection area in the Bohemian Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Czech 2001 forecasts, traffic in 2008 will be 22 940 cars per day in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="49">German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 on the Czech border in 2010 to around 25 000 cars per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a contract for the interconnection of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 on the common national border by establishing a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since both countries are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction operation was an important aspect of the parallel audits carried out by the two audit offices.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between Brh and NKDP</seg>
<seg id="53">From mid-2005, the two audit offices held joint discussions on cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany partly finances the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.</seg>
<seg id="58">There was no possibility for the fire to examine this project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The NKDP did not have comparative data to assess whether the funds were being used sparingly for the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels at D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The NKDP also had to examine the effectiveness of expenditure. To this end, the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border, should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory negotiations, the Presidents of the two audit offices concluded on 04 January 2006 an agreement on the coordination of the audits of the Prague-Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="64">The auditors of the two audit offices met at about six to eight week intervals during 2006.</seg>
<seg id="65">They dealt with current problems and challenges. They developed a uniform methodology for testing the prices of bridges and tunnels, exchanged results on the construction of the bridge and produced joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">The day-to-day exchange of information was essential to the cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the Brh focused mainly on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the award procedures, the NKD2 mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs, as well as the way in which the two audit offices complete their audits.</seg>
<seg id="69">For this reason, both authorities prepared separate national reports on their audit results.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report takes account of the results of the two parallel tests.</seg>
<seg id="71">Cooperation ends with the signature of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the Treaty of 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete, as far as possible, the border bridge in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">Later, it will postpone the date by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as the principal contractor of the construction operation.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany finances 42.13% of the construction of bridges.</seg>
<seg id="77">First, the RMD provided for a prestressed concrete construction for the boundary bridge.</seg>
<seg id="78">However, the RMD agreed with its German partner on the construction of a composite steel structure in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="79">They justified this decision with the consequent reduction in the number of pillar pairs from seven to five and the ecological benefits to the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had identified the composite steel structure as the more cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, this was due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation was based on a length of the new composite steel structure of only 397 m.</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, however, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award procedure, the RMD suffered serious errors:</seg>
<seg id="85">By insufficiently preparing the tender documents, it described both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria in detail.</seg>
<seg id="86">These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Evaluation Commission and the Director-General of the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="87">An undersigned tenderer shall challenge the outcome of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation by the Czech Cartel Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a result, the summer season following the offer test was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="90">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time. This led to a substantial increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="91">The measures offered included the double assembly of superstructures, the modification of the pillar shape and the erection of an assembly hall.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the contractor was unable to obtain the original steel grade.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel - the higher cost of which is about €4 million from the contracting entity alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time planned for corrosion protection and thus the total construction time.</seg>
<seg id="94">In comparison with the offer price of approx. €18.3 million net will substantially increase the overall construction costs of the border bridge as a result of the acceleration measures and further additions.</seg>
<seg id="95">The reduction in construction time alone led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">The cost, without price monitoring, is currently about ECU 10 million. €25.9 million net (in October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both auditors examined bridge prices at D 8 and A 17 to identify bridges which were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels on D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4 because there were no comparable tunnels on A 17.</seg>
<seg id="101">In the preparation of this part of the audit, a precise definition of the price concept was important.</seg>
<seg id="102">For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts agreed on detailed specifications, for example: To use the current VAT-free price paid for the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="103">(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany vary and may change. ), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the European Central Bank's exchange rate of 30.12.2005 for the currency conversion. (29 CZK = €1).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of various types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, composite steel and steel) and different sizes are present on both D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their type of construction.</seg>
<seg id="106">The analyses also took account of bridge size within these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on D 8 and 36 bridges on A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The study focused on this type of bridge, since the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The study showed that the m ² price of concrete bridges at D 8 / A 17 depends on the size of the bridge (length, roadway area): The larger the bridge, the lower the square metre price.</seg>
<seg id="110">In the case of German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than in the case of Czech bridges (see Figures below).</seg>
<seg id="111">On A 17, two bridges with a significantly higher price were found on D 8 and on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges were partly determined by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (using the distance to the regression curve), atypical bridges can be identified.</seg>
<seg id="113">However, the atypical price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges should be concentrated.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw final conclusions, the reasons for the respective high price should be identified on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id="115">This could be due, for example, to uneconomic management, but also to environmental protection requirements or other justified reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Taking into account the greater average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length suggested that the Czech concrete bridges were cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">In addition, labour costs in the Czech Republic were lower than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of concrete bridges at D 8 is higher than at A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">Two reasons for this situation were identified at joint meetings:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mostly awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="122">This also allows small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the award competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of long motorway sections.</seg>
<seg id="124">Orders of this size cannot be handled by small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge structures built is greater than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the NKDP noted that the construction of bridges will be determined long before construction starts.</seg>
<seg id="128">This is already the case at the time of the submission of the application for a plan statement by the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this point in time, it selects a particular type of bridge from several alternatives. Economic efficiency, however, plays a minor role in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">Only by carrying out a thorough analysis of the construction industries of both countries would it have been possible to reach a final conclusion on bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. This would, however, have outstripped the scope of this examination.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive composite steel bridge at D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">The prices for the D 8 tunnel are about twice as high as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on D 8 and the tunnels in Germany did not reveal any significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The significant price differences may be the result of underdeveloped competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow general conclusions to be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="136">Efficiency and efficiency of the Dresden-Prague motorway</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the extension of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The aim was to gradually extend the D 8 from Prague to the German border.</seg>
<seg id="140">In this connection, the 0805 section should be built by the Bohemian central mountain before the 0807 section close to the border.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic finances D 8 within the framework of programme funding.</seg>
<seg id="142">The number 327 220 'Construction of the D 8 Prague motorway - Ústí nad Labem - Czech German border' defines two objectives:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">As a national objective: To improve the link between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">As an international objective: The link between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.</seg>
<seg id="147">The programme provided for the completion of the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the date of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The NKDP noted that the planning decision had already been adopted for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental associations have appealed against this decision.</seg>
<seg id="151">A final judgment is still awaited.</seg>
<seg id="152">In comparison with the schedule provided for in the programme documentation, therefore, a delay of several years in the completion of section 0805 could not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of construction section No 0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD undertook an economic study of the border-related section No 0807 of D 8 and the section No 0805 by the Bohemian Central Mountains in the years 1999 to 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">As an investment cost, it accounted for about half of the total cost of the project. €639 million for both sections 0805 and 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the profitability study (EIRR = Internal rate of interest)</seg>
<seg id="158">Alternative opening of all planned motorways and highways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic in the north of the border section is 18 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">Opening of all planned motorways and highways, as well as of both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Transport in the north of the border section of 22 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">Opening of all planned motorways and highways, as well as of both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic in the north of the border section is 25 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the cross-border section and the section passing through the Bohemian Central Mountains would be carried at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the audit, it was obvious that the Bohemian Central Mountains will not open the section at the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This reduces the above-mentioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The cost of both sections was €897 million without VAT at 31 December 2005. This is 27.4% higher than in the economic analysis in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will be given another more costly course of time, which would affect the economic viability of the project.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of motorway with a daily volume of at least 18 000 cars per day in 2010 was economically justified. The forecast for 2008 was 22 940 cars per day.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section by the Bohemian central mountain is based on a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 cars per day in 2007. The project is then below the economic limit.</seg>
<seg id="171">A higher volume of traffic on the routes to replace the missing section with the Bohemian central mountain is likely to result in congestion and increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The above-mentioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the cross-border section of D 8 will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the section of D 8 close to the border is therefore uneconomical.</seg>
<seg id="174">In the construction of A 17, costs also increased, as in the construction of the two abovementioned sections of D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the context of the overall economic evaluation for the 1992 Federal Transport Plan, the Federal Ministry responsible for Transport was dependent on investment costs of about €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">It thus established a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, the costs have increased to around €670 million and reduced the benefit / cost ratio by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">The Brh had examined the economic viability of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway, irrespective of the parallel tests with the NKDP in the years 2003 to 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">He noted that the authority responsible for the authorisation required an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of A 17.</seg>
<seg id="180">The Brh managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the Road Administration of the flood of the Landscape Tunnel during the course of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="181">This avoided €10 million in construction costs and €150 000 in annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">In examining the first section of A 17, the Brh found that the construction operation was insufficiently prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">In the planning phase, the road management waived the status of the rock on the surface of the Dölzsch wall, since it was difficult to access it.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was only when the tunnel drivages reached the wall that it recovered.</seg>
<seg id="186">This showed that the rock was more weathered than was assumed in the call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="187">Complex measures such as anchorages, injections and rock impact protection nets were needed for some €3.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road administration paid not only the cost of additional services, which were already necessary, such as securing the Dologne wall, but also those which would not have been necessary in the event of proper construction preparation.</seg>
<seg id="189">This includes expenditure resulting from disturbed construction processes (€3.2 million), additional work on the heading team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of the construction period (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million does not stand in the way of any lasting added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">The Brh took these and other measures to call on the Federal Ministry to make better use of the specialist inspectorate for major road-building operations.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, it should press for road construction administrations to introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Advantages of cooperation for Brh and NKDP The cooperation met the expectations of both auditors.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Brh received information on the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both audit offices developed a data set on bridge and tunnel prices, which will help in future audits.</seg>
<seg id="196">The NKDP found that the main construction parameters for D 8 bridges, tunnels and roadways are not different from those for A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of the two auditors involved in the cooperation gathered valuable experience, which will be useful in future audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of turnover tax in the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Preface</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the audit offices are empowered to examine the whole of public finances.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration requires the courts to have the power to examine tax collection as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The organisation of the European Supreme Audit Bodies (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thematic focus of VI. EuroSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, formed the audit of public revenue by the Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for auditing public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is particularly true of taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.</seg>
<seg id="9">As the national economies are increasingly interdependent and interdependent, there can be a situation in which the national audit offices can only carry out their audit activities in cooperation with the audit offices of other countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example can be the examination of internationally organized fraud, which can lead to significant losses of revenue in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Cooperation between authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Audit bodies in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea of examining turnover tax and the MIAS system is in the VI. EuroSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Court.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the course of thorough preparation, the auditors involved first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures for the management of turnover tax in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the basis of the analysis of the available information, we carried out the selection of subjects for examination planning.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving the efficient and effective management of turnover tax is a long-standing problem and individual Member States (particularly the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of turnover tax and create greater transparency in this area.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit can contribute not only to improving the work of the financial management, but also provide the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.</seg>

<seg id="24">The Commission's audit objective is:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The purpose of the examination in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial authorities in the field of turnover tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the single market in the European Community (hereinafter referred to).</seg>
<seg id="26">(De) The purpose of the investigation was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, focusing on mutual assistance in the field of turnover tax in accordance with the abovementioned Regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to remedy them.</seg>
<seg id="28">VAT information exchange system The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Court of Auditors (Brh) of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The main areas of cooperation were the review of selected business events between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international mutual assistance between tax administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the audits was drawn up in accordance with European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The period audited covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of the parallel examination</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audit of the turnover tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two audit offices.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of tax</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation with regard to international passenger transport by coach and bus and the comparison of statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">In comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were noted in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for the purposes of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among other things, the main criterion for registration is that the turnover threshold laid down in the turnover tax law is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, taxable persons receive only a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, for the purposes of turnover tax, the taxable person receives a tax number which applies only to domestic transactions.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German tax payer wishes to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called USt-IDNr.</seg>
<seg id="42">As problems arise as a result of the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International passenger transport by bus and coach.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, international passenger transport by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but the tax is deducted.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, as far as the route passes through Germany, the transport is subject to turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common turnover tax system (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic the tax authorities have to make VAT returns only for sub-annual tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany tax-payers (monthly or quarterly) are required to pay tax.</seg>
<seg id="49">Prior notification of turnover tax and an annual declaration of turnover tax after the end of the calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="50">In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany are required to make VAT pre-declarations electronically.</seg>
<seg id="51">The introduction of the VAT obligation in the Czech Republic would improve the effectiveness of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="52">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="53">While tax payers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary returns to the Finance Offices (FSI), German tax payers have to submit the summary returns to CLO2.</seg>
<seg id="54">Accordingly, in the Czech Republic, the data from the summary reports are available immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="55">The data from the summary reports are not available until they have been processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="56">In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is required as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="57">The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the updating of the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="58">This would allow a timely examination of taxation in the Member State of the purchaser (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same time limits.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information on turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German tax administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of the requests for information received within the prescribed time limit.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the German CLO has recommended continuous monitoring of the time limits (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">(6) Risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States must develop its own Risk Management System (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The NKDP and the Brh point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5. ).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, the two audit offices examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="69">Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using CLO's legal possibilities, in which there were doubts as to the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The Court found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the FSS used the information obtained during the international exchange of information and refixed the turnover tax liability of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="72">In such cases, the taxable persons had either wrongly used the exemption from turnover tax or did not include the purchase of goods in their declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the DGs were unable to make use of the information obtained during the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of differences in legislation in the two Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused the information requested.</seg>
<seg id="76">A number of cases have been identified where tax payers in their summary reports have shown that transactions are incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly erroneous, so that the administrators (the FSS) had to identify these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Examination PROCEDURE</seg>
<seg id="79">Verification procedures in CR</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - "State budget revenue" and the Territorial Audit Divisions of Central Bohemia, North Western Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The bodies examined were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FU Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaš, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokoloc</seg>
<seg id="82">The College of the NKDP approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Examination procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the audit area of transport taxes and staff of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase, the actual test began in 4. Quarter 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by the Brh and later by the NKDP, the Brh had to announce the examination in several Länder.</seg>
<seg id="88">Apart from interviews in the BMF and CLO, the examination was carried out in the following Länder:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files from the following FSS were included in the audit:</seg>
<seg id="91">Commission of the European Communities, Directorate-General for Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs, Directorate-General for Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs</seg>
<seg id="92">Discussions were also held with the French city of Augsburg, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, ice life, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">The results of the audit were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two audit offices</seg>
<seg id="95">In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both auditors took place.</seg>
<seg id="96">Participants at these meetings were familiar with the organisation of financial management, the legislation on turnover tax and the system of turnover tax management in each country.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject matter of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, a timetable for the follow-up procedure was drawn up and the following subjects were identified for the parallel tests: 1.</seg>
<seg id="100">Registration of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">International passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the action taken by financial officials in dealing with requests for information and in examining selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. Declaration and date for submission:</seg>

<seg id="118">An entrepreneur with a legal registered office, business office or establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 (1) on the first day of the third month.</seg>
<seg id="119">The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.</seg>
<seg id="120">Current legislation does not allow retroactive registration of a taxable person if he has exceeded the deadline for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, business place or establishment in the Czech Republic, who has a turnover tax or a turnover tax exemption requirement in 2004, does not have to obtain the right to deduct from the tax.</seg>
<seg id="122">An entrepreneur with a legal registered office, business office or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions laid down in the law may voluntarily apply for VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="123">On receipt of the application for registration by the local financial officer, the registration procedure under Law 337 / 1992 begins.</seg>
<seg id="124">Anyone wishing to register voluntarily for turnover tax must indicate in his application the date on which he requests registration as a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax officer shall examine the information supplied by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all the installations.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts as to the information provided, he shall ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="127">If the tax officer has verified that the entrepreneur fulfils the conditions for registration, he shall issue a written declaration on registration and the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="128">In the decision, the tax officer shall indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for turnover tax and the period of assessment for turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="129">The assessment period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached a minimum of CZK 10,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="130">If this is the case, the assessment period shall be the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">An entrepreneur whose turnover during the preceding calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 shall be entitled to choose the calendar month as the period of assessment and shall inform the tax officer of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The issue of a tax number in the registration certificate is always constitutional.</seg>
<seg id="133">The taxable person must indicate the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the tax officer, and in those cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law No 235 / 2004, concerning the issuing of tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the case of natural persons, this shall be the number of the instrument of birth or any other general identification mark, provided that a special law so provides. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the enterprise identification number (in accordance with Article 33 (12) of Law No 337 / 1992).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation, despite a request from the financial officer, the local financial officer must register it on his own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="137">This is also the subject of a notice which is sent to the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, each registered entrepreneur receives a tax number for any type of tax at the time of his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="139">This also applies to registration as a turnover tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to Law No 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, the tax officer may, in the event of failure to comply with the obligation to register turnover tax, require the taxable person to pay tax up to 10%.</seg>
<seg id="141">Payment of the amount thus fixed is considered to be a tax payment within the meaning of Article 98 (3) of Law No 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">If the legal conditions are met, registration of a turnover tax agent may be cancelled for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Deletion of registration at the request of the taxable person, i.e. mainly because turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (Article 106 (1) of Law No 235 / 2004).</seg>
<seg id="145">A taxable person may request the cancellation of his registration not later than one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Exemption of registration on its own initiative (Article 106 (7) of Law No 235 / 2004) if:</seg>
<seg id="147">A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State is not required to pay tax in accordance with the legislation of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="148">He must submit an application for registration to FA Prague 1 no later than the date of delivery in question.</seg>
<seg id="149">He shall be responsible, in this application, for all the USIDNr allocated to him in other Member States or third countries. Statement OF ACTIVE SUBSTANCE (S)</seg>
<seg id="150">If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration later than on the day on which the first taxable benefit was paid in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 was to be registered retroactively in accordance with Law 235 / 2004.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the case of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 is required to obtain proof of performance from the operators concerned (invoices or written explanations).</seg>
<seg id="152">If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic prior to the first performance of a service, FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the contract documents justifying the performance.</seg>
<seg id="153">At 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered at FA Prague 1, including 124 from Germany. At 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, including 233 from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">Under the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law No 235 / 2004, the tax officer is empowered to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept</seg>
<seg id="155">In the examination of the NKDP, it was found that in the case of the submission of a tax declaration by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for the submission of a tax declaration, this declaration has not</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of cancellation of registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur in the Czech Republic is no longer possible in the</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of taxable persons in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In accordance with the provisions of the Tax Order (§ 137, 138 AO), each business must be notified to the municipality and / or the competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">Such notification shall be made no later than one month after the commencement of the business.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality sends the notification to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the competent tax office finds that a business has been started but has not been notified, it may also register the taxable person on its own initiative retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">In Germany, irrespective of whether they are resident or non-resident, taxable persons are obliged to register for the purposes of turnover tax if they fulfil the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 of the German Law on turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the level of turnover achieved.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">Business starters resident abroad are responsible for specific R &amp; D activities.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those entrepreneurs who have their head office in the Czech Republic, the FA Chemnitz South is responsible.</seg>
<seg id="167">The total number of Czech entrepreneurs was 295 on 30 April 2004; on 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.</seg>
<seg id="168">According to the Brh, these FEMs, with special responsibilities, often refused to register so-called false self-employed persons domiciled in the new central and eastern European countries. Eastern European Member States of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since, after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, the free movement of workers is still restricted, these self-employed persons tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own businesses.</seg>
<seg id="170">These (temporary) self-employed do not fulfil the conditions laid down in § 2 of the UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they are usually dependent on a single contracting authority which determines their working hours and the nature of the work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the relevant FA and give details of the enterprise and the activity carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a form binding on all FEMs in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is handled either in special organisational units within the FSS or in the organization units generally responsible for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="174">With the aid of this form, a risk assessment shall be carried out for each taxable person prior to the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits are the identification number for the relevant FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur wishes to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a UST-IDNr in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is allocated by the CLO on application if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for turnover tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="179">The UST-IDNr. Is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxable person declares intra-Community deliveries in his prior declaration of turnover tax or in his annual declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="180">The UST-IDNr. Consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur may be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. when he ceases business), but only after all tax transactions have been settled (assessment of all financial years) or 2. If the financial management finds that he no longer operates a business.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a rule, the validity of the UST-IDNr is determined. The value of the turnover tax number depends on the validity of the turnover tax number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In such cases, the FOS must inform the CLO of the deletion of the turnover tax number in order to verify the validity of the UST-IDNr. President. - The next item is the report (Doc.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the Turnover Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxable persons are not required to pay any turnover tax in the following cases: 1.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they do not have to pay turnover tax, small entrepreneurs are obliged to register with the tax office and submit an annual declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small entrepreneur may explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration shall be binding for the following five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">He may then invoke the turnover tax and deduct the input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-resident tax payers may appoint a fiscal representative (Article 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The precondition for this is that they make only tax-free transactions and refrain from the deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The tax representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for the purposes of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices shall indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first condition for registration (among others) is that the threshold amount referred to in the turnover tax law is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="197">If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences may occur due to different organisational structures in the different Länder.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of registration for turnover tax, this tax number shall also apply to intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, an entrepreneur who can be registered for turnover tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German entrepreneur wishes to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically allocate a UST-IDNr. States.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both the NKDP and the Brh noted that the German dual-stage registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which can give a single identification number for both national registration and intra-Community turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxable person does not register with the municipality or the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration enables an accurate assessment of turnover tax for previous assessment periods, in particular a precise estimate of turnover tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">Since the different registration procedures cause problems, the rules for the Community as a whole should be harmonised.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament has recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.</seg>
<seg id="208">This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to each natural person after birth.</seg>
<seg id="209">This number shall apply throughout the life of natural persons resident in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person takes up a business, the competent FA shall apply for an industrial tax identification number called UST-IDNr. States.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the UST-IDNr. States.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on implementing an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International passenger transport by bus and coach</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">In accordance with the provisions of Article 70 of Law No 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempted from turnover tax and is entitled</seg>
<seg id="216">The exemption from turnover tax shall also apply where the carriage of persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or of foreigners resident in the territory of the country is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return journey is considered to be a separate transport operation.</seg>
<seg id="218">If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not engage in any economic activity other than the international carriage of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as being subject to turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="219">Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic was not exempted from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The text of the body referred to is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="220">'for the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may apply, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport,</seg>
<seg id="221">Legislation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as transposed in Germany by Article 3b (1) of the UStG, transport shall be carried out where the transport is effected.</seg>
<seg id="223">Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and international passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the domestic part of the transport operation is subject to taxation in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">Nor does German taxation distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxable person travels through Germany, the part of the transport in Germany shall be deemed to be taxable transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.</seg>
<seg id="228">The latter shall register him for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for each motor bus referred to in the declaration by the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="229">The entrepreneur must indicate his taxable transport services in a German declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="230">On 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered at the FA Chemnitz-South.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport service is provided to an entrepreneur resident in the country, the non-resident taxable person does not have to pay the turnover tax himself to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="232">In his place, the domestic purchaser of services is required to pay the turnover tax to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxable person. This operation is referred to as "relocation of the taxable person" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the notification by a non-resident taxable person and his income tax declaration, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax declaration as regards taxable passenger transport:</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile customs control groups shall check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad used for the carriage of passengers by Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each examination, the mobile control groups shall send an inspection protocol to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may ask the bus driver to pay the turnover tax before he continues his journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident taxable person may deduct the turnover tax thus paid from the tax liability specified in his declaration.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the FA has doubts as to the accuracy of a turnover tax declaration, it may order an examination to be carried out in the FA or may use the means of administrative assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the foreign taxable person refuses to pay the legally established turnover tax, the FA may request assistance under Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">The Court considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters in order to verify the declaration of turnover tax or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too expensive in relation to the small amount of tax on personal income.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the audit of the books of a non-resident taxable person causes disproportionate costs for the taxable person himself and for the financial management.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter must examine foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language but also of the foreign accounting principles.</seg>
<seg id="243">Accordingly, such an examination is likely to be more time-consuming than a resident taxpayer, although the audit is limited to passenger transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must not only accept the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States in so far as he carries out passenger transport there.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, for each Member State where only one passenger transport is carried out, the taxable person must comply with all the existing tax legislation in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the tax administrations of the EC Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="246">In this way, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation varies from one country to another.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from turnover tax under the Act on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, transport is subject to turnover tax according to the route on the German territory.</seg>
<seg id="251">If, for the first time, a non-resident taxable person provides such a transport service, he shall first notify it to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="252">The latter shall register the taxable person who must declare the taxable part of the transport in a tax declaration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Implementation in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three out of four Czech tax agents registered at the FA Chemnitz-South have passenger transport as their commercial purpose.</seg>
<seg id="255">The tax revenue in question is relatively low in relation to the administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States - which levy turnover tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common turnover tax system - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of VAT assessment, cross-border passenger transport should be subject to taxation only in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the State in which the transport commences or in which the provider is established.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.</seg>

<seg id="263">The tax is due when the time limit for the submission of the declaration of turnover tax has expired. In accordance with Law No 235 / 2004, the turnover tax on imports of goods is excluded from this scheme. In this case, the duty is determined in accordance with the customs rules.</seg>
<seg id="264">Where there is an entitlement to reimbursement as a result of higher than average deductible deductions, this amount shall be reimbursed to the taxable person within 30 days of the fixing of this deduction, without the need to draw up an application.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit shall not be applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure concerning the tax liability of the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with Article 73 (11) of Law No 235 / 2004, the right to deduct may be exercised at the latest by means of the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct.</seg>
<seg id="267">At the end of this period the deduction may be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period during which the application would have been possible for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this requires the submission of a supplementary declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="269">An amendment to Law No 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, permits the submission of a supplementary declaration of turnover tax only for the period during which the right to deduct could have been invoked for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">(A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability;</seg>
<seg id="271">A taxable person may make a supplementary declaration of turnover tax if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxable person must make the supplementary declaration by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.</seg>

<seg id="281">Within the framework of the ATIS system, a verification of the authenticity of the turnover tax returns is carried out by the FA.</seg>
<seg id="282">This is done automatically, since the declaration of turnover tax cannot be processed without the prior examination.</seg>

<seg id="287">Collection and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly pre-declarations of turnover tax and the annual declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those who are obliged to submit pre-declarations of turnover tax must nevertheless submit an annual declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small businesses which are not obliged to pay turnover tax must submit an annual declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="291">The tax payers are, in principle, obliged to pay the tax until the 10th day of the month following that in which the tax is due. On the day following the end of the calendar quarter in which the turnover tax is due, a prior declaration of turnover tax is made (Article 18 (2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the turnover tax liability in the previous year was more than €6,136, or if it is a newly created enterprise, the entrepreneur is required to submit monthly VAT pre-declarations by 10 days at the latest. This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxable person may also choose to submit monthly VAT pre-declarations if he has received a refund of more than €6,136 in the previous year (Section 18 (2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">If the annual turnover tax is not more than €512, no prior notification of turnover tax or declaration of turnover tax is required.</seg>
<seg id="295">A turnover tax due shall be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>

<seg id="299">In principle, VAT returns, including refunds, must be processed promptly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German Law on turnover tax allows for an extension of these (delivery or payment) periods (§ 18 (6) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">If it is granted, the advance declaration of turnover tax and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly declarations, a special advance shall be paid.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment shall be offset against the turnover tax liability recorded for the period prior to notification in December.</seg>
<seg id="304">If an error is detected, the entrepreneur will have to make a corrected advance declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no "complementary" declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the declaration of turnover tax to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect declaration of turnover tax but only the incorrect annual declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corrections to this turnover tax declaration to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxable person are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first turnover tax declaration was issued.</seg>
<seg id="308">At the end of this four-year period, a declaration of turnover tax may, as a general rule, be corrected only in cases of easy to reduce or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">The tax authorities are required to submit the pre-declarations of turnover tax by electronic means.</seg>
<seg id="310">FSAs may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual turnover tax return may be made either in paper form or on the Internet, with or without certifi cation.</seg>
<seg id="312">If the tax is paid without certifi cation, the taxable person must make the declaration in addition on paper and with his personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">In the absence of prior declarations or declarations of turnover tax, the tax administration is entitled to provide a rough estimate of the turnover obtained by the taxable person 6.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of late payment, the taxable person may be charged with a delay supplement (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).</seg>
<seg id="315">In an earlier examination, the Court found that the FOS often did not levy this delay supplement.</seg>
<seg id="316">In the case of late payment, the amount was fixed in a non-uniform and arbitrary manner.</seg>
<seg id="317">The delay supplement therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular when the annual turnover tax declaration is submitted.</seg>
<seg id="318">The form of the declaration of turnover tax contains separate lines for value data on intra-Community deliveries, or States.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions shall be indicated in a separate row of the declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="321">The declaration of turnover tax submitted on paper must be either scanned or recorded electronically by specially designated personnel.</seg>

<seg id="324">According to which all data are recorded electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a false selection is made on the basis of certain standards.</seg>
<seg id="325">The turnover tax returns thus selected must be checked by the competent administrator on the basis of the automatically produced audit notes (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration has to make only a rough estimate of the turnover tax liability, it still has to be as precise as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxable persons are required to submit their VAT returns not later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the taxable person's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, the taxable persons are required to submit their pre-declarations no later than 10 days after the end of either the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the level of their tax liability in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annual declaration of turnover tax must be made by 31 May of the following year at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to submit an annual turnover tax declaration has a number of advantages and disadvantages:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ At the end of the calendar year, the taxable person may correct the errors in the monthly advance declarations by submitting a single declaration of turnover tax;</seg>
<seg id="334">- if the taxable person corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM,</seg>
<seg id="335">- The Länder do not compile MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax agents until the annual declarations of turnover tax have normally been processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs are required to submit a declaration of turnover tax irrespective of the level of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This levy does not enable the German tax administration to verify compliance with the turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the relevant FA can compare the annual declaration of turnover tax with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the undertaking concerned.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only check the level of turnover on the basis of the return on income tax.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German tax payers are obliged to provide the pre-declaration of turnover tax electronically.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to provide the tax declaration electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the effectiveness of the Czech financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary noti cations</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">In accordance with the provisions of Article 102 of Law No 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who supplies goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State must submit summary declarations (hereinafter referred to as "the ZM").</seg>
<seg id="345">The value of the goods delivered is always expressed in Czech currency in the CCs, broken down according to the UST-IdN7, of the individual taxable persons under which they are registered in the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="346">Information on services is not provided in the CCs.</seg>
<seg id="347">The taxable persons with a calendar month or quarter period of taxation shall be taxed by the central banks not later than the 25th day of the month following that in which they are taxed. To be supplied to the local FA on the day following the end of each quarter.</seg>
<seg id="348">Incorrect data should be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of detection of the error.</seg>
<seg id="349">Erroneous data in the CCs are always replaced by the data from the Amending ZMs.</seg>
<seg id="350">In the same way as in the case of tax returns, the taxable persons may issue the ZM electronically.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a taxable person does not pay a ZM or Amending ZM, although it is obliged to do so under Law No 235 / 2004, the tax officer shall require him to pay the relevant ZM and to pay the tax. In the event of failure to comply with non-monetary obligations, the tax officer is empowered to impose fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Article 37 of Law No 337 / 1992.</seg>
<seg id="352">In its examination, the NKDP found that, in most cases, the FSIs did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="353">In the case of the ZM, in particular, the taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to pay a ZM did not affect the amount of their turnover tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">In accordance with Article 102 (5) of Law No 235 / 2004, the tax officer is obliged to verify the information contained in the CCs or amending CBs, to eliminate all ambiguities and to use the information for determining the tax.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the event of non-conformity</seg>
<seg id="356">8 of the information in the CCs with those provided by the tax agent corrects false information in the CCs by issuing a corrective ZM either on its own initiative or on request.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax officer shall correct the data relating to deliveries of goods to other Member States under the ATIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">- the taxable person does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or Amending ZM) and therefore corrects it by issuing a Amending ZM,</seg>
<seg id="359">- the tax officer has proved that the information reported by the taxable person in the ZM or Amending ZM has been incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="360">Where the tax officer has not issued an amending ZM by the taxable person, it is not the tax officer's obligation to provide the corrective ZAS that is correct.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from the CCs shall be forwarded to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of turnover tax may transmit and receive such data.</seg>
<seg id="363">This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is carried out by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of Turnover Tax in the Ministry of Finance). The "O _ MCTL" message receives the CLO automatically from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect USt-IDNr indicated in the transmitted ZM lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">Is the wrong UST-IDNr? In some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made to the list of false USt-IDNr.</seg>
<seg id="366">The list contains a "Statement of doubt on UST-IDNr."</seg>
<seg id="367">The financial officer shall verify the data and enter the result of the verification into the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of the acquisition of goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his declaration of turnover tax and record the value of the acquisition in the lines of the declaration of turnover tax intended for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of differences between the value of the acquisition made by the Czech tax agent in his declaration of turnover and the value declared by the supplier from the other Member State in its ZFA are forwarded to the CLO for verification.</seg>
<seg id="370">The clerks there must examine the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="371">There may then be three different situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">(A) the value indicated by the Czech purchaser under the relevant headings of his declaration of turnover tax is lower than the value of deliveries declared by suppliers from other EC Member States;</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the financial officer shall check that the information is correct.</seg>
<seg id="374">(B) the difference shall be zero.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation may be due either to a change in the data within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or to a change in the data in the turnover tax declaration (the Czech tax authority gives its own initiative).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is up to the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information contained in the declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="377">(C) the value of goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT declaration, is higher than the value of their deliveries of goods declared by suppliers from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here again, it is up to the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="379">After a review of the differences and an explanation of the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer shall enter the results of his review into ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">These results will be forwarded to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of transactions sent by CLO for examination for each quarter of 2005 is shown in Figure 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="382">Figure 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO to the FSS for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">The significant reduction in the number in the 4th One reason for this is that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for wrong selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for requests for information to the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">Discrepancies between the data in the turnover tax returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error of the domestic purchaser.</seg>
<seg id="385">There may also be an error by the taxable person in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the CCs are indicated differently in each EC Member State.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most frequently found reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions in the audited FOs are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary notifications in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs making intra-Community deliveries to other EC Member States or participating in triangular transactions must issue quarterly ZM listing intra-Community deliveries to purchasers (Article 18a (1)).</seg>
<seg id="389">The ZM must: The date of the month following the calendar quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="390">If a permanent extension is granted for the submission of pre-declarations of turnover tax, that extension shall also apply to the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="391">The ZMs are to be supplied to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="393">The competent FA may allow exemptions for individual tax packages in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">If the taxable person finds that the ZM was defective, he is obliged to make an adjustment ZM within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">If the ZM is not released, the CLO initiates an enforcing procedure.</seg>
<seg id="396">This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, accompanied by the threat of a penalty payment being imposed and - determination of the penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows for the fixing of a penalty of up to €25,000 (Article 329 AO), the CLO fixes penalty payments of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, Paragraph 26a (1) (5) of the UStG states that the taxable person does not act properly if he deliberately or faithfully delivers a ZM, or if he does not deliver it in good</seg>
<seg id="399">A fine of up to €5,000 may be imposed on this infringement.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the FOS because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="401">The data of the ZM are stored only at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="402">The data from the summary reports are only available to the DGs after processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The time limits for processing CRMs are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in MIAS).</seg>
<seg id="405">In case of incorrect UST-IDNr. In the ZM German tax payers, the German CLO receives a notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO then addresses the entrepreneur and requests the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be sent to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to them to ask for the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="409">In its audit, the Brh found that most entrepreneurs were UST-IDNr. At the request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the reminder, as well as the threat and fixing of up to three successive periodic penalty payments, takes too much time if a taxable person may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">The cases finally notified to the relevant DGs have usually been closed within one to two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The relevant FA refused to grant the tax exemption for declared intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.</seg>
<seg id="413">The tax payer put the right UST-IDNr. IAS asked him to submit an corrected ZM to CLO because the FEMs cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Brh found that neither the FSA nor the CLO controlled the submission of the corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="415">This is why the tax authorities have often failed to comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data on turnover tax declarations, no comparison of the data on goods delivered in the VAT or turnover tax declarations is made with the corresponding data in the CCs.</seg>
<seg id="416">This adjustment can only be made by the FEMs. This is usually done in the preparation of a special VAT audit.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data from other Member States are processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect UST-IDNr. Are recognised and notified to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data are used to control labour taxation in the FSS.</seg>
<seg id="420">As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with the data of previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control messages will be prepared and sent to the relevant DGs.</seg>
<seg id="422">This is done continuously, whereas a list of the activity data of all VAT persons will be produced later and sent to the FSS.</seg>
<seg id="423">The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares these data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">The system fully verifies (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for turnover tax in another Member State must supply a ZM to the local authority within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="427">The FEMs process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of intra-Community deliveries declared by taxable persons in the CCs are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries declared by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the adjustment shall be taken into account in the determination of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to supply quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.</seg>
<seg id="431">Since 1 January 2007, tax payers have been required to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="432">The CNEs are not available to CLO until they have been processed.</seg>
<seg id="433">In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the tax authorities in the CCs only indicate deliveries of goods.</seg>
<seg id="434">The provision of services is not indicated in the CCs. Unlike the Czech FSS, the German FSS cannot itself correct erroneous data in individual lines of the ZM supplied.</seg>
<seg id="435">Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect UST-IDNr was found. Even if the tax payer does not correct the correct USIDNr. Notified to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax authorities do not compare the figures for intra-Community deliveries made by German tax agents in their VAT pre-declarations with those of the corresponding ZM.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of the prior notification and the ZM are not regularly detected before the German CLO sends the MIAS data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">On the basis of these findings of the Brh, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="439">Data supplied by other Member States on the supply of goods to Czech taxable persons are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the purchase of goods declared by Czech taxable persons in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The Czech CLO makes the adjustment separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most serious cases of discrepancies are forwarded to the FSS for examination.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech Treasury, the German Treasury does not generally consider taxation of intraCommunity acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general check shall be carried out only in the case of taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of other taxable persons within the Community only if the RMS has produced a test notice or the taxable person has in any case been selected for an examination.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the FSS from clarifying the reasons for the differences that arise.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of turnover tax fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">Whereas, in order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as soon as possible;</seg>
<seg id="448">The current CZM system, in particular MIAS, provides the financial authorities with information which may well be half a year old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax authorities had to issue monthly ZMs.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly tax would significantly increase the bureaucratic burden as most of the tax payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are in any case required to submit monthly VAT returns or - pre-declarations, and are no longer required for VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid red tape, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the submission of VAT declarations or advance declarations.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, a requirement for the monthly supply of ZM would cause more periodical discrepancies between intra-Community deliveries and intra-Community purchases and would increase the flow of data between CLO.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the Federal Government requested the general introduction of monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="454">Implementation failed due to the concerns of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that a monthly transmission of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In order for the obligation to supply ZM monthly to be effective, it is necessary to agree at European level on the uniform monthly levy, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on deliveries and purchases of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In foreign trade, Germany is the main trading partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total turnover of intraCommunity trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both auditors requested data on the number of false tax numbers or UST-IDNr. In the O _ MCTL declarations exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the quarters examined.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data can be found in the tables below.</seg>
<seg id="462">They have significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL was reported.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information at stage 3</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information enables financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxable persons who have exported them.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of value added tax, which repeals Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (the previous Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003) distinguishes between:</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request shall take place by means of a request for information (Full Court). : Request for information RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Finance Officers in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their replies to a received RFI through the Financial Directorate to the CLO. This concerns the translation of the information given in the standardized SCAC form into the foreign language and the transmission to the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to sent requests. It is concerned about their translation into the Czech Republic and their distribution to the relevant DGs for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Art. (8) Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from the date of receipt of the request for processing.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period under review were examined by the NKDP.</seg>
<seg id="474">From the total of 94 of the RFI received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%), this period was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NKDP. More detailed information on the deadlines within which Germany's requests were answered by the Czech Republic is given in Figure 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">From the total of 335 requests for information (RFI) from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were received. No reply from Germany has yet been received to the examination by the NKDP (in the remaining one case it was not possible to establish when Germany responded to the request for information on the basis of the information given).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the time limits within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered is given in Figure 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of intra-Community turnover shown in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The above graph shows that most of the transactions audited in connection with requests for information were worth more than €60,000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="481">The tax authorities of other Member States are often provided with information, without prior request, which is important for the determination of the turnover tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The exchange of information between the various Member States shall be carried out electronically.</seg>
<seg id="484">"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of predetermined information to other Member States at regular, pre-established intervals without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="485">'structured automatic exchange 'means the systematic transmission of previously established information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States of deliveries of new vehicles during the automatic exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information shall be obtained by the tax officer from the form notifying the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Article 19 of Law No 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">In dealing with this form, the Financial Officer shall enter the required data into the relevant document document and forward it directly to the relevant staff of the Financial Directorate, where the data are collected and sent for further processing to the CLO. Thereafter, the data shall be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified time limit, not later than two months after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Czech Republic shall also forward to the other Member States information on transactions in mail order which are exempt from tax in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions which appear inadmissible and into potential missing traders.</seg>
<seg id="490">This information shall be transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form by means of a spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.</seg>
<seg id="493">The FSA sends the completed SCAC 2004 form by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which sends the SCACforms to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The FEMs are required to draw up their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACform used is in one language.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information examined by the Court were sent in order to ensure the taxation of employment in the other Member State or to demonstrate the tax freedom of intra-Community deliveries from Germany to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the supplies referred to in the request exceeds the minimum amount of €15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information on a turnover below the minimum amount limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO is concerned about the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in either English or German.</seg>
<seg id="499">To reply to the request for information, CLO sends it to the relevant FA, referring to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">No further time limits have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor the maintenance of timescales, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FSO of the response to the unfinished requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The FSS receives the information required by typing the tax agent or carrying out an external audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: The special turnover tax audit covering all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called turnover tax review, which may be carried out at the end of the year. Only a recent event.</seg>
<seg id="504">In this short and very exible form of examination, an announcement to the taxpayer is not necessary and it has proved its worth in investigating a single turnover.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany shall provide the other Member State with the following information: - via UST-IDNr, which have been allocated to undertakings established in other EC Member States,</seg>
<seg id="506">Germany has also undertaken to provide the other EC Member States with the following information as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:</seg>
<seg id="507">A. The supply of new vehicles to non-residents, b. Long-distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to turnover tax, c. It is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have a UST-IDNr. The applicant claims that the Court should:</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent in both the Czech Republic and Germany on the initiative of the local FSS, which send the SCACforms to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACforms (Czech-English) and translates information into the English or German language, the German FSO is following a request for information only.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not make translations of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">In examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany for the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKDP found that the Czech Treasury provided 74.5% of the received requests for information within the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO points to the three-month period, it does not monitor compliance with it.</seg>
<seg id="514">Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of late response requests.</seg>
<seg id="515">That is why the Brh has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has now changed.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the information available to us, the German CLO now reminds the financial offices of the answers to the outstanding requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">Turnover tax risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk Management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department for Methodology and Economic Management of Turnover Tax or its Risk Management Unit is concerned with identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates trends in these risks in national and intra-Community trade.</seg>
<seg id="523">At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares risk management in the field of turnover tax conceptually and cooperates with the competent EC institutions and the other Member States in this area.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Office for International Administrative Assistance in the field of Turnover Tax provides inter alia for the exchange of information, assists in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available under the MIAS system.</seg>

<seg id="528">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="529">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="530">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="531">The tax audit and tax collection department carries out, among other things, risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, lays down priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates for the selection of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Tax authorities are responsible for the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax agents and industries that are risky in terms of the hidden nature of tax evasion (e.g. Internet business, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for non-registered tax services, etc.</seg>
<seg id="533">Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected FECs.</seg>
<seg id="534">The latter have regional competence and carry out tax audits on the basis of authorization, even outside the local competence of the FSS.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up special audit units arose from the increase in established new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain transactions.</seg>
<seg id="536">These special units examine or concentrate on tax payers with certain activities, multinationals and tax payers with particularly high turnover, according to the needs of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for reducing risks in the field of turnover tax have been incorporated into the ATIS system:</seg>
<seg id="538">The task of "MIAS" may include: - verification of the validity of the UST-IDNr. - the value of the goods supplied to other Member States in return for tax returns, - the value of the goods supplied to other Member States, - the value of the goods in return for tax returns, - the value of any other Member State,</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of its task of combating tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land register, motor vehicle registers, business registers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in section 4.4.1. Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk Management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Because of their federal structure in the Federal Republic of Germany, both the Federal Financial Authorities (CLO in particular) and the Finance Authorities of the 16 Länder are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the federal Treasury fully have a single set of data.</seg>
<seg id="544">At CLO level, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as the "Kuss" coordinating unit for special turnover tax audits and tax evasion measures) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.</seg>
<seg id="545">In cooperation with the countries, another database called Zauber was set up at the Kuss. There, the financial offices can enter and interrogate the names of undiscovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="546">The Kuss coordinates both related cases of turnover tax fraud at national level and cases of cross-border turnover tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">Kuss's experience is brought into the development of the RMS through its cooperation in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, experts from several other organisational units of CLO and BMF are also involved.</seg>
<seg id="549">The formal review of the composition of UStIdN. Other Member States which appear in the German central bank tax offices shall be carried out by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal review is carried out prior to the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and hence its usefulness (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">Verification of validity in the so-called UST-IDNr. Is based on the O _ MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the correction of invalid UST-IDNr., see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the CLO RMS is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of messages to detect suspected missing traders. Certain characteristics, which usually occur in carousel shops, are used as reference points.</seg>
<seg id="553">The FEMs of the Länder are required to deal with these notifications and are required to forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.</seg>
<seg id="554">The examination by the Brh confirmed that all available characteristics must be included in order to deal with a case of tax fraud with sufficient probability (rather than focusing mainly on the turnover of an enterprise).</seg>
<seg id="555">Accordingly, the Brh has recommended that the BMF use combinations of indicators when compiling the messages.</seg>
<seg id="556">The risk management system should also take into account other factors, such as the payment behaviour of the taxable person, the economic sector or the company's participation conditions.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of risk management lies with the tax administrations of the Länder and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-declarations and annual declarations.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the system compiles a list of taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their declaration of turnover tax or annual declarations.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list shall be sent to the CLO in order to monitor the complete release of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions declared by the taxable person in his annual turnover tax declaration are compared with the data in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the Länder avoid comparing quarterly data as these would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="562">- the supplier and purchaser derive from different dates for the execution of intra-Community turnover,</seg>
<seg id="563">- different accounting records and tax declarations by Skonti and rebates.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing the data from the turnover tax returns with the MIAS data, many Länder have certain risk management mechanisms based on data from the turnover tax returns and certain other sources of age (e.g. age, age, age, age, age).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a fixed-rule risk management system allowing a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraud can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="566">This system is used in the processing of VAT returns by the FOS.</seg>
<seg id="567">As a result, the relevant FA receives the RMS's advice before the turnover tax is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers need to adapt the rules according to feedback from the FEMs.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on data from detected drowning cases.</seg>
<seg id="570">On the basis of these data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list, the competent NSIs shall decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, the auditors must report their results, so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.</seg>
<seg id="574">In North Rhine Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">On the basis of many data from processed VAT returns and some other evidence, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called datamining system) calculates how likely a tax fraud is to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">On the basis of this list, the DGs select the tax agents concerned for examination and report the audit results to the computer centre in question.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether the expected effects will occur in actual use.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKDP and the Brh have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Like the different approaches in the three German Länder mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud, in particular carousel fraud, has proved not to be a national problem but a European one.</seg>
<seg id="586">The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State but in several Member States.</seg>
<seg id="587">A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters seek the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="589">The tax evasion caused by Europe-wide fraud with regard to turnover tax does not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any other Member State involved in fraud may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected results from the examination of individual transactions In the context of the parallel tests, the NKDP and the Brh examined the quality and usefulness of information on selected deliveries and deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="593">The Czech Republic and Germany, which were the subject of an international exchange of information between the Treasury of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two audit offices jointly examined the handling of several deliveries whose performance was doubtful, or which the tax authorities of the two States stated differently in the tax declarations or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the Brh, the NKDP examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax agents.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, in 43 cases, the NKDP examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax agents had indicated in their tax declarations and ZM, on the basis of communications from the Commission.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the NKDP, the Brh verified a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="598">The relevant information was exchanged through CLO solely on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States give rise to the problems referred to in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax payer acquired €60.500 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech tax payer declared a purchase of only €29.869, the Czech Treasury sent a request for information to Germany to verify the value of the goods supplied.</seg>
<seg id="603">In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax agent concerned had contacted its Czech counterparty in the second quarter of 1997. €27.381 in the fourth quarter of 2004, €31.997 in the third quarter and €10.276 in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="604">It was also found from the reply that the UST-IDNr. He proposed that the Court should reply as follows: However, the German CLO had accepted another request by the German tax agent and the validity of the UST-IDNr. With effect from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German tax authorities corrected the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="607">By asking the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKDP found that in 2004 the Czech tax payer had at the same time submitted additional VAT returns for each of the other Member States (under-age) from the higher tax</seg>
<seg id="608">On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent administrative officer of the Czech Finance Office could not clearly determine whether, in the declared acquisitions, the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned goods could also be determined. German suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="609">In response to a request for information from the NKDP, the Brh found that the German supplier had been registered as a taxable turnover tax in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, when registering, he had not applied for the allocation of a US-IDNr, but only for a tax number valid exclusively for Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is not usually possible in Germany to provide a tax payer with a UST-IDNr retroactively. In 2006, the competent administrative officer of the German Treasury did so retroactively with effect from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO shares a UST-IDNr. If the German entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation, for example if the CLO decides to delay the delay at the request of the tax agent for the grant of a UST-IDNr. Adopted by the Commission on 8 December.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, CLO grants the UST-IDNr. Retroactive because, pursuant to Article 6 of the UStG, the contractor does not have a valid UST-IDNr for an intra-Community supply. Necessary.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the UST-IDNr (valid). He proposed that the Court should reply as follows:</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these procedural differences between Member States, the German CLO granted the UST-IDNr. In this particular case, retroactive.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech Finance Officer requested a review of the registration of the German entrepreneur on turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="618">From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, whereas a registration certificate issued by the local competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">The German authorities stated in their reply that the German tax agent had been registered on 1 October 2004 but had only a UST-IDNr in Germany on 16 February 2005 for organisational reasons. President. - The next item is the report (Doc.</seg>
<seg id="620">By asking the local Czech Finance Officer, the NKDP learned that the Finance Officer had carried out a VAT audit with the Czech tax agent for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="621">In the course of this examination, the tax office noted that, in its declaration of turnover tax, the Czech taxpayer had declared services worth CZK 9,897, which he had supplied to the German taxpayer before 1 October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="622">The (Czech) tax office fixed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 in relation to the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="623">On the basis of the request made by the NKDP, the Brh found that the German tax payer had the USt-IDNr. It was only when, on 16 February 2005, he notified the FA of his company set up in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the FA registered him retroactively as from 1 October 200415 for the purposes of turnover tax in order to be able to monitor the delivery of the turnover tax declaration for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this VAT declaration, the taxable person declared intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. 5,000 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In his return for turnover tax for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer declared the value of CZK 114,615 to a German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="627">When reviewing the registration of the German tax agent in the MIAS system, the Czech Finance Officer noted that this registration was valid only from 11 November 2004, following the deliveries of goods to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech tax payer issued a supplementary VAT return in which he paid turnover from domestic supplies worth CZK 114.615 and turnover tax amounting to CZK 21.777.</seg>
<seg id="629">In response to a request from the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKDP found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently applied to resume the taxation procedure in respect of the supplementary turnover tax declaration. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German tax payer had been registered since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Accordingly, the Czech Finance Officer verified the validity of the registration of the German tax agent in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">From the German information it appeared that a UST-IDNr was not available to the German tax agent until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods. President. - The next item is the report (Doc.</seg>
<seg id="632">As a result, the Czech Finance Officer rejected the request to resume the taxation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="633">The Brh found that, in this case, there had not been an intra-Community acquisition of goods because the German tax payer had not received a UST-IDNr until 11 November 2004. President. - The next item is the report (Doc.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German consignee declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the turnover tax and asked for the same amount to be reimbursed.</seg>
<seg id="635">Since this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German tax agent, the German tax officer did not correct the information in the turnover tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="636">Furthermore, the Brh found that the German taxpayer's company referred to in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in confusion between two German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German tax officer also confused the Czech Finance Officer.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German Finance Officer reviewed the acquisition of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax agent from a German tax agent of €22,686.</seg>
<seg id="640">In response to a request from the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKDI found that the Czech tax officer had been carrying out an external audit of the Czech tax payer and that the</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his declaration of turnover tax because the German supplier in the invoice did not declare his UST-IDNr. President. - The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id="642">According to the MIAS data, the German tax payer will not be registered for turnover tax in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech Finance Officer also requested that the German Finance Administration send a copy of the registration certificate issued by the German tax officer to enable him, where appropriate, to: A similar tax procedure could be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the acquisition of goods by a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose any turnover tax on the acquisition of the goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="645">The Brh found that under German law a taxable person supplying goods to other Member States did not supply UST-IDNr. In the case of intra-Community deliveries, in order to qualify for the exemption from turnover tax for such deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier only has to bear the UStIdN. Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,</seg>
<seg id="647">In this case, under German tax law, turnover is a (exempt) intra-Community supply which should be subject to labour taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech Finance Officer took note of this transaction because the supply of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community sales if they are below the minimum amount of €15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax payer acquired €12.561 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech Finance Officer carried out an audit for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">Within the framework of mutual administrative assistance, the Czech Treasury requested the verification of this delivery of goods by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech tax payer stated that he had never received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that the acquisition of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German Treasury rejected the request for the transmission of supporting documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was below €15,000 and no other justification was given.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech Finance Officer did not receive any documentation for a posteriori taxation of the goods purchased, the tax audit was unsuccessful and the original tax determination was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="656">On the basis of a request from the NKDP, the Brh found that the German tax payer acted as a "fiscal representative" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his declaration of turnover tax and in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to tax exemption has been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of the notification by the Brh, the German FA will send to the Czech Republic the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the goods purchased.</seg>
<seg id="660">In section 4.6.1 it has been shown that the responses of the German Treasury to requests for information exceed the three-month period more frequently than the responses of the Czech Treasury:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. In its audit, the NKDP noted that, on 5 October 2005, the Czech Treasury requested information on the value of the fourth financial year 2005. During the first quarter of 2004, Germany reported the first quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax payer had notified a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer for a value of €86,307, but the Czech tax payer declared the same value in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the reply to the request for information, which was sent to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the period laid down in art. According to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side informed it that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Since the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documentation for taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, a Czech tax officer requested, by means of a SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer in the third and fourth quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="666">The NKDP found that a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received at the time of its examination.</seg>
<seg id="667">By asking the local tax officer, the NKDP found that the Czech tax payer had not declared the supply of new vehicles to these German tax payers for the value of 11.8103.</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech Finance Officer corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax payer issued an corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="669">Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following the notification by the Brh, a special VAT examination was carried out at the German purchaser in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all the motor vehicles in question had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were further sold to other taxable persons in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax payer obtained in the 4th quarter. In the second quarter of 2004, a German tax payer paid a car worth €48,500.</seg>
<seg id="672">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="673">On request from the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKDP found that the Czech tax payer had no longer issued a VAT return since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Czech tax payer did not make tax returns even at the request of the tax officer. Consequently, on 23 May 2005, the FA fixed the turnover tax liability at zero for the period October to December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to check that delivery by the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="676">As the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the tax officer, he sent a request for information to Germany for the supply mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the response to the request for information was not received until 7 February 2007, it was not known how the Czech Financial Officer used the information obtained during the international exchange of information until the examination of the NKDP was completed.</seg>
<seg id="678">In view of the failure to comply with the provisions of the Czech VAT Law, the registration of turnover tax by the Czech tax agent was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only one partial response was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKDP and the Brh, the relevant FA had not yet completed the external audit:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech Finance Officer requested, by means of a SCAC form, a review of the delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004, with a value of €16,991,</seg>
<seg id="682">In its reply to the request for information, the German Finance Officer stated that he had only the invoices for deliveries of €16,335 issued by the Czech tax officer.</seg>
<seg id="683">On the basis of the request made by the NKDP, the Brh found that the external examination carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the purchaser in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German purchaser declared that the purchase of goods worth €16,335 was double in his VAT pre-declarations for August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, a Czech fiscal officer requested a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles made in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 to a German tax payer by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax authorities sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic confirming that the German tax payer had acquired several motor vehicles and that the investigation had not yet been completed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="687">The NKDP found that the local FA had carried out several external audits with the Czech tax operator in order to check the deduction of higher than average advance taxes.</seg>
<seg id="688">However, an unjustified claim has not been established.</seg>
<seg id="689">The Brh found that, for the period in question, the German tax payer had declared in his VAT returns that goods from other Member States had been purchased for the total value of €579,114 and that the examination of the German</seg>
<seg id="690">Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for disagreement between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's declaration of turnover tax and the information contained in the supplier's ZM.</seg>
<seg id="691">In the cases examined, it appeared that periodic disagreements or the incorrect declaration of turnover as intra-Community deliveries of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to the MIAS data, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth €35 716 from the German taxpayer, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare this purchase.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the tax officer and did not carry out any business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax officer had asked to communicate to the German tax officer for verification as part of the international exchange.</seg>
<seg id="695">The German reply to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax agent was unknown at the address indicated and the goods were collected by an agreed freight forwarder.</seg>
<seg id="696">The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax payer supplied only €21.659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech tax payer sent the German tax payer a false payment acknowledgement of the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">Following the discovery of the Czech purchaser's fraudulent behaviour, the German taxpayer, with the assistance of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the material supplied, with the exception of part of the value of €7 916.</seg>
<seg id="699">In response to a request from the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKDP found that, on the basis of the information received to the Czech tax agent, the financial management carried out, among other things, the turnover tax on</seg>
<seg id="700">On the basis of a request from the NKDP, the Brh confirmed that, after corrections, the German supplier had only notified a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer at a value of €7,916.</seg>
<seg id="701">In accordance with German legislation, the German tax authorities declared that the supply was returned and that the tax base was reduced in the quarter of the return.</seg>
<seg id="702">His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax operator:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">As part of the international exchange of information, the German Treasury requested the verification of the delivery of goods and services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCACform.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech tax payer had supplied to the German tax payer goods for the total value of €396,126 and provided services for the value of €11,885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The NKDP noted that the Czech Treasury had carried out an audit with the Czech tax agent in order to investigate this supply.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the request for information, the Czech Treasury stated that the Czech tax payer had supplied and assembled a production plant to the German.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech tax payer supplied the individual parts of the production plant prior to the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German tax payer did not reduce the installed production plant and claimed deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax payer calculated the German production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German tax payer received the returns, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">On request from the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKDI found that all invoices had been properly entered in the accounts of the Czech tax agent.</seg>
<seg id="713">The turnover tax returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only the amounts documented by the Czech tax agent and related to invoices invoiced after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The Brh found that, on the basis of the reply from the Czech Treasury, the local FA concluded that these transactions constituted a single (goods) delivery of the German tax payer, including the German tax payer, to the</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called work delivery is the place where the production plant is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German beneficiary of the works delivery owes the turnover tax in accordance with the German turnover tax law.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the beneficiary may claim the same amount of deduction.</seg>
<seg id="718">Since the control of turnover by the German tax agent remained unchanged, the German FA did not correct the declaration of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax payer A acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax payer C in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech Finance Officer addressed a request for a review of this information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer C had supplied this machine to the Czech tax payer B in 2004, but that it had returned it to the German tax payer B in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the German tax administration, the machine was not returned to Germany but was transported to the establishment of the German tax company C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">On the basis of the reply to the request for information, it was found that the German taxpayer C had supplied the machine to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">He received the machine at the headquarters of the establishment of the German tax agent in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since this supply (from C to A) was made only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">By asking the local tax officer responsible for the tax pic B, the NKDP found that, according to the MIAS data, the German tax pic C had supplied a value of €8 in the third quarter of 2004 (</seg>
<seg id="727">The tax agent B stated that he did not receive the goods so that the local Czech Finance Officer sent a request for information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">The answer was that the machine had been delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">In the course of further investigations carried out by the tax agent B, the tax officer found that the machine for the value of €88,027 had not been charged to the tax agent B, and that it had</seg>
<seg id="730">The NKDP also noted that the local Czech Finance Officer responsible for the tax agent A had carried out an audit with the latter.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax officer had the invoice of the German tax agent C of 7 February 2005 indicating the tax agent A as the recipient of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech Finance Officer noted that the taxable person A had not recorded this invoice.</seg>
<seg id="733">The taxable person A had concluded a lease contract with another Czech company, the object of which was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company supplied the machine on 9 February 2005 and also took care of transport.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech FA did not use the information given in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxable person A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The Brh found that the German taxpayer C did not supply the machine to the Czech Republic for the value of €88.027, but to another German taxpayer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">Accordingly, there was no intra-Community supply of goods, but rather a taxable supply within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">Consequently, the German tax officer did not recognise the right of the German tax agent C to exemption from turnover tax and corrected the information contained in his declaration.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German tax operator D supplied the machine to the Czech tax operator B.</seg>
<seg id="740">Under German law, this supply was not subject to taxation in Germany, but was subject to turnover tax in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">The Brh also noted that the German taxpayer C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 that a machine worth €58,000 had been delivered to the Czech taxpayer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This supply was not verified in the tax audit carried out by the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following graph shows the contractual relations between the counterparties involved in the above transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">In examining requests for information received, the NKDP found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech Treasury had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German tax officer received a check on intraCommunity deliveries of a German tax.</seg>
<seg id="746">The German Finance Officer stated that there was a suspicion that this was an objective intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The German tax payer has not been active since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The NKDP noted that the Czech Finance Officer had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="749">The head of the Czech company stated that it was probably a claim by the German tax agent to the German tax administration, which the Czech tax operator claimed as a shareholder in the German company.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information given to the NKDP, the Czech Finance Officer has so far not been informed that the German Finance Administration is dealing with the case with regard to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="751">The information available shows that this was not a merchandise shipment; however, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community shipment of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for these inconsistencies was the failure to indicate intra-Community acquisitions in the tax returns of the recipients (see above). Section 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer supplied a Czech tax payer for a total value of €33.205 for the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="754">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech Finance Officer asked for a check on the delivery of goods from Germany in the context of the exchange of information between Member States.</seg>
<seg id="756">In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had sent some of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the other goods had collected them personally.</seg>
<seg id="757">On request from the local Czech Financial Officer, the NKDP found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary turnover tax declaration for the period concerned before receiving a reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="758">Nevertheless, the differences in the value of the acquisition could not be clarified, so that the Czech Finance Officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="759">This examination has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer had supplied goods worth €46 854 to a Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, a Czech tax payer declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only €14.856.</seg>
<seg id="762">As part of the exchange of information between Member States, the Czech Financial Officer requested verification of the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="763">The German answer to this question provided three invoices showing a total value of the goods supplied of €31.999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and</seg>
<seg id="764">In response to a request from the local Czech Finance Officer, the NKDP found that, after receiving the reply from Germany, it wanted to contact the accountant of the Czech tax payer for a supplementary period of time, and</seg>
<seg id="765">To date no additional declaration of turnover tax has been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech Finance Officer informed the NKDP that he would act in such a way as to maintain the time limits for retroactive VAT determination for the tax period in question.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax payer supplied €11 600 to the German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="769">In the context of the exchange of information between Member States, the German Finance Officer asked for a check to be made on whether there were in fact the Czech tax-payers, since the alleged capital owner of the German tax-payer</seg>
<seg id="770">In the context of the review of the transaction by FA, the Czech tax agent confirmed the acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">However, according to the Czech tax payer, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were re-sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech tax payer provided evidence for the sale in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech taxpayer was not registered as a turnover tax in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the product in question in either the Czech Republic or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech Finance Officer provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German Finance Administration.</seg>
<seg id="775">In response to a request from the local Czech Finance Officer, the NKDP stated that the Czech tax payer had at the same time acquired a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which, inter alia, the</seg>
<seg id="776">In his Czech declaration of turnover tax, he did not report any turnover tax on the sale of goods in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="777">On the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration issued after the external audit, the Czech Finance Officer fixed the VAT debt unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">Under the Czech legislation, there was no acquisition of goods from other Member States since the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">As a result, the Czech Financial Officer has drawn a wrong conclusion in the external audit.</seg>
<seg id="780">The Brh found that the German tax officer immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information stating that the goods had not left Germany, corrected the German tax return of €1 600 in the value of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent FA sent a control message to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods in order to ensure that the resale of those goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, contractors declared intra-Community deliveries which could not have been carried out:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax officer received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech tax payer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The request for information was accompanied by an annex to the VAT registration certificate issued by the Czech tax agent.</seg>
<seg id="786">A photocopy of the passport was also attached to the person who should have transferred the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="787">In the course of his investigation, the Czech Finance Officer found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named had not introduced a vehicle into the Czech Republic and that it had no contact with a German tax passport.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, the copy of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="789">With this information, the Czech Financial Officer replied to the request for information and, at the same time, stated that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car.</seg>
<seg id="790">On request from the local Czech Finance Officer, the NKDP found that the Czech tax agent did not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the company's manager is not attainable.</seg>
<seg id="791">Following an appeal procedure for the tax period February 2005, the Czech tax officer set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at zero.</seg>
<seg id="792">In the course of a further investigation, the Czech Finance Officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had acquired it on the basis of an INTERNET DISPLAY.</seg>
<seg id="793">The Brh found that the local German tax officer had refused the German tax officer's right to exemption from turnover tax on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT declaration and the declared value from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="795">A Czech tax payer should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not comply with the MIAS data, the German Finance Officer requested the verification and payment of deliveries in the context of the exchange of information between Member States.</seg>
<seg id="797">In its reply to the request for information, the Czech Financial Officer stated that the Czech company's sole manager had been deleted from the Trade Register on 8 July 2005 and that a new manager had not yet been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was allegedly a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech tax payer issued a turnover tax declaration and a ZM, which had been signed by a person not authorized to do so, namely that company's shareholder, following the deletion of the manager in the commercial register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accounting officer of the Czech tax agent informed the tax officer that the capital owner had paid in euro the payment received for the invoiced goods to the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash vouchers have not been issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">By asking the local Czech FA, the NKDP found that the tax officer recognised the Czech tax payer's entitlement to VAT exemption in the first quarter of 2004 for deliveries of goods to other Member States in the first quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Brh found that the German tax officer did not correct the German purchaser's declaration of turnover tax since, in the meantime, a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax agent.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the previous external audit did not reveal any evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect that a fixed turnover tax liability would actually be charged.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to the MIAS data, in 2005 a German tax payer acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196, according to which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">The German taxpayer declared the intra-Community acquisition neither in his declaration of turnover tax in 2004 nor in that for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, it did not declare equivalent output sales in value terms.</seg>
<seg id="808">In view of these inconsistencies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the 4th Directive. The first quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2005. Quarter 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">In the CCs for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods for the total value of CZK 167.246.083.</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received in which the German side asked to examine whether the delivery notified by the Czech tax agent had actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In reply to this request for information, the Czech Treasury stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company had no manager (or other legal representative).</seg>
<seg id="812">The documents sent to the NKD by the relevant financial officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax agent, on 30 March 2006, a protocol on the start of the turnover tax audit for the fourth quarter of 2006. 2004 and the period January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">The tax officer was also asked by the tax officer to provide all accounting and fiscal documents for this period, but failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Trade Register, the term of office of the single manager expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new manager.</seg>
<seg id="815">The Czech tax payer no longer issued turnover tax returns since April 2006.</seg>
<seg id="816">During the parallel examination, the NKDP, in cooperation with the Brh, examined several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two auditors exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the relevant FA (Chemnitz-South) that it wanted to conduct tax-related business in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">On the basis of this information, the company was registered from June 2005 but did not receive German UST-IDNr.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (UCR) accepted a contract from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, on the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.</seg>
<seg id="821">Because of insufficient own production capacity, the Danish company transferred part of the contract to a German tax agent (UDE) operating in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport path of the wind turbines:</seg>
<seg id="823">Under German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="824">- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines in its name, to its risk and for its own account for assembly to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Because of its assembly, its supply takes place in Austria, i.e. the supply of wind turbines is controllable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">- When the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter carried out the transport in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the German subcontractor (UDE) was</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind power plants were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in one EC Member State (CR), the supply of the German Sub-Sub-Subcontractor could not be claimed.</seg>
<seg id="828">Accordingly, this supply is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where transport began.</seg>
<seg id="830">However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">- The supply of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">- The supply of the remaining wind turbines produced in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The Brh found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax declarations or in its ZM issued to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The NKDP found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation would be necessary between at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although there is no evidence of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the NKDP and the bar cases examined in order to show the size of the differences caused by the different 2004 legislation between the data in the turnover tax declarations and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audited cases also show that it takes some time for the tax authorities and the FOs to apply the new legal provisions:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax payer reported a total value of CZK 792,97,452 to a German tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-Community deliveries in his ZM to another German taxpayer for the total value of CZK 18.157.265.</seg>
<seg id="842">On the basis of the information provided by the Brh to the NKDP, it was found that both were electricity supplies.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech tax authorities took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No 235 / 2004 in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">In a further examination of these transactions, a NKDP audit group found that, in 2004, there were different legal provisions on the supply or purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic the tax authorities are responsible for the supply of electricity in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 as intra-Community deliveries of goods, according to the German legislation in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods, but a taxable and taxable transaction in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The differences in legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635 / 2004, which amended some fiscal provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. In the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the Commission, it was further established that, in the first and fourth quarters of 2005, a Czech tax payer received an intraCommunity tax in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="848">Information provided by the Brh to the NKDP showed that both were supplies of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">In accordance with the wording of Law No 235 / 2004 applicable from 1 January 2005, in the case of the supply of electricity, the place of performance shall be the place where the acquirer has its registered office, place of business or establishment.</seg>
<seg id="850">That is why the Czech tax authorities should not have declared electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both parties treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZMs as intra-Community deliveries resulted in a difference in value of CZK 503.881.939 in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the Brh and the NKDP.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both auditors gained deeper knowledge of the systems of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">Cooperation revealed differences between the two systems and the legal provisions governing the administration of turnover taxes.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions were found.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them deserve further observation.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit results, both auditors prepared recommendations on the management of turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="859">Follow-up to these recommendations in the form of a control audit should be part of further observation.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of both auditors is the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the field of turnover tax management.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement of construction services and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report by the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKDP) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (Brh) on their parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both to the State and to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the responsibility of the State to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important element in the creation of a single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities are required to comply with EU standards in their procurement operations above certain value limits (thresholds).</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, EU Member States have to transpose and apply EU procurement law into national law.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already been done in both the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Below the EU thresholds, it is left to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The award of services is also an area that is at risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="12">In view of the generally high potential for damage, contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and unacceptable benefits in the award of their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKDP) and the Federal Accounting Court of the Federal Republic of Germany (Brh) agreed to carry out parallel audits on both the EU-wide award.</seg>
<seg id="14">The audits focused on the application of the EU procurement law, which was transposed into national legislation, as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in building, road and transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">Commitments below the EU thresholds have also been included in the consideration with regard to corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit results of both auditors are summarised in this Joint Report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report should also be addressed to international bodies such as: For example, to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="18">Audit areas and audited bodies The assessments carried out by the Federal Audit Court on the topics listed are mainly based on cross-sectional audits carried out by the Federal Government in 2011 / 2012 with the federal authorities responsible for road construction and construction.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Committee examined, for example: For example, the construction of motorways and major building projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors drew on results from previous investigations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Czech Supreme Audit Office based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011. The audits included road, rail, water, hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc., as well as other building areas in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the majority of public procurement is carried out by the public works administrations of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for lending in the field of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the building sector, transfers are carried out decentrally by the authorities which use government budgets.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, freelance workers are also involved in subsectors of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="26">When comparing the evaluations, account must be taken of differences in the law on procurement and in the market structure for the construction services of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of the law on procurement in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to the national domain are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules governing them.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, for both EU-wide and national assignments, many complementary individual regulations are provided for by internal administrative rules.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such as the so-called "treatment books" of the Federal Republic, in which the legal provisions are supplemented or further elaborated in accordance with the jurisprudence of the law governing the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed solely by the procurement law and the other legal provisions applicable to both the above and below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new regulation increased transparency in the use of public funds, increased competition and limited the possibility of corruption in the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Main features of the law on procurement in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, in particular, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure are used for EU-wide assignments.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, measures below the EU threshold apply the national tendering procedures (public tendering, restricted tendering, voluntary tendering) which, however, largely correspond to the above-mentioned EU-wide tendering procedures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of primacy of open procedure (in the case of contracts to be awarded throughout the EU) and public tendering (in the case of national contracts).</seg>
<seg id="39">In the open procedure and in the public tender procedure, any interested company may submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another essential feature of German procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is done mainly by dividing an overall construction measure into skilled and semi-skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="42">The purpose of the individual award of these lots is to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both of the above characteristics of the German Procurement Law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.</seg>
<seg id="44">Germany has more than 330.000 construction enterprises with 1.9 million persons employed.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide award procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">One exception is the simplified procedure whereby a less strict procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with EU law, Czech procurement law provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current legislation in the Czech Republic allows the contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Czech Republic there are over 85,000 construction enterprises, some 1,900 of which have 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Construction volume of contracting entities and shares of types of tendering in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In Germany, the total volume of construction in 2011 was EUR 307 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of this, EUR 45.5 billion went to public construction (15%), including, in addition to federal construction, the construction activities of the Länder and municipalities in particular.</seg>
<seg id="53">The Federal Government's construction of building and trunk roads (excluding rail and waterways) amounted to EUR 8.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="54">The volume of contracts awarded for building and trunk construction in the Federal Republic in 2011 was as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public procurement, 12.7% open procedures and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="55">Of these, 33.2% were European-wide assignments.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 4.7 billion in 2011, which represented about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, the volume was 7.8 billion euro, which represented 37% of the total volume of construction.</seg>
<seg id="58">Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contract volumes below threshold 2.7% other procedures</seg>
<seg id="59">The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public procurement agencies in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The above-mentioned a. Data show that the parallel audits carried out by both countries focus on a significant proportion of public contracts, which are of major financial importance in preventing corruption in all contracts, and which, in the award of contracts, are open to the public.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of results of parallel tests</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKDP) and the Federal Audit Court of the Federal Republic of Germany (Brh) carried out parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and prevention.</seg>
<seg id="63">The working groups of the two audit offices compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the building and road construction sectors.</seg>
<seg id="64">They noted, in essence, that:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Directives on the awarding of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (para. 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the EU provisions, corruption prevention also includes the procurement rules of both countries, which differ in part in their priorities and in their detail (point 3.2).</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, an essential requirement of the tender documents is that they should contain all the information necessary for the proper submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The descriptions must be neutral and must not contain any restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Germany, the tender documents have largely met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, it remains a problem to determine the subject matter of the contract adequately.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, as far as possible, construction services should be divided into lots in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the Brh, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">In its audits, in particular in the field of road construction, the NKDP found that the award of large services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Restrictions on market potential may result in substantial increases in costs and present the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">In accordance with the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, in principle agree with the undertakings already authorized to provide additional or amended services which may prove necessary once the original contract has been concluded (4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective procedures for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">Under the legislation of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary prerogatives of the open procedure apply to EU-wide contracts or public tenders, which correspond to the open procedure in the case of national contracts.</seg>
<seg id="79">This will allow more companies to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price agreements between tenderers more difficult and leads to the most economic results.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of construction projects whose estimated total order values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations basically provided construction services throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct estimation of the estimated value of the contract is an essential basis for the choice of the correct type of award.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, cost data banks are used for the cost analysis of public works, particularly in the building sector.</seg>
<seg id="84">The results of the evaluation are based on the results of the work carried out on the basis of the results of the work carried out on the basis of the results of the work carried out.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">In the case of construction services to be supplied throughout Europe, advance information and notices must be published. This is designed to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to adapt to the planned commitments at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="87">The audited construction administrations generally adhered to this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may impair competition (point 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">According to EU law, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be made known beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to the EU's requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should, as often as possible, change between the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.</seg>
<seg id="93">In order to deal with the risk of manipulation, there are some very detailed requirements in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="94">The audited administrations did not take these requirements into account in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, during the supply phase, in the interests of fair competition, it is necessary to ensure that the same information is provided to undertakings interested in submitting tenders.</seg>
<seg id="97">Whereas contact between these undertakings and professionals involved in the preparation of the specifications should be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements;</seg>
<seg id="98">The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, some of the audited construction administrations in Germany did not comply with these requirements (4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the opening-up of tenders must take particular account of the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="101">The requirements for the identification, documentation, preservation and confidentiality of tenders are intended to narrow the scope for manipulation and are laid down in particular detail in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">The examinations in both countries revealed few complaints (4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">The examination and evaluation of tenders is laid down in both countries in terms of setting up and running organisation.</seg>
<seg id="104">The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been fully respected by the tendering authorities audited.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, tenderers sent tenders for examination to third parties without having to read the tenders beforehand and with sufficient documentation.</seg>
<seg id="106">The tender was therefore insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">When the EU-wide award procedures are concluded, the parties to the competition will be informed of the intention to order prior to the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="108">This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="109">The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review for non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to comply with the deadlines set for the award of contracts, or did they depend on the content of the tenderers' tender (point 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or understandable in the audited construction administrations in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In this respect, the EU-wide transparency offer was not sufficiently implemented in the notification of certain procedures.</seg>
<seg id="113">Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the corruptionpreventative role of documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Their reporting and reporting obligations were largely met by the contracting authorities in both countries (No 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Principles of EU procurement law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">EU Procurement Law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with regard to free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the procurement coordination directive and the appeal directive, which had been transposed</seg>
<seg id="118">The general principles governing the award of contracts in the European Union are, in particular, the offer of competition, the offer of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination and the offer of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">In order to achieve these objectives, the procurement coordination directive lays down special rules for construction services to be provided throughout the EU for construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="120">To this end, their estimated amount of orders must reach or exceed EUR 5,000,000 at present.</seg>
<seg id="121">The rules relate in particular to the content of the tender documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the deadlines for receipt of tenders, documentation of the tendering procedure, the requirements for the qualification of candidates,</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of possible infringements of the procurement law, the undertakings concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities verified by means of review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">Importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">In both countries there is no legal definition of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for the private benefit of:</seg>
<seg id="128">The i.d. R. The beneficiaries of these decisions.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic performance.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the European Union as a whole, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">In doing so, they must review the setting-up and development organisation of their administrations in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption there.</seg>
<seg id="135">Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making to corrupt abuse.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of public works is generally considered to be a particularly corrupt area of work.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption - particularly bribery and bribery, acceptance and authorisation of benefits - is persecuted under criminal law and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="139">In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has adopted a directive and recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration. In addition to risk analysis, priority must be given to public invitations to tender and open procedures, multi-faceted principle and transparency, the principle of separation of planning, award and settlement procedures, accuracy and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the procurement rules.</seg>
<seg id="141">For example, an electronic control system was introduced in 2011 by the Federal Ministry for Procurement in the Federal Railways Sector.</seg>
<seg id="142">If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. B. The estimated costs and amounts of orders, as well as information on the professionals involved, should be collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is also persecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment for tenderers and the prohibition of any discrimination are the main foundations of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">For public procurement, the Czech Government has established anti-corruption measures in a anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and has updated it for the years 2013 to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national procurement law and regulations. 14</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation essentially contains the following provisions: Reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation to prior publication of contracts by the contracting authority, including the indication of the reasons for the tender, prohibition of the restriction of the number of tenderers</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of the examination of the various stages of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Contract documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Tender documents The tender documents shall contain all information required by tenderers for the proper submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the tender documents must enable an accurate calculation to be made.</seg>
<seg id="152">No risks may be transferred to tenderers which cannot be calculated for them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The tender documents shall consist in particular of the description of the service and the terms and conditions of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="154">They also set out the requirements for the qualification (suitability) of tenderers and the criteria governing the selection of the most economic tender.</seg>
<seg id="155">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="156">The requirements of EU law relating to the tender documents relate in particular to technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="157">These must be equally accessible to all tenderers and should restrict competition as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="158">The description of performance must, in principle, be product-neutral.</seg>
<seg id="159">Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.</seg>
<seg id="160">The avoidance of restrictions on competition in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition, it is necessary to avoid unclear or incorrect information in the tender documents, since they provide scope for speculation in the preparation of tenders and for manipulation in their evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="162">Regulations of German and Czech Procurement Law</seg>
<seg id="163">The same or similar rules in both countries have been transposed into national law into EU legislation on technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="164">Benefits must, in principle, be declared product-neutral without a production specification.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the performance descriptions, the individual benefits must, as a rule, be subdivided in detail into performance units with respective quantities.</seg>
<seg id="166">In this case, prices should be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases can benefits be defined by functional targets.</seg>
<seg id="168">In any case, the performance descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain precise quantities and must not include benefits which do not determine whether they are needed.</seg>
<seg id="170">Allowances on a flat-rate basis or on the basis of time shall be avoided as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">The purpose of these provisions is to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified requirements in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The specifications must enable tenderers to prepare their tenders safely and without major preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender will not be published until the tender documents have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="175">There is no obligation to tender construction services in Losen in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="176">If it is possible according to the type of service to be carried out, the contracting authorities may subdivide works into several lots.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, construction services are in principle divided into lots, broken down by quantity (partial) and / or by type or subject area (specialist).</seg>
<seg id="178">The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in competition, to increase the number of potential suppliers and to make price agreements more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is considered to be the most economic in general.</seg>
<seg id="180">Evaluation criteria must be included in the procurement documents in the Czech Republic, both for EU-wide and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This is intended to give full and final recognition to candidates according to which criteria their tenders are to be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the disclosure of assessment criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is required only in the EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="183">In the case of national award procedures, the evaluation criteria shall be recorded only in an internal administrative notice.</seg>
<seg id="184">In Germany, tendering documents drawn up by freelance agents may not contain references to these offices or planners or evaluators involved in building and some road construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="185">The aim is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other inadmissible competitive advantages without the contracting authority's knowledge of their contact with these professionals.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why professionals are not allowed to send tender documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="187">The business contact is the contracting authority alone.</seg>
<seg id="188">There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additional or modified services which may prove necessary after the initial contract has been concluded (supplementary contracts) are almost always available in the case of large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="190">In both countries, the legal provisions make it possible to a certain extent to award supplementary contracts to the company already authorised without having to carry out a public contract award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">According to the EU rules and the German rules, the remuneration of supplementary benefits may not exceed half of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional benefits must not be separated from the main contract without any significant disadvantages or must be strictly necessary.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% for an award without public notice.</seg>
<seg id="194">As a result, however, it may be possible to increase: The risk of delayed completion of the project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the work already under way.</seg>
<seg id="195">Where supplementary services are also transferred to the undertaking already authorized, an arbitrary increase in the price of such services by the contractor is not, in principle, possible under the German regulations.</seg>
<seg id="196">On the contrary, the determination of the remuneration for the additional services must be based on the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the contract already awarded.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to supplementary benefits, there may also be a reduction in the amount of benefits.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary benefits.</seg>
<seg id="199">Main findings of the audit</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, the descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards which had already been replaced by European standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">Some of the performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications - for example, for deep dirt, joint strips or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, performance requirements were defined in such a way that only one product was eligible.</seg>
<seg id="205">List of benefits broken down by sub-services</seg>
<seg id="206">The Court has not, in any of the cases examined, found infringement of the obligation to prescribe benefits in principle in a list of benefits broken down by partial benefits.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of the descriptions</seg>
<seg id="208">In the vast majority of cases, the tender documents were completed before the start of the call for proposals.</seg>
<seg id="209">In some procedures, the tender documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.</seg>
<seg id="210">In some cases, the service directories contained items where it was not established whether they were needed.</seg>
<seg id="211">In fact, almost half of an output record for demolition work was made up of such needs.</seg>
<seg id="212">Loose and Valuation Criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In the case of many assignments, there was no reason to justify the fact that most of the benefits awarded were not further divided into part-timers.</seg>
<seg id="214">There were no complaints about the criteria to be used in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="215">References to freelance workers</seg>
<seg id="216">A small part of the descriptions included references to the professionals involved.</seg>
<seg id="217">Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in appended plans or opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even expressly requested applicants to contact the architect "on tendering issues."</seg>
<seg id="219">In the building sector in particular, the contracting authorities largely relied on the complaints that had been made on the basis of the failure of the professionals responsible for the production of the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="220">The construction services pointed to the lack of capacity in order to be able to control the performance descriptions adequately.</seg>
<seg id="221">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitations to tender In the case of public procurement for the construction of a dwelling with 12 dwelling units, a supplier and a specific product mark were specified in the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="223">The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying them.</seg>
<seg id="224">The call also identified suppliers and products for the construction of several university buildings.</seg>
<seg id="225">Performance descriptions with performance units</seg>
<seg id="226">In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the extent and nature of the services required in the performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="227">As power units, it only indicated the built-up space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of the descriptions</seg>
<seg id="229">During the construction of a motorway line, the performance descriptions were changed four times during the period August to September 2009 as part of an open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="230">Since the levels of benefit had increased considerably and the technical conditions had changed.</seg>
<seg id="231">Tender documents for social construction included inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary design tests and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services.</seg>
<seg id="232">In the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the indoor equipment did not include product quality requirements.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors built over-expensive and inappropriate high-quality equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Free movement of persons and freedom to provide services</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, the division of construction activities into lots or sub-contracts is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="236">An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that, if selected parts had been allocated freely, savings of up to EUR 31.6 million would have been possible with a total cost of EUR 620.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, it would have been possible to save EUR 2.5 million (25%) for six different works which were the subject of a single contract.</seg>
<seg id="238">A separate award of the building of 20 bridges would have enabled savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) to be made compared with an overall award.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the award of construction works in the road construction sector, the central awarding authority laid down very large reference requirements as criteria of suitability.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority requested tenderers in an open procedure to demonstrate, inter alia, at least three road projects carried out, each worth EUR 28 million over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public award of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects in which the contracting authority had set an annual volume of construction of at least EUR 480 million over the last three years as a criterion for the company's suitability.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of the funds allocated to road projects in 2008 and 2009 (EUR 2.5 billion of a total of EUR 3.7 billion) were accounted for by orders from a total of five companies carrying out the contracts alone or as a working group.</seg>
<seg id="244">In the case of 46 tendering procedures with a contract size of EUR 528 million, only two or even one tenderer submitted tenders.</seg>
<seg id="245">The NKDP showed that a reduction in market potential may result in significant cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Additional benefits</seg>
<seg id="247">In the case of the construction of a motorway number, the contracting authority did not apply any of the procedures laid down by law to the award of additional services and did not conclude any written contracts concerning the additional services.</seg>
<seg id="248">As a result of unclear quantitative and quality targets, there were increases of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) in the first case and up to EUR 165.4 million (net) in the second case, which increased by 21%.</seg>
<seg id="249">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="250">In the case of several higher education buildings, some services were not included in the contract documents, although their need for award was already known.</seg>
<seg id="251">Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiated procedures with the authorised undertakings without notifying the contract.</seg>
<seg id="252">During the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiated procedures without invitations to tender.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by EUR 2 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices for the additional works awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">On the basis of a sample of construction projects, the NKDP found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic was up to EUR 14.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">In Germany, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to EUR 10.4 million, following an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that motorway construction is more expensive in the Czech Republic than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="260">The basic rules on the procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take account of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="261">They serve both full and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">For example, the requirement that the specifications are sufficiently precise is intended to enable tenderers to calculate and prepare their tenders in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="263">To protect the contracting authority from additional services which are subsequently to be agreed, and also to limit the scope for speculation.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the common basic requirements relating to the procurement documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at reducing further restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="265">There are no such standards in the Czech Republic, for which transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="266">The requirements for the description of qualifications have been largely met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, divergences had to be objected to, which could also have led to restrictions of competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The German requirement for the formation of lots promotes competition and leads to economic results.</seg>
<seg id="269">In the Czech Republic, according to the NKDP audit findings, the award of large services without lots, or with very large losers, may result in restrictions on the range of suppliers to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="270">The extensive reference requirements laid down in the Czech Republic in road construction have resulted in public contracts being awarded only to a narrow range of suppliers and small and medium-sized enterprises not being allowed to participate in competition.</seg>
<seg id="271">Moreover, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">In the case of the award and remuneration of supplementary or amended benefits, the rules differ from one country to another.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to the EU rules and the German rules, supplementary benefits with a value of up to half of the main contract may be awarded, subject to certain conditions, without public contract award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% is applied, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor by negotiated procedure without notice.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded if:</seg>
<seg id="277">Since the scope of public contracts is often insufficiently determined.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the overrun is greater than 20%, the additional benefits must be made public.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and consequent adverse effects can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Setting the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of award, the contracting authority shall determine the size of the number of undertakings participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">It may leave the list of potential candidates and tenderers largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by specifying non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="283">Construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded shall be subject to European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">In choosing the type of award, the contracting authority shall take into account, in particular, European competition and transparency requirements.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total value of the construction work of a project is below or above the EU threshold of currently EUR 5,000,000, the construction work should, in principle, be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="288">The contracting authority may derogate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European award in the case of works contracts which exceed or exceed the EU threshold and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated total value of the contract is</seg>
<seg id="289">A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reasons, or deliberately estimated at too low cost, in order to avoid the obligation to award construction services at European level in principle.</seg>
<seg id="290">As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of type of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="291">The detailed justification of the type of award chosen and the examination of the obligation to apply EU procurement schemes are important elements in the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Regulations of German and Czech Procurement Law</seg>

<seg id="294">Both countries have fully transposed the EU legislation on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equivalence of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction commitments which are not subject to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="297">There is freedom of choice between the open procedure and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible under certain conditions defined by law.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national assignments - the public tendering procedure is, in principle, a priority. This is laid down in budgetary and procurement law and in the anti-corruption directives.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of award - such as the restricted procedure or invitation to tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated by the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">The existence of an exceptional case must be clearly substantiated and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of primacy of the open procedure or of the public tendering procedure is intended to ensure as unrestricted competition as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by fixing certain tenderers and to make possible price agreements between tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="302">The principle of public tender is a central element in the prevention of corruption in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimation of the estimated value of the contract is an essential basis for the choice of the correct type of award.</seg>
<seg id="304">The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the estimated costs in the public building sector.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, inter alia, cost characteristics for categories of buildings, units of use, components or individual works.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such cost characteristics, it is possible to determine the estimated contract value of a planned project or of a construction output to be supplied.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few construction administrations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, a federal introduction is planned for all road construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting entities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price surveys of comparable construction activities to determine the estimated cost of construction services.</seg>
<seg id="310">On the contrary, the cost surveys are based in most cases on estimates by the financing body or on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.</seg>
<seg id="312">The relevant ministries were commissioned under the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012 to create a database of standardised building materials and materials.</seg>
<seg id="313">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="314">The purpose of this database is to collect information on material expenditure and on construction and support works, as well as other cost-related data, in order to permit cost surveys and unit price regulations.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a data collection for construction projects in order to improve cost control.</seg>
<seg id="316">This will serve as a benchmark for the fixing of prices in the financing plan and is currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="317">Main findings of the audit</seg>
<seg id="318">Choice of award procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The tendering bodies audited largely completed the works by open procedure or by public invitation to tender, thus complying with the budgetary and procurement requirements.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the federal building services were public or open to tender in the building sector.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction this share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">In the selection of non-public tender types, there were in part no detailed reasons why the contracting authorities had to derogate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.</seg>
<seg id="323">In a cross-cutting investigation, the Brh found, on the basis of more than 16,000 award procedures, that non-public tendering procedures have significant disadvantages in terms of competition and increased the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">In the building sector, public tenders received more than twice as many tenders as in the case of restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as in the case of voluntary contracts.</seg>
<seg id="325">The investigation also showed that tender prices for restricted tenders and voluntary contracts were on average 6% and 10% higher, respectively, than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a Land Accounting Court confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public types of tendering.</seg>
<seg id="327">The Federal Ministry of Construction, as a result of its studies on economic efficiency, even came to double the difference between public and non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="329">In the case of construction projects for which they had established an estimated total contract amount of more than EUR 5,000,000, the audited entities established procurement plans in which they set out the national procurement procedures and the procedures for the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, this has always accounted for more than 80% of construction services throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">It was not possible to overturn the commitment to EU-wide spending through underestimated cost estimates.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, partly as a result of erroneous calculations, there has been a factual undercutting of the minimum proportion of your procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="333">During the construction process, some awarding bodies wrongly modified the specifications of their procurement plans.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these amendments and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">For most of the measures audited, the proportion of EU-wide deliveries according to the accounting results was usually lower than provided for in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities failed to commit all 1,000,000 euros and more large single lots in EU-wide procedures.</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they chose national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="338">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of type of award</seg>
<seg id="340">In several major construction operations, such as the construction of some sections of motorway, construction projects in a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided works into several parts, although these services were similar or similar.</seg>
<seg id="341">As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods of calculating the estimated value of the contract</seg>
<seg id="343">In road construction, the existing price databases for this sector have been insufficient to determine the expected value of orders.</seg>
<seg id="344">The data were based on construction projects which have just been completed, but where there was evidence of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits from the firms involved.</seg>
<seg id="345">For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than expected orders obtained from the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases to take account not only of supply prices in recent years but also of comparable market prices and price increases in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the building sector, the estimated orders were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on investors' estimates.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual orders values deviate strongly from the estimates.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later, but eight additional contracts resulted in a cost increase of EUR 2.1 million and 27%, respectively, as a result of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, the actual value of orders for the construction of a library site was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases again in the construction phase.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, supply prices exceeded the estimates and increased during construction.</seg>
<seg id="352">When a large library was built, the estimated price was exceeded by EUR 16 million or 22%. When a judicial building was built, costs increased disproportionately, at 139%, as the useful land had increased by only 12%.</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have transposed EU rules into national law to establish the type of award and to take account of the EU threshold. Therefore, the regulations are largely in line with each other.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the priority of open procedure or public tendering in Germany goes beyond EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to the non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in competition in public procedures or public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="357">The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most economic results.</seg>
<seg id="358">The risk of corruption will be considerably improved by not restricting the applicant field by the contracting authority's regulatory requirements and by making price agreements between tenderers more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="359">The investigations confirmed the merits of the primacy of the open procedure or of the public tendering procedure in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="360">Under Czech legislation, contracting authorities may award contracts by open or non-open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">According to the latest changes in the procurement law, the number of tenderers may no longer be restricted in proceedings involving previous competition for participation.</seg>
<seg id="362">As a result, the open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely followed the rules on the primacy of the open procedure or the public tendering procedure. In the Czech Republic, some benefits have been allocated unlawfully in order to avoid the requirements for selecting the type of award.</seg>
<seg id="364">If the EU threshold had to be taken into account, errors had to be identified in Germany, which led to a fall in the minimum proportion of benefits awarded across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, there is not yet a satisfactory solution in order to be able to accurately determine the expected cost of works and construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">The building administrations should, where appropriate,: Further checks will ensure that the criteria for selecting the type of award and the level of performance to be awarded throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for proper cost investigations are established.</seg>
<seg id="367">Prior information and publicity</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of construction projects with works to be delivered throughout Europe, the public works contractor must inform interested companies of the proposed contracts in advance of the invitation to tender.</seg>

<seg id="387">In Germany, no preliminary information is required on non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public invitations to tender and participation competitions before restricted invitations to tender are available on the federal web portal and, where appropriate, Also to be published in newspapers or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted invitations to tender without competition for participation, notices of services to be awarded are required from EUR 25,000 (ex ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">The preliminary information shall include all the planned lots of the construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="391">In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the vague construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="392">In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as much less construction work is divided into lots.</seg>
<seg id="393">Main findings of the audit</seg>
<seg id="394">Brh</seg>
<seg id="395">Preliminary information</seg>
<seg id="396">The tendering bodies studied published preliminary information on all tested construction projects with works to be delivered throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open procedures, however, they shortened the deadlines for the submission of tenders, although the 52-day deadline required between the dispatches of the preliminary information and the notices had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">Other shortened procedures were only negotiated after the 12-month period of validity of the preliminary information expires and before it had been extended.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned breakdown of construction services into lots.</seg>
<seg id="400">Notices</seg>
<seg id="401">The notices of the audited bodies contained in part CPV codes which differed from the information given in the preliminary information or which did not correctly record the requested services.</seg>
<seg id="402">In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information, e.g. For example, the deadlines for implementation - as the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">The tendering bodies of a inspected building administration had instructed a service undertaking to publish the national tendering procedures.</seg>
<seg id="405">It published the notifications on its own priced procurement platform.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contracting authorities did not verify whether the company had forwarded the notifications, as required, to the Federal Internet portal free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="407">Samples showed that only one third of the reports of the audited administration were published on this portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="409">Notices</seg>
<seg id="410">In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wished to select the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="411">The contracting authority could not prove how the tenderers were selected.</seg>
<seg id="412">The limitation of the number of tenderers was permitted under the law in force at that time.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, in an open procedure, the awarding authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure whether it wished to assess the qualification of the candidates and how many candidates.</seg>
<seg id="414">In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six candidates complied with the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicant with the worst scores from the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="415">The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because it had not disclosed any information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of notices</seg>
<seg id="417">In the renovation of former military sites, the contracting authority did not publish the invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="418">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage information and publicity information system is an important element in implementing transparency in Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">Both countries have implemented the EU guidelines and have also increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement field:</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates for non-public tendering procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">In contrast to public procurement procedures, non-public procurement procedures do not allow any undertaking interested in the performance of the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="423">In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a preliminary selection of which undertakings are to be invited to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="424">EU legislation and anti-corruption requirements EU regulations allow for a limitation of the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, in the case of procedures which are not open, at least five undertakings shall be required to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="426">At least three undertakings shall be invited in the case of negotiated procedures with a notice of award.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be known beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of undertakings to be requested is an operation within the award procedure which is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. For example, it is possible to favour certain companies unilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="430">In addition, the restriction of competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both cases, the result of the award may be significantly affected at the expense of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="432">The contracting authorities are therefore required to make special arrangements against possible manipulation, to carry out adequate checks and, in particular, to ensure the transparency and traceability of this process step.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regulations of German and Czech Procurement Law</seg>
<seg id="434">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="435">The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should, as often as possible, change between the companies to be requested when selecting the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor must competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The contracting authorities shall justify the selection of candidates and record the progress of the selection procedure in their contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, in the case of restricted invitations to tender, at least three and in the case of voluntary contracts, a number of suitable candidates must in principle be required to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="441">Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of tenderers in cases of restricted procedures and negotiated procedures.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the choice of enterprises must take account of the multi-eye principle.</seg>
<seg id="443">Has e.g. For example, a staff member has proposed a number of undertakings for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or an agent from the contracting authority will usually have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a new</seg>
<seg id="444">The aim is to prevent a single person from finalising the list of undertakings to be involved in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">Otherwise, in the case of rigorous intentions, this could allow far-reaching agreements between the parties concerned.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of undertakings to be requested must be treated in a confidential manner, including with regard to professionals, and must not be made generally accessible.</seg>
<seg id="447">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic, there are no regulations for setting up and keeping secret candidate lists.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under the German regulations freelance workers are not allowed to determine the undertakings to be called upon, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation on this.</seg>
<seg id="451">Main findings of the audit</seg>
<seg id="452">Brh</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of applicants</seg>
<seg id="454">The requirement to require a minimum number of undertakings to submit tenders in the case of non-public contracts has been complied with, with a few exceptions.</seg>
<seg id="455">An evaluation of the total of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide award procedures for building works in the building sector showed that, in Germany, the tendering agencies requested an average of 6.6 and an average of 4.4 for voluntary tendering.</seg>
<seg id="456">Transfers of undertakings and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular, in the case of industries with few suppliers, the contracting authorities did not always change the range of candidates selected.</seg>
<seg id="458">In particular, they took account of companies which have already been known to them and which have been proven from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="459">The reason for this was that, in the case of non-public procedures, they had to ensure the suitability of the undertakings to be charged with competition before the invitation to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="460">An inadmissible restriction on regional tenderers was not found by the Court in the case of non-public tendering procedures, but a higher proportion of regional firms than in the case of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="461">This was mainly due to the fact that, on average, the level of performance in the non-public procurement procedures was much lower and therefore, e.g. For example, longer access routes are more important than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Multi-eye principle and proposals for freelance workers</seg>
<seg id="463">Contrary to the rules, the majority of the awarding bodies failed to change the proposed list of requesting undertakings by an independent person.</seg>
<seg id="464">They justified this in particular by lack of processing capacity, forward pressure or lack of knowledge of alternative suitable companies.</seg>
<seg id="465">Nor was it often documented who had proposed the companies invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="466">Some samples showed that freelance workers had drawn up the lists of candidates and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="467">In this way, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves from possible manipulation to the extent necessary.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidential handling of lists of tenderers</seg>
<seg id="469">In the case of a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system which could be consulted by all the staff of that service.</seg>
<seg id="470">In the case of rigorous intentions, the names of the planned or approved companies would have been passed on unauthorised, e.g. B. Agreements between these undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation of the award procedures contained only a few justifications for the selection of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="473">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection of candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">In the construction of a motorway ring, tenderers received no information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="476">In the case of non-open procedures for the extension and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not contain any information on how the selection of candidates should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="477">In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of firms to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Procurement Committee then carried out a batch procedure for the selection of enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="479">However, this approach, which was accepted in principle at the time, should have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="481">Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special measures to prevent unauthorised restrictions of competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">With the multi-eye principle, the secrecy of the tenderers' lists and the exclusive power of the contracting authorities to propose the undertakings to be called upon, the German rules restrict such abuse.</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of the Czech regulations, in particular, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of tenderers in the case of non-public procedures can counteract possible manipulation restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have not been adequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participation has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">The contracting authorities should fully eliminate the shortcomings identified.</seg>
<seg id="486">Supply phase</seg>
<seg id="487">The tender notice or the invitation to tender shall begin the tendering phase in which the undertakings may draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.</seg>
<seg id="488">Candidates may submit their tenders until the end of the time limit set by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="489">EU law and corruption prevention requirements</seg>
<seg id="490">There are no separate EU legal requirements for this stage of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authorities must comply with the national rules designed to counteract the possibilities of manipulation existing during the supply phase.</seg>
<seg id="492">These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.</seg>
<seg id="493">Regulations of German and Czech Procurement Law</seg>
<seg id="494">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="495">The tender documents on the basis of which the undertakings are to draw up their tenders shall, in principle, be sent only by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Professionals involved in the award procedure may not carry out this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority shall ensure that all candidates receive the same information during the submission phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of ambiguity in the tender documents or other questions relating to the invitation to tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="499">No information may be supplied to professionals responsible for the preparation of the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the entire period of the offer, contact must be prevented between the freelancers and the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="501">Freelance workers must not become a focal point in the award procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive effects can be established.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders shall be submitted by post or by direct mail in a closed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Tenders submitted electronically must have a technical encryption.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may also entrust the printing and dispatch of the tender documents to external service companies whose employees must be obliged to secrecy the tenders and to comply with the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="506">The tenders received shall be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and sent directly, immediately and unopened to an official responsible for the preservation.</seg>
<seg id="507">Such staff member may not be involved in the award.</seg>
<seg id="508">Tenders shall be closed until the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a reference number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority shall record the tender data, including contract numbers, and the production and receipt information.</seg>
<seg id="511">There is no specific provision for the preservation of tenders in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="512">Main findings of the audit</seg>
<seg id="513">Brh</seg>
<seg id="514">The tender phase audits focused mainly on the award procedures of a building administration.</seg>
<seg id="515">Dispatch of tender documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The contracting authorities of the inspected building management sent the contract documents themselves or were able to print and send them through an external service company.</seg>
<seg id="517">Freelance workers did not send any tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to applicants</seg>
<seg id="519">The inspected building management largely failed to comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and award in the designation of the contact points for requests for feedback and information.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the performance descriptions, it indicated not staff from the awarding authority but from the project leaders as contact points, contrary to the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some tender documents even included the names of freelancers who had produced the performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="522">In the case of requests during the tender phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="523">Identification of tenders</seg>
<seg id="524">In the inspected building management, all tenders received were marked with an entry stamp and entry note.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in the case of some freelance assignments, the offers were made to freelancers, which contravened the provisions on the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Preservation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Once it had been identified, not all tenders were received directly and without delay to the person responsible for the storage, who included the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">In the meantime, in a construction service, the tenders were filed in an open section of the post office to which each staff member had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another service had suspended a letter box in a flight which was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers made there even stayed overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">Since the slot in this letter box was large and unsecured, not only staff, but also visitors to the service, would have been able to obtain the tenders received and, if necessary, President. - The next item is the report (Doc.</seg>
<seg id="531">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="532">No deficiencies were made on the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="534">During the supply phase, contacts between interested firms and professionals involved in the award procedure will be avoided in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="535">In addition, by receiving the same information to all tenderers, the principle of equal treatment is to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="536">The rules governing the receipt, retention and secrecy of tenders appear appropriate in order to counteract manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">The corresponding targets in Germany are somewhat broader than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed infringements of the rules in a number of areas.</seg>

<seg id="544">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">There are no separate EU rules governing the opening up of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive requirements for the protection of offers and competition.</seg>

<seg id="549">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening date shall be determined by a number of persons to be designated by the contracting authority.</seg>

<seg id="565">According to the German rules, the minutes of the opening date shall include, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and discounts, as well as specific features such as damaged or delayed tenders.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature of the applicant shall be recorded.</seg>

<seg id="572">Main findings of the audit</seg>
<seg id="573">Brh</seg>
<seg id="574">Multi-eye principle</seg>
<seg id="575">The audited Procurement Bodies implemented the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.</seg>
<seg id="576">They each carried out the opening dates with negotiators and writers who were not responsible for any other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in the case of voluntary contracts of less scope, there were some cases where freelance workers opened tenders to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Protocol</seg>
<seg id="579">In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of tenders was not always fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, e.g. For example, the late submission of tenders was not registered, and in individual cases signatures were even missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Identification of tenders</seg>
<seg id="582">The tendering bodies examined during the cross-sectional examination identified the tenders by means of a perforation with the date of the opening date, in accordance with the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="583">Insufficient markings were found in longer-term trials carried out by some beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="584">These awarding bodies, however, changed their labelling practice after the complaint was lodged by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id="585">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="586">Time limit for submission of tenders</seg>
<seg id="587">In the award of road maintenance measures, a tender was submitted to the contracting authority only one month after the closing date for the submission of tenders. The contracting authority nevertheless accepted this offer.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="589">The rules governing the opening-up of tenders in both countries are substantially the same. They take account of both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risk of corruption and manipulation in the opening of tenders can be considerably reduced.</seg>
<seg id="590">The targets in Germany are broader than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">In particular, the requirements for accurate documentation of the procedure, labelling, safe storage and secrecy of tenders restrict the possibility of manipulation, such as: B. Secondary amendments to the tenders</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, those responsible for opening the tenders must not perform any other tasks relating to the performance to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The total of only a few complaints demonstrate the high degree of acceptance of the supply opening requirements.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">The contracting authority shall examine and evaluate the tenders submitted at the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="596">In so doing, he shall determine the tender for the award of the contract, which, in accordance with the specified award criteria, is best suited to the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">The EU's rules provide for a multi-stage procedure:</seg>
<seg id="599">First of all, the suitability of the tenderers must be established.</seg>
<seg id="600">Tenderers must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical skills.</seg>
<seg id="601">Whereas, in principle, participation in the award procedure should be excluded from the scope of the Directive; For example, are legally convicted of bribery or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="602">The tenders submitted by the non-excluded tenderers shall be examined in terms of calculation, technical and economic terms and shall be assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority shall determine the most economically advantageous tender. Tenders with abnormally low prices shall be subject to special examination by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="604">The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly sensitive phase of the tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, tenderers may be unjustifiably excluded or tenders which do not meet the requirements may be kept in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">By favouring or discriminating against tenderers, the evaluation result can be adversely affected in an inadmissible manner, thus preventing the identification of the most economically advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore make special arrangements to ensure that the persons responsible for testing and evaluating comply with the integrity and expertise requirements.</seg>
<seg id="608">It shall also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and of the decisions taken.</seg>
<seg id="609">Regulations of German and Czech Procurement Law</seg>
<seg id="610">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="611">In accordance with EU requirements, tenders in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements for the suitability of the undertakings to be submitted, the award criteria to be taken into account in the assessment and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the tender documents and can no longer be altered during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">Once the suitability of the tender has been verified, the criteria of suitability may no longer be taken into account when evaluating the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="614">The evaluation shall be limited to the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be formally examined as soon as possible to determine whether they are complete and whether, for example, Abnormalities that might indicate possible tampering intentions are included.</seg>
<seg id="616">Where tenderers are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they shall be informed forthwith.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the value of the tenders appears to be unduly low, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment before possible exclusion of his tender.</seg>
<seg id="618">The decisions taken in the examination and evaluation of tenders shall be clearly documented.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the tenders to be kept secret may be made available only to the persons directly responsible for processing.</seg>
<seg id="621">The examination of tenders and the auditing of tenders may be carried out only by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="622">It shall only employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.</seg>
<seg id="623">The performance of the other audit and evaluation tasks is not specified.</seg>
<seg id="624">Where professionals are entrusted with the examination and evaluation of tenders, they shall treat tenders in a confidential manner.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="626">Procurement committees must be set up in the Czech Republic to examine and evaluate tenders.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees shall draw up evaluation reports with proposals for award.</seg>
<seg id="628">At the end of the day, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="629">Where the documents or declarations required for the submission of tenders in Germany are submitted in incomplete form, the contracting authority shall give tenderers the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only if the documents are still not available after the expiry of the time limit can the offer be excluded from the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives tenderers the opportunity to complete the lack of evidence or explanations.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a tenderer fails to do so, he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, in addition to the total price, it is also necessary to examine the unit prices (prices for partial services) of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="634">Where, on the basis of the price structure of the offer, there is evidence that the price of partial services is too low or too high, the tenderer must be required to remove these ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id="635">If he fails to do so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of prices, that offer must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">The aim of the invention is to prevent tenderers from speculating in the calculation of their tender for substantial changes in the quantity of partial services, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of the construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price is considered, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.</seg>
<seg id="638">A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of a tender.</seg>
<seg id="639">Tenders with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="640">Where one or more tenders are less than or equal to the relevant price determination by the contracting authority of the other tenderers, tenderers shall furnish proof of the correct calculation of their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="641">Where they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the tenders in question.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the tendering procedure may be cancelled after the audit of profitability if tenders with unjustifiable low prices are available only.</seg>
<seg id="643">In contrast to the German law on procurement, the award cannot therefore be refused in the case of tenders with prices substantially higher than the purchaser's calculation.</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">The Commission must decide what measures should be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor should be informed.</seg>
<seg id="646">The level of technical supervision must, for example: For example, in the case of works of more than EUR 50,000 if a contract is to be awarded voluntarily, a contract is not to be awarded to the lowest price tender or the invitation to tender is to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">There are no regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">Main findings of the audit</seg>
<seg id="649">Brh</seg>
<seg id="650">Suitability and assessment criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">The vast majority of tendering procedures audited complied with the requirements set out above.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of some companies proposed by professionals, the contracting authorities did not verify the suitability of the companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">A beneficiary instructed companies to do so without the required proof of suitability being available in full.</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, it was not comprehensible whether the contracting authority took into account all the award criteria announced in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the 'price' criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of persons involved and secrecy of tenders</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons to examine tenders for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="657">For example, freelance workers or staff involved in planning or carrying out a construction project carried out tasks which were only to be performed by the staff of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction services justified this with insufficient staff capacity in the respective sectors.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, the freelance professionals responsible for the examination of tenders also involved staff who were not obliged to secrecy the tenders and to comply with the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="660">For the construction services, it was also often unclear whether tenders were available to freelancers only to those directly involved in the processing.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and auditing of tenders</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting authorities transferred the open tenders to freelance agents for further examination without having previously carried out the required review of the tenders and the accounting examination itself and documenting their results.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the case of rigorous intentions, third parties would have been able to make changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="664">In some of the documents examined, anomalies or lack of price or product information were not or were insufficiently marked.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance ASSESSMENTS</seg>
<seg id="666">In the case of a sample in a building administration, the most favourable offers for three-quarters of the tendering procedures audited accounted for more than 10% of the estimated costs previously determined.</seg>
<seg id="667">Each twentieth award procedure was cancelled because of inadequate tender prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">Not all tenders and presentations with tenderers were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, more detailed information was lacking, such as the unit prices of the main items.</seg>
<seg id="670">In many cases, the discrepancies were due only to a flat-rate basis, e.g. For example, by indicating changes in market prices or increased material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction services explained that it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of an invitation to tender from an institution governed by public law, the tender price of the most favourable tender was 66% lower than the previously determined estimate of these services.</seg>
<seg id="673">Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this difference were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="674">In an information conversation, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the undertaking then authorised.</seg>
<seg id="675">As a result, it was unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Subsequently, the contracting entity assessed the company delegated as a "low-cost company" which could not maintain quality or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In the case of another invitation to tender, a construction service awarded the award to a tender, the price of which was 35% higher than the value of the cost assessment.</seg>
<seg id="678">It did not cancel the invitation to tender and set out the relevant reasons for the fact that the company could be concluded on a conventional calculation basis.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">In the case of a inspected building administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were notified to the technical inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one of the cases, in the case of a tendering procedure, the calculation of two tenderers was identical, so that the contracting authority excluded both tenders from the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="682">There were no significant complaints about the application of the other schemes.</seg>
<seg id="683">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="684">Aptitude test</seg>
<seg id="685">In many of the projects examined, such as higher education, road construction and the extension of the railway network, tenderers did not qualify for the procedure, although they failed to satisfy the conditions laid down in the tender documents. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could not substantiate or explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Valuation</seg>
<seg id="687">In the award of construction services to a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the predetermined criteria of assessment in the examination and evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="688">In the case of a construction project for the extension of the railway network, the contracting authority established the weighting of the criteria of assessment only at the beginning of the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion "shortening the construction phase" was misinterpreted in one procedure.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the reduction offered was insufficiently taken into account by the bidders in the second and third positions.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the selection of tenders</seg>
<seg id="692">In three tendering procedures in the context of housing support, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it applied and on the basis of which it had selected the successful tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="693">In the construction of a motorway, the awarding authority selected companies for smaller orders of up to EUR 20 000 on the basis of telephone interviews on prices and delivery conditions alone.</seg>
<seg id="694">This selection was not possible because the interviews were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="696">The rules governing the examination and evaluation of tenders are in line with EU requirements in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the rules differ from one another.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and for the protection of offers, regulate the process more closely than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be verified.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, in some of the tendering procedures audited, it had to be established that essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not documented or were insufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="701">However, without the comprehensibility and transparency of audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulation is encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly serious shortcoming was the transfer of all tenders to third parties, without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently seen and documented the tenders, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in the subsequent procedure.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contracting authorities have tasks to perform in the examination and evaluation of tenders by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased supervisory effort are required in order to respond to the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">In assessing the appropriateness of prices, the services audited in Germany have not always fully utilised the set of instruments, with insufficient analysis of the price structure of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="705">There were complaints in the Czech Republic, particularly regarding aptitude tests and the application of assessment criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After the tenders have been examined and evaluated, the award procedure is completed by issuing the award or by cancelling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of EU-wide award procedures, tenderers must be informed beforehand of the proposed award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">Undertakings may examine the intended award by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or in the case of other means of communication within 15 days and, where appropriate, To initiate an investigation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="711">No contract may be concluded before the end of this period of notice.</seg>
<seg id="712">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="713">If a tenderer submits a request for review within the time limit for information, a contract may not be concluded until after the final decision has been taken in the investigation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">The undertakings may also have the award decision reviewed in the context of this review procedure by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">The purpose of the review procedure is to ensure the legal protection of undertakings and to encourage the contracting authority to respect the contract law throughout the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="716">To this end, it must document the procedure adequately.</seg>
<seg id="717">Regulations of German and Czech Procurement Law</seg>
<seg id="718">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it may not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contraaing authority shall award the contraa within the time limit specified in the contract notice:</seg>
<seg id="723">Also because, after the expiry of the time limit, tenderers are no longer bound by their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="724">In the case of open and restricted procedures or public or restricted invitations to tender, the contracting authority may not, in principle, derogate from the content of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="725">The undersigned tenderers shall be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for the failure to take into account their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="726">Tendering procedures may be terminated only under certain conditions, e.g. For example, where the tender prices are too high or where the tenders do not meet the requirements of the invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the 10-day and 15-day information and waiting period prior to the award of contracts also applies to construction services which are not to be supplied throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, these requirements apply only to EU-wide assignments.</seg>
<seg id="730">In the case of other procedures in Germany, tenderers may be informed of the award decision only after the award has been made.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure should be terminated if only one tender has been received or only one tender could be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of a single tender, provided that it complies with the conditions of the invitation to tender and is economic.</seg>
<seg id="733">Main findings of the audit</seg>
<seg id="734">Brh</seg>
<seg id="735">In the case of the audited contracts, there were only a few complaints concerning the completion of the award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, EU-wide contracts have already been awarded to companies before the information deadlines have expired, which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In individual cases, letters of invitation to tender also contained different contents from the content of the tender, such as: B. Modified dates.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, the contracting entities did not comply with the award deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="739">In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the award to the second most favourable tender, since an undertaking with a 50% more favourable offer was no longer prepared to deliver the services at the price initially offered after the award period expired.</seg>
<seg id="740">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of a building measure in the higher education sector, the content of the contract differs from that offered by the tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="742">In some cases, for example in the case of road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts at the end of the statutory period.</seg>
<seg id="743">In the award of works for the rehabilitation of former military sites, the contracting authority did not send the notice of award to all tenderers until the end of the legal period.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements for the completion of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of the subcontractors or tenderers increases the range of anti-corruption instruments.</seg>
<seg id="747">The scope of legal protection in Czech procurement law has also been extended to issues below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, the time limits for the award of contracts were exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">The construction authorities should in future avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The award procedures shall be documented in a comprehensible manner during their stages with regard to the relevant findings and the reasons for each decision.</seg>
<seg id="753">In the case of EU-wide procedures, the orders issued must be made public.</seg>
<seg id="754">Order data are also collected in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">EU law requirements and corruption prevention The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide offer of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="756">A careful and timely documentation makes it possible to understand the procurement decisions.</seg>
<seg id="757">In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of tenderers when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential part of the prevention of corruption, as the need to justify procurement decisions in detail considerably reduces the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">The contract notice for an EU-wide award procedure must be sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union within 48 days.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, which also implements the offer of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authorities are also required to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and to report through the relevant national ministries of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission produces annual EU statistics to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.</seg>
<seg id="763">Regulations of German and Czech Procurement Law</seg>
<seg id="764">Equal or similar arrangements</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.</seg>
<seg id="766">The documentation and reporting arrangements for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Different regulations</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is limited not only to the EU-wide award procedures but also to the other award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notice period is reduced to 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide sales, publication is compulsory only in the case of restricted invitations to tender and in the case of hands-on sales above values of EUR 25 000 and EUR 15 000 without turnover tax ( Ex post transparency).</seg>
<seg id="771">Below these limits and in the case of public invitations to tender, only the undertakings involved in the competition procedure receive information on the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="772">Main findings of the audit</seg>
<seg id="773">Brh</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of the tendering procedures audited were not fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as: For reasons of product specification or references to national regulations.</seg>
<seg id="777">In a tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it gave the contract to an undertaking, although its tender did not contain any evidence to be given.</seg>
<seg id="778">In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the documents necessary for the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="779">Notices of award of contracts</seg>
<seg id="780">In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publish the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="781">In other award procedures, there was no evidence that the awarding bodies had made the contracts awarded known.</seg>
<seg id="782">Reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="783">The audited statistical records contained the minimum information required. They had been prepared and sent on time.</seg>
<seg id="784">Ex post transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the audited works administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="786">However, a building administration did not publish these data because of a transmission error.</seg>
<seg id="787">The Construction Administration noted this error only after six months.</seg>
<seg id="788">As a result, the contract data of the award procedures previously completed have not been published.</seg>
<seg id="789">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">In the case of the construction of a major sporting event, there were considerable deficiencies in the documentation of the award procedures. These were mainly incorrect information, such as false supply prices in the records of the Valuation Commissions.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some of the opening-up protocols were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Notices of award of contracts</seg>
<seg id="794">In the case of several road projects, notices of contracts awarded were only delayed or not published at all.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="796">The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting obligations are broadly consistent in both countries and implement EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="797">This will, in principle, ensure the transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="798">The rules to be applied to advertising in the Czech Republic go a little further than those in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="799">The deficiencies in documentation and notices that have been identified have partly significantly reduced the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="801">Construction administrations should continue to improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and orders and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits of the NKDP and the Brh have focused on two priorities which are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works by contracting authorities: The application of EU procurement rules and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">The provisions of EU law make cross-border competition possible to create a European internal market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Anti-corruption measures are not only used to prevent or at least reduce corruption. They are also intended to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state system.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audits carried out by the two audit bodies on the application of the law on procurement in both countries, together with the comparison of these regulations, reveal common features and differences which can help both countries to develop their procurement law and practice.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement rules</seg>
<seg id="808">The EU's standards for the award of construction services have transposed both countries into national law.</seg>
<seg id="809">Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of works and for taking into account the essential requirements of competition, the equal treatment of the undertakings concerned and the transparency of the award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">The construction administrations of both countries have, in some cases, made these bids subject to a very large number of other administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements for the construction services to be delivered across the EU to its nationally regulatable procurement procedures below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the Court's investigations have shown that construction administrations have not fully complied with EU law in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="813">The German Construction Administration should continue to improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to eliminate the complaints that have been made regarding the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">The audits carried out in the Czech Republic have, above all, identified risks that impair the economic viability of the assignments.</seg>
<seg id="815">For example, incomplete performance descriptions required additional benefits, often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, the cost investigations were mostly insufficiently carried out. Excessive skill requirements also reduced the number of potential tenderers and restricted competition, particularly in the transport sector.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">The aim of the investigations has not been to detect cases of corruption,</seg>
<seg id="818">It is also because the audit offices do not have the appropriate instruments to do so.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the audit offices may examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken steps to prevent corruption and manipulation in the award of works and how these requirements are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">In the fight against corruption, both countries have set different priorities.</seg>
<seg id="821">In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition, transparency and controls as key elements in the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech regulations aim above all to improve the transparency of procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">Brh</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply to the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles are also reflected in the specifications for the award of works and are tailored to their specific needs.</seg>
<seg id="826">In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very clearly the manner in which the requirements for the prevention of corruption must be taken into account in the conduct of the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="827">In particular, the Brh believes that the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument for significantly reducing the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate controls (in particular the multi-eye principle), rules on transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The Brh therefore considers that there is no need for any fundamental change in the administrative requirements for the award of works.</seg>
<seg id="830">In practice, the anti-corruption rules are largely taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="831">The shortcomings identified in sub-areas have revealed shortcomings in the implementation of some of the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Building administrations should continue to train their staff on the anti-corruption requirements and make them more aware of these issues.</seg>
<seg id="833">A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelance workers.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, without controls and adequate safeguards, there is a risk of abuse when delegating tasks.</seg>
<seg id="835">It is therefore appropriate to delegate tasks which are at risk of manipulation and corruption to third parties only if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.</seg>
<seg id="836">NKDP</seg>
<seg id="837">The Czech Republic adopted, at government level, a strategy against corruption, in which public procurement is the most important component.</seg>
<seg id="838">The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.</seg>
<seg id="839">The NKDP audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, as the contracting authorities must publish the economic viability of the award of contracts, the calculation of expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements and the quality of the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">The NKDP and the Brh are fundamentally positive about the implementation of the EU's targets.</seg>
<seg id="843">The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous material and ideological potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, the two courts have called on the construction authorities in their countries to continue their action against corruption and manipulation and, where appropriate, President. - The next item is the report (Doc.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisation and procedures of the award procedures should be constantly examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.</seg>
<seg id="847">The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures can provide a wider scope for competition and significantly reduce the risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="848">A greater division of construction services into lots may also have a beneficial effect on supply prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring that procurement procedures are carried out correctly is an essential basis for efficient procurement by public authorities.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, tendering procedures are carried out by the specialised construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks, with the exception of transport projects, are performed by the departments themselves or by contractors appointed by them.</seg>
<seg id="851">At the end of their joint project, the audit offices of both countries will continue to develop the relevant information for them and, where appropriate, President. - I call the Group of the European People's Party (Christian-Democratic Group).</seg>
<seg id="852">Both auditors are also convinced that the principles of procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI). The principles and findings set out above are of general importance in order to combat corruption effectively and in order to ensure the economic allocation of construction services in well-functioning and fair competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">Report on the audit</seg>
<seg id="3">Preface</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes are the main source of revenue for public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Court's activities should therefore focus on the audit of this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is particularly true of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">This alone will cause tax losses in the European Union of an estimated 100 billion euros1.</seg>
<seg id="8">Already at VI. EuroSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005 highlighted the need for closer cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">This enables auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and to optimise audit practice.</seg>
<seg id="10">Turnover tax (USt) is particularly suitable for cooperation as it is harmonised within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2006, for the first time, the audit offices of both States carried out parallel audits in the field of the UST.</seg>
<seg id="12">The relevant audit report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since UST fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the audit offices is needed. This makes it possible to assess fully whether the measures taken are capable of effectively combating UST fraud.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two audit offices decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel examination. Management of turnover tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>

<seg id="17">Audit subject: (CZ) Administration of the UST (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKDP), control audit</seg>
<seg id="18">Audit objective:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The administration of the UST and the handling of selected transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities in the field of inter-state assistance should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit should evaluate how the financial management has implemented the recommendations made by the auditors.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, other audit fields - linked to the UST - should be dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="22">The findings should be compared in order to determine whether the taxation procedures can be optimised.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audit period was 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period prior to the audit period until the closure of the audit.</seg>

<seg id="25">The audit bodies of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit for the administration of the UST.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the previous parallel investigation, they had discovered suspicion of intra-Community sales:</seg>
<seg id="27">A further examination appeared to be expedient.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the audit findings, the two auditors made recommendations on the administration of the UST.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aim of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the suspected cases identified should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also dealt with other matters. These included selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of UST claims and the audit of major companies.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this connection, the Court of Auditors found that:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous examination</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: The rules governing the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In the first audit, the courts compared the UST registration procedures in the two countries and found differences which caused problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">The audit offices therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxable persons within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This has also been taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of existing databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of the UST agents.</seg>
<seg id="38">The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="39">The auditors expected Member States to agree, in accordance with their decision in principle, on appropriate arrangements to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the UST system as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">The final version of the draft was agreed by the Member States in ECOFIN.</seg>
<seg id="41">These common rules are no longer included. The two courts deplore this.</seg>
<seg id="42">They continue to believe that such rules are important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary reports As a result of the first audit, the auditors recommended to the Member States that the summary reports (ZM) should in future be submitted monthly.</seg>
<seg id="44">The amounts of intra-Community sales could then be reviewed in more time.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the deadline for the submission of the ZM to one month</seg>
<seg id="46">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by a revision of the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, implementation did not come into force until 1 July 2010. It has thus not transposed the obligation to supply the ZM monthly into national law within the time limit laid down.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Data reconciliation between the UST pre-applications and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and suggest that the merging of the procedures for UST pre-applications and the ZM has set up the German</seg>
<seg id="49">The work has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level. During the first audit, the two auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria and elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The audit offices found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems which have both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The NKU examined the information exchange system within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Audit Court focused on German participation in the "Risk Management Platform."</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Verification of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">The Court of Auditors examined jointly during the first examination transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been exported or which were declared differently by the taxable persons of the two countries in the UST preliminary declarations (or USM declarations).</seg>
<seg id="58">The audit offices selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits carried out by the financial offices of both countries were not completed when the first parallel audit was completed.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit has shown that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. Appropriate measures had been taken by the respective tax administrations (e.g. retrospective UST fixing or the prevention of input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Examination of selected, particularly risky, intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between taxable persons in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is used to identify tax-payers who are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States may participate in this system on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the point of view of an active participating State, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">As a result, it was not possible to obtain any information on which suppliers with German UST-ID had been classified as highly risky cases.</seg>
<seg id="68">The NKU found both normal commercial transactions and those with suspicion of UST fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.</seg>
<seg id="69">The FEMs were able to examine transactions with a high risk only on a limited basis. This was particularly the case in the case of so-called "missing traders," where examination of the documents alone is scarcely sufficient to prove fraud to the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="70">In case of suspicion of carousel fraud in the case of imports and exports</seg>
<seg id="71">Is it advisable for customs and tax authorities to cooperate more closely to monitor the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer?</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany and a number of other countries have rejected active participation in EUROCANET because, in their view, there is no adequate legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Federal Audit Court noted that the German Treasury uses other instruments to identify taxpayers who are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="74">However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation:</seg>
<seg id="76">It was created by the Eurofisc.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be part of the planned network to combat UST fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, requests for mutual assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are dealt with in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="81">Federal Court of Auditors and NKU compare the statistics sent by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">These statistics revealed inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two audit offices consider it useful to re-discuss statistics at EU level in order to avoid future inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="84">If this is not done, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the statistics should contain more information on the UST.</seg>
<seg id="86">An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat US fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">Both auditors consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should endeavour to achieve at least the average recovery rate.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Commission should assist the Member States in this if this is desired.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. UST test for large firms</seg>
<seg id="90">The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation regarding the UST audit of large firms in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they collected information from the Treasury by means of a questionnaire, which they considered to be important in this context.</seg>
<seg id="92">It was clear that the situation was different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="93">The CZ has a system for the selection of risk-related cases which includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on UST audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss accounts).</seg>
<seg id="94">As a result, the UST control can be effectively controlled and analysed overall.</seg>
<seg id="95">A special tax office for large enterprises will be set up in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is still no comparable system in Germany. This makes it difficult to control and analyse the overall UST control.</seg>
<seg id="97">The German Treasury is more focused on the selection of individual cases and is based in particular on data from the UST pre-declarations or UST declarations and the CCs.</seg>
<seg id="98">Several risk management components to be improved support the evaluation of these data.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Examination PROCEDURE</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Audit procedures in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">Division II - State budget revenue and regional divisions IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava reviewed the period from May 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FES: Finance Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclac FA</seg>
<seg id="103">The Czech Court of Auditors' Senate approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Examination procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit area for transport taxes and staff of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="106">Following a selection of examples, they announced the examination in several countries:</seg>
<seg id="107">• Bavaria; • Hamburg; • Hesse; • North Rhine-Westphalia; • Saxony. They also conducted interviews with the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files from the following Fs were included in the audit: • Erke, Central Finance Office, Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regienburg, Weiden, Oberpfalz, Wifensa, Hamburg;</seg>
<seg id="109">Discussions were also held with the FES Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-South and OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Federal Audit Court informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two audit offices</seg>
<seg id="112">In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit issues.</seg>
<seg id="113">In December 2008, the Presidents of the two Courts signed the parallel audit cooperation agreement.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams discussed the initial results of the audit preparation, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The audit teams exchanged the audit findings so far and agreed on the timetable for the preparation of the joint audit report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two auditors identified the following issues for their parallel audit: • evaluation of the recommendations contained in the previous report; • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and from Germany;</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Audit of the management of turnover tax in selected sectors</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Implementation of the recommendations of the first joint audit</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">On the basis of the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended that the requirements for VAT registration be adapted and that new rules be introduced for the cancellation of registration in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="125">These revised rules should reduce the risk of possible tax evasion more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="126">In some cases, it was found that the FSA did not cancel the tax registration of taxable persons if they did not fulfil their obligations under Czech Law No 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "UST Act").</seg>
<seg id="127">So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted any amendment to oblige the FOS to cancel if the taxable person repeatedly does not submit any UST declarations.</seg>
<seg id="128">Under the Czech UST Act, the FA may abolish registration of a taxable person on its own initiative if:</seg>
<seg id="129">The first examination showed that, on the basis of the existing legal situation, FA Prague 1 had to abolish the UST registration of "foreign taxable persons" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">FA Prague 1 often did not abolish the UST registration of these taxable persons because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be properly implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was solved by the revision of the UST Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">It follows that the FA has the power to cancel the registration of a foreign taxable person if, during the previous calendar year, it did not provide taxable or exempt supplies of goods or services entitled to deduction of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly ZM levy</seg>
<seg id="135">On the basis of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive, which shortened the deadline for the submission of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the UST Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The ZM must now be issued electronically.</seg>
<seg id="138">In addition, a ZM must be issued where services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with Article 9 (1) of the UST law are provided to a person registered in another Member State as liable to turnover tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the UST for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC as regards the place of service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Matching the data of the UST pre-applications and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation related to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">In its ATIS4 system, the Czech Treasury automatically compares the data on intra-Community transactions from the UST declarations and the CCs.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">The proper collection of the UST is a sine qua non for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">That is why the fight against US fraud is a priority and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this is demonstrated, inter alia, by an investigation published by the European Commission in October 2009.</seg>
<seg id="148">An external expert estimated the UST loss for the 25 Member States over the period 2000 to 2006. On the basis of the available data, the tax shortfall for that period was estimated at between EUR 90 and 113 billion. This was based on the fact that, on average, the EU-25 lose 12% of their turnover taxes each year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first audit found that a Member State alone cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS).</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).</seg>
<seg id="153">For this purpose, intra-Community transactions carried out by taxable persons within the EU and covered by EUROCANET have been selected (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The Eurofisc network aims to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat UST fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities will be improved in order to identify fraud as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later, Eurofisc could be used as a tool to estimate the risk potential for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council6 already approved Eurofisc on 7 October 2008 and, at the same time, adopted the principles governing the operation of the system.</seg>
<seg id="157">Eurofisc is an example of EUROCANET, which has been developed by the Belgian Treasury in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7.</seg>
<seg id="158">The purpose of the system is to detect high-risk transactions and identify entrepreneurs involved in organised UST fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Implementation of recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations contained in the first report led to the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has developed, on the basis of a detailed questionnaire, a well-functioning system for the registration of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system itself is constantly improving.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data given in the questionnaire are now collected electronically and are later available for investigation. They are therefore part of the risk management of registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission had made a proposal8 amending Regulation 1798 / 2003. This included common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="168">There was still a need for clarification and clarification in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Federal Audit Court recommended that the Federal Ministry of Finance should not fall short of the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly ZM levy</seg>
<seg id="172">A bill on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted on 8 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="173">It contains, inter alia, provisions for the monthly delivery of the ZM for intra-Community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="174">And will enter into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Matching the data of the UST pre-notifications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and thinking about merging the previously separate procedures for issuing the UST pre-notifications and the ZM</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint federal-Länder working group has been set up to:</seg>
<seg id="178">A concept for the automatic matching of the data from the UST pre-applications and the ZM has been developed.</seg>
<seg id="179">The concept is still under discussion with the countries.</seg>
<seg id="180">This working group has also considered an approach to optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level At EU level, relevant information will be exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the initiative and initiated, by written procedure of 18 October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 action plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the Platform dealt with the following four sub-groups: • risk management instruments; • influencing the behaviour of taxpayers; • evaluation; • updating the risk management guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports from the "Risk Management Instruments" subgroups and "Updating the Risk Management Guide" were published at the beginning of 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The question of the conditions for UST registration and its deletion in various countries has been dealt with at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218 / 92 provides for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database</seg>
<seg id="191">This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="192">The registration and deletion issues are, until later, reserved for the national legislation of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">There was still a need for clarification and clarification in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Federal Audit Court recommended that the Federal Ministry of Finance should not fall short of the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">The final version of the draft was agreed by the Member States in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="196">Common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons are no longer included.</seg>
<seg id="197">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="198">The two courts deplore this. They continue to believe that such rules are important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly ZM levy</seg>
<seg id="201">With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous examination, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in the case of intra-Community transactions has reduced the turmoil for the submission of the relevant</seg>
<seg id="203">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the revision of the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not implement the obligation to make a monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010, and therefore not within the time limit, while the CZ complied with EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Matching the data of the UST pre-notifications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and thinking about merging the previously separate procedures for issuing the UST pre-notifications and the ZM respectively</seg>
<seg id="206">The German Treasury has taken on board the recommendations of the Federal Audit Court and set up a working group to draw up possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">The Federal Audit Court focused on German participation in the Risk Management Platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Inspection of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">The first audit examined jointly transactions in which there were doubts as to whether they had actually been exported or whether they had been found to be inconsistent in the declarations made by taxable persons in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the purposes of the audit, in which the tax audit by the FSA of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">A Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth EUR 22 686 from a German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his UST declaration because the German taxpayer had no UST identification number, but only one tax number for intra-German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="218">By providing international assistance under Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that under German US law the supplier of intra-Community goods would not be able to use the intra-Community VAT identification number to:</seg>
<seg id="219">On the basis of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, it was found that, according to the examination of the Czech competent FA, the Czech taxable person submitted an additional UST declaration declaring the purchase of goods at the same</seg>

<seg id="221">A Czech taxpayer is expected to have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">However, he stated that he had not acquired the goods and therefore did not declare it in his UST declaration.</seg>
<seg id="223">On the basis of a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German Treasury refused to deal with the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech FA has not been able to obtain any documentation, the tax audit has been unsuccessful and the original tax determination has been maintained.</seg>
<seg id="225">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA from Germany received two spontaneous information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxable person had invoked the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and declared the acquisition in his regular USt declaration for October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">(3)</seg>
<seg id="228">A Czech taxpayer is expected to have purchased a car worth EUR 48 500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, he did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="230">Moreover, he had not made a UST statement since August 2004. Therefore, the FA fixed the USt at 0 CZK for the quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="231">However, on the basis of information supplied from Germany as part of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the FA requested taxable persons in March 2007 to submit a post-tax return, which the</seg>
<seg id="232">The audit found that, in 2007, the FA had carried out further audits in this tax case. It found that the car in question had been sold by the taxable person to a second-hand car dealer in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the tax period December 2004, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="234">The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings concerning the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is unlikely to be recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">(4)</seg>
<seg id="237">A Czech taxpayer is expected to have supplied new cars (cars) to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 for a total value of EUR 198 167.</seg>
<seg id="238">In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, it was stated that a tax penalty procedure was pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">The Court's audit showed that, at the end of the procedure, there was evidence that the German taxpayer was involved in fraud.</seg>
<seg id="240">Intra-Community acquisitions of goods were subject to labour taxation at EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud with new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="242">Based on information from the German tax administration, an UST audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA established an additional UST of 703 031 CZK for May 2005 and 726 551 CZK for June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">(5)</seg>

<seg id="246">In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer is expected to have delivered a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech taxpayer B. B, however, contested the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had acquired the machine from a German company established in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech taxable person A did not declare the acquisition of the goods by the German taxable person in its UST declaration.</seg>
<seg id="249">The German FA's reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 showed that the German taxable person had not made an intra-Community supply of a machine worth EUR 58 000, but a supply within the</seg>
<seg id="250">In the audit, the Federal Audit Court found that, after an audit had been completed, the intra-Community supply of the machine was classified as domestic supply and the exemption from the UST was subsequently refused.</seg>

<seg id="252">A German taxpayer will have delivered goods worth EUR 11 600 to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had carried out its assessment on the basis of a supplementary UST declaration which wrongly rejected acquisition from another Member State, including the acquisition in the above Member State.</seg>
<seg id="255">On receipt of a reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German accounting office found that the German FA corrected the USt declaration by the German taxpayer and fixed an additional US1</seg>
<seg id="256">In view of the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding USt assessment there, an investigation is under way.</seg>
<seg id="257">The ZM of the German taxpayer has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxable person who issued the ZM can correct it.</seg>
<seg id="258">(7)</seg>
<seg id="259">In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA received a request from the German Treasury for information on the purchase of a private car in February 2005 by a Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="260">Following an examination for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA fixed the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at 0 CZK and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech UST agent had been cancelled because it had not fulfilled its fiscal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="262">The Czech FA had sent the records to the Czech police.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxable person has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax decision.</seg>

<seg id="265">According to MIAS10, a German taxpayer supplied between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 goods to a Czech taxpayer for the total value of EUR 33 205, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community.</seg>
<seg id="266">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the disagreements.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer made repeated ex post UST declarations for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, the Czech FA could not clarify the difference in the amount of purchases of CZK 134 273 during the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. This was justified by the fact that turnover for individual quarters could not be allocated precisely and accepted the UST declarations issued.</seg>

<seg id="270">A German taxpayer delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">As part of the exchange of information between Member States under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA verified the actual value of the supply.</seg>
<seg id="273">The German answer to this question provided three invoices showing a total value of EUR 31 998, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition made by the Czech taxable person and the acquisition made by the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="274">According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer submitted a subsequent UST declaration for the tax period July 2004 following repeated reminders by the FA in January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="275">In this declaration, the taxable person simultaneously claimed his right to deduct input tax. Its liability for the tax period in question therefore remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures for the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the tax administrations in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including ex post US rebates or prepayments).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Examination of selected cases of risk-related intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET may be an important source of information to identify those liable to risk in the Member State of acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the relevant FA with the purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the first quarter of 2008, the CZ has included in the EUROCANET system information on sales and taxable suppliers considered to be at risk.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech taxable persons were selected for the audit:</seg>
<seg id="283">Which have been entered into EUROCANET by the tax administrations of other Member States, either as suppliers or purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="284">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German Treasury did not participate in the exchange of data on EUROCANET, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with a German UST identification number were classified as risky by the German Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit identified both normal commercial transactions and those where there was suspicion of carousel fraud or other UST fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">In the cases in question, the DGs exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">E.g. B.:</seg>
<seg id="289">• The FSS found no suspicion of risk-related transactions in the review of the early warning information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The taxable persons concerned were continuously monitored because their data were stored in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, the FEMs failed to prove that they had infringed the rules governing the calculation of the basis of assessment and the UST, despite the fact that they had failed to comply with</seg>
<seg id="292">• The audit of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxable persons did not cooperate with the FOs and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The relevant EDFs reviewed most of the risk-bearing taxpayers and transactions referred to in early warning reports from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="294">However, their ability to monitor risk-bearing transactions, especially so-called "missing traders," is limited.</seg>
<seg id="295">In particular, a pure examination of the documents can hardly prove the fraudulent behaviour of the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="296">Stricter requirements for the registration of taxpayers for UST purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would help to combat UST fraud.</seg>
<seg id="297">The taxable persons involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for the purposes of the UST, in order to prevent fictitious deliveries of goods throughout the EU or to impose on other taxable persons the right to be</seg>
<seg id="298">Where carousel fraud is suspected in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely to monitor the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="299">Member States may participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was considered by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 11 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by the creation of a Eurofisc network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Findings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The Federal Accounting Office evaluated the data available to the Federal Central Tax Office, including those from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">They served as a basis for the selection of six German taxable persons whose files were checked.</seg>
<seg id="304">Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Therefore, Germany has a passive status, that is to say it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal Government:</seg>
<seg id="307">There is no dubious legal basis [there] which would allow the existing tax secrecy in Germany to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET. "12</seg>
<seg id="309">The German FSS receives control messages on the direct commercial relations of the taxable persons registered with them with companies from other EU countries covered by EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the other EU Member State mentioned above has business relations with an undertaking established in another Member State, which is also in business contact with the German company from the control message.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="314">Accordingly, the audit had to be carried out differently in this area.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, significant differences in the success of detecting UST fraud have not been identified. This is because EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, the financial administrations of both countries have a large number of other instruments to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation establishing Eurofisc, a network to combat US fraud.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by the Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="320">The cases brought to court at national and European level show that there is a need for a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for the exemption of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 Interstate assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:</seg>
<seg id="324">Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures which form part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund</seg>
<seg id="326">Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed rules for the application of certain Articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain taxes, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">The CZ transposed Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC by Law No 252 / 2000 on mutual assistance in the recovery of certain claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, this also had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, it was necessary to amend the abovementioned law.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, Decree-Law No 191 / 2004 on mutual assistance in the recovery of certain claims was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new relevant legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Annexes to this Regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the Regulation makes electronic transmission compulsory and obliges the requesting authority to certify that all documents sent correspond to the original in question.</seg>
<seg id="332">The main principles of international mutual assistance in the recovery of claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. The principle of reciprocity applies;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. Assistance shall always be provided only on application and on fulfilment of all the conditions;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. Assistance shall not cover claims considered to be a criminal sanction in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. The procedure for intergovernmental mutual assistance in the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. Assistance shall be granted only in order to recover undisputed claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. The principle of exhaustion applies: The requesting State must use all the means at its disposal under national law to recover the claim.</seg>
<seg id="340">Law 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: Provision of information, service of acts and actual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The relevant FA shall request information, the request for notification of acts or the request for recovery, together with the relevant documents, to be sent electronically via the relevant financial directorate to the CZ's Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="343">The CZ's Ministry of Finance translates the request into the language in question, scans it with all facilities and transmits it via the communications network or the CCN / CSI common interface to the competent financial authority of the State.</seg>
<seg id="344">A request for recovery aid must satisfy the following condition: The claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be more than five years old.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for requests received from other Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">The CZ's Ministry of Finance must acknowledge receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible and within seven days at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">If it decides not to accept the request, it shall inform the applicant authority of the reasons for its refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the Directive on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="349">The corresponding notification shall be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the acknowledgement of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">On receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance examines whether the request meets all legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="351">It will then send the request to the relevant FA through the financial directorate concerned. If the request for recovery is accepted, the FA shall, inter alia, determine the assets of the debtor, e.g. B. Extracts from the basic book, information on existing bank accounts and registration of motor vehicles at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="352">On the expiry of six months from the date of receipt of the receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="353">The requesting authority shall be informed even if the taxable persons concerned are not attainable and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="354">All sums successfully recovered shall be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech FA involved in the recovery may, with the agreement of the requesting State, agree on the hours to be paid or the instalments to be paid.</seg>
<seg id="356">Interest or surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of delay pursuant to Law No 337 / 1992 concerning the administration of taxes and charges</seg>
<seg id="357">Shall be the responsibility of the requesting State.</seg>
<seg id="358">In 2006 and 2007 in particular, the Ministry of Finance delayed the submission of requests for recovery to the CZ to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="359">The same applies to the forwarding of requests for recovery made by the Czech FSA to the competent authority in the requested State.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit showed that the Ministry of Finance infringed the law on inter-state assistance for the recovery of claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of the recovery procedure within six months of the confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="361">The situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">According to Article 13 (4) of Law 191 / 2004, the CZ's Ministry of Finance produces statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This shall include the number of requests for information, notification of acts and recovery received during the previous year, including the amount of the claims.</seg>
<seg id="364">On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission shall prepare its report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit showed that the CZ's Ministry of Finance underestimated the claims by EUR 5 250 000 in 2008. The reason for this was the erroneous indication of the level of a US claim made in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal commas in the conversion of the claim from Czech kroner into euro).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was then reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>

<seg id="369">The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="370">In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">It covers, inter alia, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and wealth, including associated interest, fees and value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Law (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the Tax Code (AO).</seg>
<seg id="374">Article 117 (2) of the AO provides that the financial authorities may provide inter national legal and administrative assistance under international treaties and national law applicable to the European Communities, as well as under the EC Code of Administrative Assistance.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of the AO (§ 249-346) contains the law governing the enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative action of the tax authorities shall cover, in particular, the order for enforcement and enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Finance Authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Tax Office (18).</seg>
<seg id="378">The general conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="379">• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (§ 251, 254 AO).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All domestic means of recovery have been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• The claims for which mutual assistance is requested are uncountervailable.</seg>
<seg id="382">• The period between the issue of the enforcing title or the date on which the claim or title became uncountervailable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The requirement must be at least EUR 1 500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States German requests for recovery of withholding taxes are made by the enforcement agencies of the FSA through the competent mediation authority and the Federal Central Office for Taxation of the foreign authority concerned, e.g. Such as the Czech CLO.</seg>

<seg id="402">4.4.3 Examination of selected cases of recovery</seg>
<seg id="403">A total of 21 interstate recovery requests were selected for the audit between the CZ and Germany. Ten cases are listed below, including:</seg>
<seg id="404">The following was noted:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for US debt from a Czech taxpayer in 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3 883 (CZK 109 820).</seg>
<seg id="407">Only on 26 February 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the request for recovery to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA imposed a property belonging to the taxable person with a property right.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since the burdened land was not sufficient to cover all the tax liability, a rate payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was concluded with the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="410">An interim report was submitted to the German FA on 31 August 2009. As a result, in the meantime, the taxpayer had paid CZK 49 600 (as at 25 August 2009).</seg>
<seg id="411">The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly afterwards, on 28 August 2009, a further 3 000 CZK was transferred.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax debts (USt, income tax) and interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling EUR 180 869 (= EUR 4 434).</seg>
<seg id="414">Only on 27 November 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the request for recovery to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="415">After verifying bank assets, securities, immovable property, motor vehicles and other movable property, the FA found that the debtor did not have indemnible assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">On-the-spot investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">Its location in the CZ was unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded it to the German Treasury on 16 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for UST, together with interest and fees totalling 3 139 euro (= 84 846 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="421">Only on 6 August 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the request for recovery to the relevant FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech taxpayer had now paid the debt.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech taxpayer had completely paid his debt in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the debt was also paid in the CZ during the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to the long time taken by the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxable person himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the Federal Audit Court, it was found that the amount recovered would be offset against the tax liability arising from another procedure, amounting to EUR 6 649, which should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the documentation of the Czech Ministry of Finance, the company concerned received only a request for recovery of EUR 3 139. The request for recovery of EUR 6 649 was not found there.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, UST, interest and fees totalling EUR 39 957 = CZK 956 654.</seg>
<seg id="429">Only on 19 December 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the request for recovery to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="430">The recovery procedure started on 1 June 2009. A decision has been taken to pledge the Czech bank credit and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and considered the amount to be contentious.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech FA, the debtor had in the past been prepared to pay EUR 250 per month, but the relevant German FA did not agree with this.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxable person agreed to discuss his case with the German FA in order to agree on another amount.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax for 2005 and USt for the years 2003 to 2007 plus interest and fees totalling EUR 113 444 = EUR 3 116.</seg>
<seg id="437">It was only on 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to FA Prague 1, which has not been authorised to deal with tax cases in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="438">In its investigation, the FA received information and documentation on 19 September 2008 indicating that the debtor's income was EUR 4 704. However, it could not issue an order for enforcement because the request for recovery had been received after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an order for the enforcement of the debtor's assets with credit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested inter-state assistance in the recovery of a UST debt and procedural costs of a total of CZK 146 223 742.</seg>
<seg id="443">Only on 13 May 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the request for recovery to the German Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA transferred to the Czech authorities, via the Bundesbank, the sum of EUR 17 700 - 439 226 - accrued by the deposit of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="445">A translation error was detected in the verification of the amounts recovered.</seg>
<seg id="446">The amount to be recovered of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at the exchange rate of 1 euro = CZK 25.065, but a compromise error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct amount to be recovered was EUR 5 833 782.</seg>
<seg id="448">As a result, a request for recovery, which was reduced by EUR 5 250 404, was submitted.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery for a US debt plus interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer amounting to a total of CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847</seg>
<seg id="451">Only on 10 November 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the German Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="452">The German FA ordered the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.</seg>
<seg id="453">Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008, and in particular in the first half of 2009, and the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to cover the overdue tax liability. On 8 April 2009 - EUR 4 600, on 6 May 2009 - EUR -3 000 and on 16 June 2009 - EUR 2 500.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of a total of 398 653 euros = CZK 9 832 779, which included, inter alia, real estate tax.</seg>
<seg id="458">Only on 2 October 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the German Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="459">A letter from the German Treasury to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009 sent the request back.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration argued that the basic advertising tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">(G) Liabilities arising from taxes on income and wealth.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and wealth not referred to in Article 1 (3) and (4) of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed that a new recovery request should be sent to the German tax administration, which should no longer include the real estate tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but the US corporation tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the relevant FA for recovery of tax debts of the same taxable person amounting to CZK 7 079 735.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA sent to the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and USt amounting to a total of CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328.</seg>
<seg id="467">The US debt was 1 133 967 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="468">Only on 18 April 2007 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the German Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="469">And only on 11 November 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance send to the Czech FA the German Treasury's reply of 9 July 2007,</seg>
<seg id="470">According to the German FA, on 11 June 2007, an order for the enforcement of the bank account had been issued. The Bank stated that it was not in direct contact with the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="471">The request was therefore deemed to have been dealt with by the German Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent to the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for US debt amounting to a total of CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The relevant Financial Directorate sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German Treasury on 15 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Prior to the submission of the request, the Czech FA carried out the tax claim by pledging the accounts with banks and salaries and by charging a property.</seg>
<seg id="477">Prior to the request for recovery, an information request was sent to the German Treasury on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">According to the reply of 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer was domiciled in Germany and had income from independent activity amounting to EUR 8 437. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the request for recovery and only forwarded it to the competent Czech FA on 12 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="479">He proposed that the Court should reply as follows:</seg>
<seg id="480">No property had been established that income from independent activities was already the subject of other enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German Treasury therefore considered the request to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the area of recovery, the rules of EU law apply to all EU Member States for mutual assistance.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for handling requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">Federal Court of Justice and NKDP have compared the statistics transmitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">There was disagreement in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that the Member States compile their statistics with greater care.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 200921, the Commission concluded that despite a greater number of requests for assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics have narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both audit offices consider it useful to have a further discussion at EU level on statistics in order to avoid the remaining discrepancies in the future.</seg>
<seg id="490">If this is not done, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics reflect both the annual number of requests and the nature of the claims (e.g. VAT, personal income tax) and the amount of amounts recovered per Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">By analysing the statistics presented by the Member States more closely, the Commission could assist the Member States in evaluating their measures to combat UST fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors are in favour of Member States with a low rate at least seeking the average recovery rate within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.</seg>
<seg id="495">The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance (CZ) were forwarded delayed to the relevant EDFs, particularly in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="496">The same applies to requests for recovery made by the Czech FSO.</seg>
<seg id="497">The examination showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance infringed Law No 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance in so far as the competent authority of the requesting Member State did not, within the six-month period from the date of receipt,</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Value Added Tax Examination for Large Companies</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Turnover tax audit for large enterprises in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General</seg>
<seg id="501">The taxation procedure for large enterprises is governed by the same rules as apply to other taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="502">The examination of large enterprises is governed by Czech Law No 337 / 1992, the Tax and Fees Administration Act.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been set up for the purpose of carrying out a business and whose net turnover for the tax period in question is at least 2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="504">The taxable person is considered to be a large enterprise on the basis of the level of turnover. Income or corporation tax returns are classified during the tax period concerned; for the first time in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A natural or legal person is no longer run as a large business for the purposes of turnover tax if, during three consecutive tax periods, its net turnover during the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period shall begin at the end of the tax period for which the tax is payable for the first time. Declaration and date for submission:</seg>
<seg id="506">A taxable person may be removed from the list of large establishments only if at least one type of tax for a tax period has been examined beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="507">By the end of 2009, all large holdings were audited at least every five years.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, taxable persons have been assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on the proper setting and collection of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="509">The audits carried out by the FSS are intended to focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="510">The major taxable holdings were audited by the special auditing bodies or auditing services of the relevant FSS, set up at a total of 13 FSS.</seg>
<seg id="511">A special audit body carried out audits in accordance with the rules laid down by the Head of the Financial Directorate in its local area of competence.</seg>
<seg id="512">It also examined:</seg>
<seg id="513">Tax payable by Persons with an unusual and special business activity, and</seg>
<seg id="514">Those whose examination required a high level of expertise and time.</seg>
<seg id="515">It also examines tax-payers with complex location distribution and organisational structure.</seg>
<seg id="516">Tax payable by Persons suspected of large-scale tax evasion</seg>
<seg id="517">As well as taxable persons belonging to chains and networks suspected of major tax evasion and unjustified deduction.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information on the number of audits carried out by the FSS's Special Audit Bodies and the additional tax results of these audits is given in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law 531 / 1990 for the regional tax authorities. In particular, the establishment of a special tax office with national competence for selected taxable persons (legal persons established for the purpose of economic activity) will have a turnover of at least: 2 billion CZK).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Value Added Tax Examination for Large Companies in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General</seg>
<seg id="522">The US audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. Operational audits are governed by the general rules: • the Tax Order (AO); • the Financial Management Act (FVG); and • the Operational Audit Order (BPO).</seg>
<seg id="523">There are also working aids.</seg>
<seg id="524">Tax REGULATIONS</seg>
<seg id="525">The provisions of § § 193 to 203 of the AO "Section 4 - External audit" contain, in particular, rules on the admissibility of an external audit and its substantive scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the audit</seg>
<seg id="526">External audits are carried out by the relevant DGs (§ 195 AO).</seg>
<seg id="527">Under Article 5 (1) of the Finance Administration Act, in conjunction with Article 19, it is for the Federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits of the FSA.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and extent of such participation shall be agreed between the authorities concerned.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office may require that certain establishments which it renounces be inspected at a given time.</seg>
<seg id="530">In that case, it may lay down rules for the external auditing of such taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="531">In accordance with Article 108 (7) of the GG, the Examination Order (BPO 2000) was adopted with the approval of the Bundesrat.</seg>
<seg id="532">It applies to external audits of the Land Finance Authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">According to § 3 of the BPO, enterprises are regularly classified into size classes.</seg>
<seg id="534">A follow-up examination must be carried out by large firms (para. 4.2 BPO).</seg>
<seg id="535">In accordance with paragraph 33.1 of the BPO, each competent tax authority must keep a group register within the meaning of the provision.</seg>
<seg id="536">Administrative working aids</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the following working aids were issued for the administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">• "Single Manual for the US Special Audit";</seg>
<seg id="539">• Turnover tax countries online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with guidance on the use of the data on intra-Community commercial relations contained in the MIAS;</seg>
<seg id="540">• Work aids for difficult and special situations.</seg>
<seg id="541">• Central database for the storage and evaluation of UST fraud and the development of risk profiles - ZAUBER;</seg>
<seg id="542">Taxable persons are classified into size classes. These are based on criteria such as turnover and profit, with limits varying according to the branch of activity.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">The values shall be reviewed every three years and fixed for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of enterprises - not only large enterprises - can be seen on a regular basis (last reference date: 1 January 2010).</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, large enterprises must be examined in a complete manner.</seg>
<seg id="547">The audits are announced and, as a general rule, include the UST,</seg>
<seg id="548">In other words, the audit covers all relevant taxes: Income tax, corporation tax, business tax and USt.</seg>
<seg id="549">The turnover tax may be examined either by company auditors or by special UST auditors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of each country.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">BPO 2000 starts from three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">The examination shall be subject to all taxes on which an undertaking was assessed.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit of large enterprises</seg>
<seg id="555">In accordance with the terms of the agreement, the two audit offices did not examine any individual cases. You have looked at how the tax administrations operate in the UST audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="556">With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the Treasury which is essential for the audit of large enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and evaluations are available to the management of the tax administration for the UST audit of large enterprises?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between the fight against fraud and the general investigation of fraud?</seg>
<seg id="560">CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat UST fraud and general UST audits.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there statistics or records of the time close to the examinations?</seg>
<seg id="563">CZ: Data on the timing of intra-Community acquisitions of selected taxable persons are included in the ATIS system;</seg>
<seg id="564">The same applies to information on the start and end of the audit of the FA.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the federal statistics for auditors contain only information on the so-called average last audit period (year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.</seg>
<seg id="567">UST special auditors focus on the last UST apportionment periods and are also empowered to audit large companies.</seg>
<seg id="568">The statistics for special UST auditors at federal level do not include data on the size class of the farm audited.</seg>
<seg id="569">• provide statistics or records of the nature of the multiple result; e.g. B. Breakdown according to:</seg>
<seg id="570">I. Real increase (e.g. B. Application of a reduced rate instead of the general UST rate)</seg>
<seg id="571">II. Unreal additional result (e.g. B. Transfer / relocation of a case not to be objected to under turnover tax law to another period of taxation)</seg>
<seg id="572">III. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)</seg>
<seg id="573">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech Treasury monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the additional tax result broken down by type of tax, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, reminder procedures) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Independent of this, the amount of repayments and incoming payments are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics on tax debt are presented by type of tax. However, no distinction is made between tax debts arising from a tax declaration and those arising from audit activities carried out by the FA.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the federal statistics for auditors and special auditors do not differ according to the criteria mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="579">Nor did most fiscal authorities carrying out local surveys differentiate in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are significant areas of audit recorded?</seg>
<seg id="581">CZ: Yes, the FA can select audit cases on the basis of criteria associated with selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="583">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level do not provide such information for auditors and special UST auditors.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, the Federal and Länder Finance Ministries have agreed on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="585">This means that auditors and tax-payers in the countries will have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold value is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, additional information should be provided, e.g. B. the origin of the additional UST results obtained.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="589">- the taxable large companies have unjustifiably used the deduction of input tax on related supplies and services,</seg>
<seg id="590">• which have not been used for an entrepreneurial activity under § 72 (1) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="591">• used for representation expenses under § 75 (3) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="592">• invoices which do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG</seg>
<seg id="593">- large taxable undertakings have failed to comply with the notification of USt to be paid provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="595">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level do not provide such information for auditors and special UST auditors.</seg>
<seg id="596">Findings on the USt from examinations carried out by large firms are not covered separately by the countries.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, the Federal Central Tax Office may evaluate the Zauber database in which auditors and tax-payers of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Are financial management analysing fruitful audit fields and implications for strategic governance?</seg>
<seg id="599">CZ: Yes, e.g. For example, national audits are carried out for risk-bearing goods and industries.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="601">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level do not provide information on particularly "profitable" audit fields for auditors and USt auditors.</seg>
<seg id="602">As regards the analysis of such information, the benefits and the way in which they are used, different views were expressed at the survey centres.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some Sub-Finance Directorates provide such information to the NSIs, but they are free to use it or not.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">As a result, large quantities of information are processed automatically in the CZ. For example, data from UST audits, as well as data from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts in the system are processed.</seg>
<seg id="606">The CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases on the basis of a wide range of information.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the evaluation and management of UST audits in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">The CZ is planning to set up a Special Finance Agency for Large Companies for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="610">Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="611">The emphasis is more on the selection of individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="612">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of the information contained in UST pre-declarations or UST declarations as well as audit reports, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.</seg>
<seg id="614">In order to reduce UST revenue losses and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs, appropriate management processes and risk management systems should be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="615">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="616">THISSEGMENTISINTENTIONAL LEFT BLACK</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of the two audit offices has proved its worth.</seg>
<seg id="619">• Intra-Community transactions; • risk management at the UST, in particular with regard to the selection of risk-based transactions;</seg>
<seg id="620">The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting UST fraud and in the systems described above.</seg>
<seg id="621">These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="622">They can also be used to stimulate discussion among interested bodies on the ways in which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud. This applies to e.g. For example, for relations within and between Member States and the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The experience and knowledge gained should encourage us to continue to examine the management of the UST together in the future.</seg>
