<seg id="3">High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising living standards in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economic passenger and freight transport is an important task for the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="6">It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.</seg>
<seg id="7">When setting up and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures, the construction of the transport infrastructure is complex.</seg>
<seg id="9">When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify deficiencies that stand in the way of optimum economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit authorities should not only inform the administrations of the shortcomings identified, but also provide them with suggestions for improvement for the benefit of citizens and for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ), carried out parallel audits of expenditure for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (D8 motorway in the Czech Republic and A17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The two highways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by the two states.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the course of cooperation with the BRH, the NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">In line with the planning progress, the date of completion was finally set for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the award procedure, the Road and Highway Administration of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">For this, however, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint audit work, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.</seg>
<seg id="24">A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis showed that the border bridge under the major bridges with lengths of over 100 m was the most expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of the delays in awarding contracts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The comparison of the prices of the tunnel structures showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">In future audits of the cost-effectiveness of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH and NKÚ will be able to rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both courts of auditors recommend that bridge constructions be standardised and that steel composite and special constructions only be carried out where prestressed concrete constructions are unsuitable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The examination process was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report deals with the parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The focus of the audit was on economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel tests were carried out by BRH in Germany and NKÚ in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="36">In the years 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The NKÚ examined the economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of expenditure on the cross-border section 0807 of the D8 motorway amounting to approx. CZK 20 billion gross (approx. € 690 million).</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million will come from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A17 of approx. €670 million, €277 million will be co-financed by the European Fund (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden – Central and Southeastern Europe – Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech/German border,</seg>
<seg id="43">The A 17 from the border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the inspection, the sections of the motorways near the border were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">Here the crossing of a landscape protection area in the Bohemian Central Uplands is planned.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the volume of traffic in 2008 on section 0807 of the D8 motorway near the border will amount to 22,940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 25,000 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded an agreement on the merger of the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border through the construction of a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction measure represented an important aspect of the parallel audits of both courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="53">From mid-2005, the two courts of auditors jointly considered cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Construction Administration.</seg>
<seg id="58">There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The NKÚ had no comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly in view of the overall construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The NKÚ also had to assess the effectiveness of the expenditure by examining the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory negotiations, the Presidents of the two Courts of Auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of inspections of the Prague-Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="64">The auditors of both Courts of Auditors met in the course of 2006 at intervals of about six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for checking bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results on the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">A key aspect of the cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH mainly focused on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal bases for financial control differ, as does the way in which the two courts of auditors complete their audits.</seg>
<seg id="69">For this reason, both authorities drew up separate national reports on their audit results.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report takes into account the results of the two parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation will end with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge if possible in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">They later postponed the date by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as the client of the construction project.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany is co-financing the bridge construction to 42.13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">Initially, the RMD envisaged a prestressed concrete construction for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, however, the RMD agreed with its German partner on the construction of a steel composite structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">They justified this decision with the possible reduction in the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the floodplain.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had shown the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, this was due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">Serious errors were made by the RMD during the award procedure,</seg>
<seg id="85">By insufficiently preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.</seg>
<seg id="86">These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Evaluation Commission and the Director General of the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="87">A losing bidder challenged the outcome of the tender process.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation by the Czech Cartel Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a result, the following summer construction season in 2004 was lost and the total construction time available was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, which led to a significant price increase.</seg>
<seg id="91">The measures offered included the double assembly of the superstructures, the change of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally intended type of steel.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new steel grade – whose higher costs of around €4 million were borne by the client alone – made it possible to shorten the construction time planned for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the offer price of around €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further additions will significantly increase the overall construction costs of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of around €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">Without price guidance, costs are currently around € 25.9 million net (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both courts of auditors examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges that were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="101">When preparing this part of the examination, a precise definition of the price concept was important.</seg>
<seg id="102">For the comparison of the bridge prices, both courts of auditors agreed on detailed specifications, for example: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="103">(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change.) not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion. (29 CZK = 1 €).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of various types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and of various sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.</seg>
<seg id="106">The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The study showed that the m2 price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per square metre.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see figures below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two bridges with a significantly higher price could be found on the A 17 and four on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges were determined partly by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (based on the distance to the regression curve, atypically expensive bridges can be identified).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the respective high price must be determined in each individual case.</seg>
<seg id="115">This could be due, for example, to uneconomic administrative action, but also to the requirements for the protection of the environment or other legitimate reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length expected the Czech concrete bridges to be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">This was also supported by the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">During joint discussions, two reasons for this situation were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="122">This also enables medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.</seg>
<seg id="124">Orders of this magnitude cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">The variety of bridge structures built in the Czech Republic is greater than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the NKÚ noted that the construction of bridges is determined long before the start of construction,</seg>
<seg id="128">And already with the submission of the application for planning approval by the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this point in time, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, cost-effectiveness plays a subordinate role in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">Only by means of a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would it have been possible to reach a final conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have gone beyond the scope of this examination.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The significant price differences may be the result of under-developed competition for tunnelling in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow any general conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Economic efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden – Prague motorway</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">It was planned to gradually extend the D 8 from Prague to the border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section 0805 was to be built through the Bohemian Central Uplands before section 0807 near the border.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic is financing D8 as part of the programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">The programme number 327 220 “Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – Czech German state border” defines two objectives:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">As a national objective: to improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">As an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.</seg>
<seg id="147">The programme provided for the construction of the section through the Central Bohemian Mountains to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of section 0807 near the border to be completed in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical with the time of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The NKÚ noted that the planning approval decision had already been issued for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental groups have taken legal action against this decision.</seg>
<seg id="151">A final judgment is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="152">Compared to the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, a delay of several years in the completion of section No. 0805 could therefore not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed that the completion date of section 0805 be postponed to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result, the construction of the section near the border did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD carried out an economic assessment of section No. 0807 of the D 8 near the border and section No. 0805 through the Bohemian Central Uplands between 1999 and 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The investment cost was approximately € 639 million for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the profitability analysis (EIRR = internal rate of interest)</seg>
<seg id="158">Variant Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Traffic volume in the northern part of the section near the border was 22,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic feasibility study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section running through the Bohemian Central Uplands would be subject to traffic at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the examination, it was obvious that the section through the Central Bohemian Mountains would not be opened on the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The costs of both sections as at 31 December 2005 were €897 million excluding VAT and thus 27.4 % higher than in the economic assessment of 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different, more complex domestic route, which would affect the economic viability of the project.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic analysis showed that the construction of both motorway sections is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Central Bohemian Mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="171">A higher volume of traffic on the routes, which are to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Uplands, is highly likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic feasibility study.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the section of the D 8 near the border will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the section of the D 8 near the border is therefore uneconomical.</seg>
<seg id="174">The construction of the A 17 also led to cost increases, as with the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport assumed investment costs of around €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">It thus determined a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit/cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">The BRH had examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">He noted that the authority responsible for the approval requested an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the Road Construction Administration of the superfluousness of the landscape tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="181">This avoided €10 million in construction costs and €150,000 in annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">When examining the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was insufficiently prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">In the planning phase, the road construction administration refrained from recording the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschener Wand, as it was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">Only when the tunnelling reached the wall did she catch up.</seg>
<seg id="186">This showed that the rock was more weathered than assumed in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">Complex measures such as moorings, injections and rockfall protection nets for around €3.3 million were necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional, already necessary services such as securing the Dölzschener Wand, but also for those that would not have been necessary for proper construction preparation.</seg>
<seg id="189">These include expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the tunnelling team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of the construction period (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million is not offset by any lasting added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to make better use of its specialist supervision for major road construction measures.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, it should be urgent for the road construction administrations to introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Advantages of the cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation met the expectations of both courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH received findings on the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both courts of auditors developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.</seg>
<seg id="196">The NKÚ noted that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadway of the D 8 do not differ from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of both Courts of Auditors involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience which will be useful in future audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Preface</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the Courts of Auditors have the power to audit all public finances.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration requires that the Court of Auditors must have the power to examine tax collection to the greatest extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Organisation of European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national audit institutions can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit institutions of other states.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example could be the examination of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to a significant loss of revenue in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Cooperation between the authorities is necessary in the fight against such crimes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Court of Auditors that audit in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea for an audit of VAT and the MIAS system originated at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the course of thorough preparation, the participating courts of auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the examination subjects for the examination planning.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.</seg>

<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter “EC”) with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">(DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.</seg>
<seg id="28">VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (“NKÚ”) and the Federal Court of Auditors (“BRH”) of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between tax administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the focus on the exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary notifications.</seg>
<seg id="35">The audit also covered the legal situation with regard to cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is exceeding the turnover threshold laid down in the Value Added Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number that is only valid for domestic transactions for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.</seg>
<seg id="42">As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is free of VAT, but there is a right to deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the transport service, insofar as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">Whereas in the Czech Republic, taxable persons only have to file VAT returns for tax periods during the year (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly)</seg>
<seg id="49">Pre-register for sales tax and submit an annual sales tax return after the end of the calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="50">In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxable persons in Germany must submit their VAT pre-registration electronically.</seg>
<seg id="51">The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="52">4) Summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="53">While taxpayers in the Czech Republic must submit their Summary Reports to the tax offices (FÄ), German taxpayers must submit the Summary Reports to the ClO2.</seg>
<seg id="54">Accordingly, the FAs in the Czech Republic have access to the information from the summary notifications as soon as they have been filed.</seg>
<seg id="55">For German FÄ, the data from the Summary Reports are only available after they have been processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="56">In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="57">The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of the turnover and the update of the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="58">This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same time limits.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor processing times.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German financial administration dealt with a significantly lower percentage of the requests for information received within the specified period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended constant monitoring of the deadlines to the German CLO (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, the two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions between Czech and German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="69">Of these, 31 cases were reviewed jointly using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The Court of Auditors found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the taxable persons had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or had not reported the purchase of goods in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="76">A number of cases have been uncovered in which taxpayers misreported transactions in their summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in the MIAS were accordingly incorrect, so that the clerks (of the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="79">Examination procedures in the CR</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II – “State Budget Revenue” and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, North-West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">Audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The NKÚ College approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Examination procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The examination was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase, the actual testing began in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was conducted in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files from the following cases were included in the audit:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.</seg>
<seg id="92">Talks were also held with FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">The results of the audit were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors</seg>
<seg id="95">Several meetings of representatives of both courts of auditors took place in the run-up to the parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the financial administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in the respective other country.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel examinations: 1.</seg>
<seg id="100">Registration of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach – legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of tax officials in the processing of requests for information and the review of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary Reports.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. Risk management in the VAT area.</seg>
<seg id="110">At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the already achieved results of the parallel examinations.</seg>

<seg id="118">An entrepreneur with a registered office, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months is obliged to pay on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (Section 94 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter “Act No. 235/2004”).</seg>
<seg id="119">The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he/she has exceeded the registration threshold.</seg>
<seg id="120">Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxpayer if he has exceeded the application deadline for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">An entrepreneur with a registered office, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million but meets other requirements specified in Act No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="122">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the requirements specified in the law may voluntarily apply for VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="123">Upon receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer, the registration procedure begins in accordance with Act No. 337/1992.</seg>
<seg id="124">Anyone who wants to register voluntarily for value added tax must indicate in his application the cut-off date from which he applies for registration as a person subject to value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax official must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all attachments.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="127">If the tax official has determined by verification that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written opinion on the registration and the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="128">In the notification, the tax officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for value added tax and the assessment period for value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="129">The assessment period is the calendar quarter; unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="130">If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the tax officer of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The issue of a tax number in the registration notice always has a constitutive character.</seg>
<seg id="133">The taxpayer must provide the tax number in any communication (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where this is required by a special law (e.g. Act No. 235/2004, concerning the issuance of tax documents)3.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as this is determined by a special law. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions in § 33 (12) of Act No. 337/1992).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite being requested to do so by the tax official, the local tax official has to register him ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="137">A notification will also be issued, which will be sent to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to conduct a business receives a tax number for any type of tax when they register for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="139">This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">In accordance with Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the obligation to register VAT, the tax officer may require the taxable person to collect up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover, which the person concerned has made unlawfully without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person, up to the date on which the registration as a taxable person was made by order of the tax officer (Section 98 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount fixed in this way is considered a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a person subject to VAT can be deleted for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of the registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="145">A taxpayer may request the cancellation of his registration no earlier than one year after the effective date specified in the registration notice.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Deletion of the registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Act No. 235/2004), if: a) the taxable person has not performed for a period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax official of the reasons for this, b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under Act No. 235/2004, c) the previous taxable person no longer meets the requirements for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Taxpayers without legal domicile, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have his legal domicile, place of business or place of business in the Czech Republic, or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries in accordance with § 108 of Act No. 235/2004 (“non-resident entrepreneur”) becomes liable to tax when providing the service in question.</seg>
<seg id="148">He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.</seg>
<seg id="149">He is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT numbers allocated to him in other Member States or third countries.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 must register him retroactively, as he became liable for VAT on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic in accordance with Act No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the event of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require the companies concerned to provide proof (invoices or written explanations) as proof of performance.</seg>
<seg id="152">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, FA Prague 1 must request the presentation of the performance-related contract documents.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Act No. 235/2004, the tax officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on 31 January of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or declarations and to pay tax.</seg>
<seg id="155">When examining the NKÚ, it turned out that if a tax return was filed by post and sent abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory cut-off date for filing a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA by 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, which are decisive for the possibility of deletion of the registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of taxable persons in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In accordance with the provisions of the tax regulations (§§ 137, 138 AO), every business must be registered with the municipality and/or the responsible tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">This registration must be made no later than one month after commencement of business.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality forwards the application to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been started but not registered, it can also retroactively register the taxpayer ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="162">In Germany, taxable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register VAT for Zwekke if they meet the requirements in § 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">Special departments are responsible for entrepreneurs based abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="167">A total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered with it as of 30 April 2004; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.</seg>
<seg id="168">According to the findings of the BRH, these FAs with special competences often refused the registration of so-called sham self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed workers tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These (sham) self-employed persons do not meet the conditions specified in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they are usually dependent on a single client, who determines their working time and the type of work execution.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the responsible FA and provide information about the company and the business activities carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either in special organisational units within the FÄ or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="174">This form is used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer prior to the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, The following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, The following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control number.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="179">The VAT number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxpayer declares intra-Community deliveries in his prior VAT declarations or in his annual VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT number consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he ceases business), but only after completion of all tax transactions (investment of all financial years) or 2. if the financial administration determines that he no longer operates a business.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a rule, the validity of the VAT number depends on the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT number can be terminated there at that time.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the Value Added Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay value added tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 € and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of 50,000 € in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge other entrepreneurs VAT, nor to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they do not have to pay VAT, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small business owner can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration is binding for the following five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">He may then invoice the VAT and deduct the input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive the input tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="192">The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices must indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold specified in the Value Added Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences may occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically request the allocation of a VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-stage registration system can lead to significant misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which issue a single identification number both for national VAT registration and for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-stage system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business activities with the municipality or the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration enables an accurate assessment of value added tax for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules should be harmonised for the whole EC.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.</seg>
<seg id="208">This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to each natural person after birth.</seg>
<seg id="209">This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person takes up a business activity, the responsible FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="211">In future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on implementing an IT procedure for managing the numbers has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach</seg>
<seg id="214">Legal regulations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">In accordance with the provisions of § 70 of Law No. 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between individual Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="216">The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport is carried out by persons who are registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners who are taxable in their own country.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return journey is regarded as a separate transport process.</seg>
<seg id="218">If non-resident entrepreneurs do not carry out any economic activity in the Czech Republic other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">Cross-border passenger transport has been exempted from VAT in the Czech Republic by virtue of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5(1)(b), which reads as follows:</seg>
<seg id="220">"For the purpose of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F of the Directive, the Czech Republic may maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the requirement of Article 28(4) of the Directive is met or for as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."</seg>
<seg id="221">The legal regulations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.</seg>
<seg id="223">Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxable person travels through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany is deemed to be taxable transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before providing his services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="228">The latter registers it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus and coach named in the taxable person's registration.</seg>
<seg id="229">The entrepreneur must state his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport service is provided for an entrepreneur resident in Germany, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT to the FA himself.</seg>
<seg id="232">In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services must pay VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer, which is known as the ‘displacement of tax liability’ and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of checking the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable personal transport:</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad that are used to transport passengers through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each inspection, the mobile control groups transmit an inspection protocol to the responsible FA.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident taxpayer can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the FA or may use the means of administrative assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may request administrative assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to verify the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too costly in relation to the low income from VAT on taxable passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxpayer causes disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter must check the foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.</seg>
<seg id="243">Accordingly, a higher expenditure of time is to be expected for such an examination than for a resident taxpayer, although the examination is limited to passenger transport taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.</seg>
<seg id="245">Furthermore, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxable person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="246">This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation is different in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route applicable on German territory.</seg>
<seg id="251">If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA in advance.</seg>
<seg id="252">This registers the taxpayer, who must declare the taxable portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as their business purpose.</seg>
<seg id="255">The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States – which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system – have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of VAT assessment, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state in which the transport begins or in which the service provider is located.</seg>
<seg id="259">This type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">Unless otherwise stipulated by law, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax liability arises upon expiry of the deadline for submitting the value added tax return. Excluded from this regulation is the value added tax on the import of goods in accordance with Act No. 235/2004. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If there is a refund claim as a result of above-average deductible input taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the establishment of this deduction, without an application having to be made.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates tax proceedings with regard to the taxpayer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with § 73 (11) of Act No. 235/2004, the right to deduct input tax can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax arose.</seg>
<seg id="267">After expiry of this period, the deduction of input tax can still be claimed within three years after the end of the tax period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">An amendment to Act No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct input tax could have been claimed for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">A taxable person must file a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections by which the last known tax liability is not changed, but only previous information is changed, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with § 49 of Act No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">A taxable person can file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the relevant facts were established.</seg>
<seg id="273">The sales tax declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of a data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="274">Submission via the Internet can be made with or without a certified electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">If it is carried out without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carriers.</seg>
<seg id="276">The form for the VAT return contains separate lines indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.</seg>
<seg id="277">The value of purchased services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some sections are used for automated primary controls as part of the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as taxable persons is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their Summary Reports.</seg>
<seg id="280">The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered there as taxable persons is compared, with the help of MIAS, with the information provided in the summary declarations of taxable persons from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">As part of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check of the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="282">This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior check.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility check includes a calculation of the criteria for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Act No. 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this Act.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system – Automated tax information system used by Czech tax offices to provide technical support for tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="286">During its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person concerned in the event of non-delivery of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registration and the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are obliged to file VAT pre-registrations must nevertheless file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small business owners who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="291">Taxable persons are generally obliged to submit a pre-registration for value added tax by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the value added tax arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability amounted to more than €6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations at the latest by the 10th day after the end of the respective month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer can also decide to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has been reimbursed an amount of €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">If the annual value added tax does not amount to more than 512 €, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT returns must be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="295">A resulting VAT liability is payable 10 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="296">A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="297">(statutory) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.</seg>
<seg id="299">In principle, VAT returns, including refunds, must be processed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German Value Added Tax Act allows an extension of these (delivery or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment must be made.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period in December.</seg>
<seg id="304">If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT pre-registration.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no “supplementary” VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">If the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year is once submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT pre-registration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Taxpayers must file the VAT pre-registration electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual VAT return can be submitted either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If the submission is made without certification, the taxpayer must additionally submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">If no VAT pre-registrations or declarations are submitted, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover generated by the taxpayer6.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of late delivery, the taxpayer may be subject to a late payment surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of € 25,000).</seg>
<seg id="315">In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not charge this late fee.</seg>
<seg id="316">In the cases where the FÄ levied the late surcharges, the fixing of the amount was inconsistent and arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="317">The delay surcharge therefore fails to achieve its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular when filing the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or purchases.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable sales must be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="321">The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or recorded electronically by specially designated personnel.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="323">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="324">After all data are collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.</seg>
<seg id="325">The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible officer on the basis of the automatically generated audit notes (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the turnover of the taxpayer, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, taxpayers must file their pre-registrations no later than 10 days after the end of either the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annual VAT declaration must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to file an annual VAT return has several advantages and disadvantages:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registration by submitting a single VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">– If the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;</seg>
<seg id="335">– The federal states do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community purchases by German taxpayers until the annual VAT returns have usually been processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This levy obligation enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the responsible FA can compare the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the submitted income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are obliged to submit their VAT pre-registration electronically.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to file a tax return electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Filing and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">In accordance with the provisions of § 102 of Law No. 235/2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit corresponding summary notifications (hereinafter “ZM”).</seg>
<seg id="345">The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the VAT ID no.7 of the individual taxable persons under which they are registered in the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="346">Information on services is not provided in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="347">Taxpayers with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must hand over the ZM to the local FA on the 25th day after the end of each quarter at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days after the error has been detected.</seg>
<seg id="349">Incorrect data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similar to tax returns, taxpayers can also submit the ZM electronically.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a taxable person does not surrender a ZM or amending ZM, although he is obliged to do so under Act No. 235/2004, the tax official must request him to surrender the relevant ZM, pointing out the consequences of the non-levy. In the event of non-fulfilment of non-monetary obligations, the tax official is entitled to repeatedly impose fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Act No. 337/1992.</seg>
<seg id="352">In its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄ mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, when handing over the ZM, taxpayers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to hand over a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">According to § 102 (5) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax official is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Rectification ZM, to eliminate all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In case of disagreement</seg>
<seg id="356">8 of the information in the ZM with which The taxpayer corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax officer must correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">– the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,</seg>
<seg id="359">– the tax official has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or Rectification ZM.</seg>
<seg id="360">Corrections entered by the tax official, without a correction ZM being submitted by the taxpayer, do not replace the taxpayer's obligation to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from the CMs will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT may transmit and receive this data.</seg>
<seg id="363">This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The CLO automatically receives the notification “O_MCTL” from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect VAT ID numbers that were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the incorrect VAT number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the incorrect VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="366">The list contains a "Notice of doubt regarding VAT ID number".</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must indicate this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the designated lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases stated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods specified by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="370">The clerks there have to examine the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="371">Three different situations can then occur:</seg>
<seg id="372">A) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant sections of his VAT return is lower than the value of deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax official checks the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="374">B) The difference is zero.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer in the meantime submits a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.</seg>
<seg id="377">(c) The value of goods purchased from other Member States indicated by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return is higher than the value of their deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here again, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="379">After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the tax official enters the results of his review into ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">These results will be forwarded to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of transactions sent by the CLO for audit is shown in Graph No. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance) for the individual quarters of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="382">Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is partly due to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic purchaser.</seg>
<seg id="385">There may also be an error by the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of supplies are indicated differently in the CMs in the different EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons identified in the audited cases for deviations in the value of reported transactions are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly ZMs in which the intra-Community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="390">If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of VAT pre-registrations, this also applies to the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="391">The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">Electronic submission has been mandatory since 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="393">The competent FA can allow exemptions for individual taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">If the taxpayer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a correction ZM within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In case of non-delivery of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="396">This includes the following steps: – first reminder – second reminder, combined with the threat that a penalty will be imposed and – fixing the penalty.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German tax code allows the fixing of a penalty payment of up to 25,000 € (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of 125, 250 and 500 € in three stages.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxpayer acts improperly if he intentionally or recklessly does not deliver a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time or if he does not correct a ZM or not in time.</seg>
<seg id="399">This violation is punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ into the MIAS, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="401">The data of the ZM are only stored at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="402">The data from the summary reports are only available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in MIAS).</seg>
<seg id="405">In the case of incorrect VAT number in the ZM of German taxpayers, the German CLO receives a notification "O_MCTL" from the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be handed over to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then their task to request the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="409">In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT number at the request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the reminder and the threat and fixing of up to three consecutive penalties takes too much time when a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">The cases that were ultimately reported to the competent authorities were usually closed within one to two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The competent FA refused tax exemption for notified intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.</seg>
<seg id="413">If the taxpayer submitted the correct VAT number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="415">Therefore, the taxpayers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, the information on goods deliveries made in the VAT declarations or the VAT return is not compared with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This comparison can only be carried out by the FÄ. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT numbers are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data is used for the control of employment taxation in the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="420">As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data of previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications are drawn up and sent to the relevant departments.</seg>
<seg id="422">This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all VAT taxable persons is compiled later and forwarded to the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="423">The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares this data with those relating to intra-Community purchases.</seg>
<seg id="424">The system fully verifies (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must submit a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="427">The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of intra-Community supplies reported by the taxable persons in the CMs are compared with the values of intra-Community supplies indicated by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are taken into account as part of the tax determination.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.</seg>
<seg id="431">Since 1 January 2007, taxpayers have been required to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="432">The FÄ only have access to the data from the ZM after it has been processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">In both the Czech Republic and Germany, taxable persons only indicate the delivery of goods in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="434">The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the submitted ZM themselves.</seg>
<seg id="435">Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the taxpayer communicated the correct VAT ID number to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German taxable persons in their VAT declarations with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="439">The data provided by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech taxpayers will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods provided by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The Czech CLO carries out the comparison separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FÄ for examination.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such general control is only carried out in the case of taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons if the RMS has drawn up an audit report or if the taxable person has been selected for an audit anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the FÄ from clarifying the reasons for differences arising.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to hand over monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly levy would only marginally increase the bureaucratic burden, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or pre-registration anyway, and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or pre-registration.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the submission of VAT returns or pre-registration.</seg>
<seg id="452">An obligation to provide monthly CMs would, however, cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community supplies and those on intra-Community purchases, and would increase data flows between CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="454">The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In order for the obligation for the monthly levy of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O_MCTL reports exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarters.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data can be found in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">They have significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL message was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information at level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxpayers who have carried them out.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter “Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003”), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request takes place by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standardised SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their responses to a received RFI through the Financial Directorate to the CLO, which ensures that the information provided in the standardised SCAC form is translated into the foreign language and forwarded to the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It ensures their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent authorities for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by NKÚ.</seg>
<seg id="474">Out of the total of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests submitted by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">The total of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic resulted in a reply within the three-month period in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%); a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after expiry of this period and, in 19 cases, no reply had been received from Germany at the time of the examination by the NKÚ (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to determine when Germany responded to the request for information on the basis of the declared information).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Graph No. 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of intra-Community turnover stated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Graph No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The graph above shows that the sales examined in connection with requests for information usually had values of more than €60,000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="481">The tax officials of other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.</seg>
<seg id="484">“automatic exchange” in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="485">“structured automatic exchange” means the systematic transfer of previously defined information to another Member State, without its prior request, as soon as the relevant information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="487">The tax officer obtains this information from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing this form, the tax officer enters the required data into the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Afterwards, this data is transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, namely no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Czech Republic also transmits information to the other Member States on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential “missing traders”.</seg>
<seg id="490">This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the locally responsible FA.</seg>
<seg id="493">The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is monolingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community deliveries from Germany to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover that is below the minimum amount limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are neither in German nor in English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To answer the request for information, the CLO forwards it to the responsible FA and refers to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ of the answer to the unfinished requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The FÄ receive the required information by letter from the taxable person or by carrying out an external audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: the VAT special audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and flexible form of audit does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and has proven itself in the investigation of an individual turnover.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany will provide the other Member State with the following information: – on the VAT number allocated to companies established in other EC Member States – on the refund of input tax to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC Member States as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:</seg>
<seg id="507">A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without a VAT number, b. distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States that are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant differences between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, d. intra-Community deliveries of goods that have been incorrectly subject to taxation by the taxpayer in Germany, e. potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, and f. taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have misused a VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the locally responsible FÄ, who send the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates given information into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration dealt with 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were dealt with by the German financial administration only in 40.6% of cases within this period.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month deadline, it does not monitor its compliance.</seg>
<seg id="514">Due to the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of time-limited requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="515">The BRH has therefore recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has now changed.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices to reply to the outstanding requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at various levels of financial administration are involved in risk management in the area of value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of Value Added Tax and its Risk Management Unit deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.</seg>
<seg id="523">At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares the concept of risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates in this field with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The department for international administrative assistance in the field of VAT ensures, among other things, the exchange of information, participates in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the MIAS system, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.</seg>

<seg id="528">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="529">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="530">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="531">Among other things, the Department of Methodology of Tax Audit and Tax Investigation carries out risk analyses as part of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Their tasks include searching for taxable persons and industries that are risky with regard to the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, the pharmaceutical industry), searching for non-registered taxable persons (e.g. in the sectors of Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), investigating entanglements in cases of chain fraud and informing the local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected subjects.</seg>
<seg id="534">These have regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, also carry out tax audits outside the FÄ's local area of competence.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in identified new and “improved” forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain transactions.</seg>
<seg id="536">These special units audit according to the needs of the tax investigation agencies or focus on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and taxable persons with a particularly high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for reducing VAT risks have been integrated into the ATIS system: – the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the riskiness of tax returns filed; – the task of "selection of taxable persons to be audited", whereby the taxable persons to be audited are selected on the basis of certain criteria; – the task of "MIAS", which gives tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The “MIAS” task allows, inter alia, the following: – Verification of the validity of the VAT number of taxable persons from other Member States; – Confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person as indicated in the ZMs by all suppliers of the taxable person concerned from other Member States; – Preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not submitted ZMs; – Formal control of the information provided by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their ZMs before this information is transmitted to other Member States; – Preparation of a list of taxable persons in whose VAT returns the information on deliveries of goods to other Member States do not correspond with the information in the ZMs; – Preparation of a list of taxable persons in whose VAT returns the information on the value of the goods purchased from other Member States do not correspond with the information in the ZMs of all their suppliers from other Member States13.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their duties to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, trade registers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to their federal structure in the Federal Republic of Germany, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a completely uniform database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the CLO, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter “Kiss” – Coordination Office for Special Sales Tax Audits and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on cases of fraud in the OPUS database.</seg>
<seg id="545">In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters and also query them.</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates related cases of VAT fraud at national level as well as cases of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experiences of the KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">Experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.</seg>
<seg id="549">The formal review of the composition of the VAT number of other Member States appearing in the CMs of German taxpayers is carried out at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The examination of the validity of the VAT number mentioned in the ZM is carried out on the basis of the O_MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT numbers, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications for the discovery of suspected missing traders. As clues, certain characteristics are used, which usually occur in carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="553">The departments of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and must forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.</seg>
<seg id="554">The BRH audit confirmed that all available characteristics must be taken into account in order to be sufficiently likely to conclude a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).</seg>
<seg id="555">Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of various clues when preparing the communications.</seg>
<seg id="556">The risk management system should also take into account other indications, e.g. the payment behaviour of the taxpayer, the economic sector or the shareholding structure of the company.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the system draws up a list of taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community supplies in their VAT pre-registration or annual declaration.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete delivery of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as this would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="562">– Supplier and purchaser assume different dates for the execution of the intra-Community turnover;</seg>
<seg id="563">– different accounting recording and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing the information from the sales tax returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the sales tax returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owner/partner, number of employees and method of payment of the taxpayer).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules that allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as “risk managers”) to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax cheats are filtered out.</seg>
<seg id="566">This system is used in the processing of VAT pre-registration by the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="567">As a result, the responsible FA receives the information from the RMS before the VAT is set.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list, the competent tax authorities decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.</seg>
<seg id="574">In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called data-mining system) calculates how likely a taxpayer is to be involved in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax cheats.</seg>
<seg id="577">On the basis of this list, the FÄ select the relevant taxable persons for examination and report the examination results to the relevant data centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="580">Whether the hoped-for effects will occur during actual use remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have established that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Just like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">An exchange of experience is currently taking place between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud – in particular carousel fraud – has proved to be not a national but a European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.</seg>
<seg id="587">One Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="589">The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is based.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected results from the audit of individual sales As part of the parallel audits, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="593">Which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two courts of auditors jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, about the implementation of which there were doubts, or which the taxpayers of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, in 43 cases, based on notifications from the BRH, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany that Czech taxpayers had indicated in their tax returns and ZM.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="598">The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech taxpayer declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech tax authorities sent a request for information to Germany in order to check the value of the delivered goods.</seg>
<seg id="603">In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="604">Furthermore, it emerged from the answer that the VAT number of the German taxpayer was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application by the German taxpayer and brought forward the validity of the VAT number retroactively to 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this information, it was an (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="607">Through a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech taxpayer had submitted supplementary VAT returns for the individual (sub-annual) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of the purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from the purchases from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the responsible officer of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was also included in the declared purchases.</seg>
<seg id="609">In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH stated that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number at the time of registration, but only for a tax number that was ultimately valid for Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively allocate a VAT number to a taxable person, the responsible clerk of the German tax administration did so in 2006 with retroactive effect from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO assigns a VAT number retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer's application for a VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO issues the VAT number retroactively because, according to § 6 UStG, the entrepreneur does not need a valid VAT number for an intra-Community delivery.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, a German buyer does not need the (valid) VAT number of his supplier to declare the intra-Community purchase.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the VAT number retroactively in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested a review of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.</seg>
<seg id="618">From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the locally competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">In their reply, the German authorities stated that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons had only been allocated a VAT number in Germany on 16 February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">Through a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit on the Czech taxpayer for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared services worth CZK 9,897 in his VAT return which he had rendered to the German taxpayer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">The (Czech) tax office fixed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 to the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="623">In response to the request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the VAT number had only been allocated to the German taxpayer when he registered his company founded in 2004 with the FA on 16 February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this VAT return, the taxable person reported intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic to the value of € 160 (approx. CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In his VAT return for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="627">When checking the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the delivery of goods to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech taxpayer filed a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries to the value of CZK 114,615 and value added tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">Through a request to the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person subsequently filed an application for the resumption of tax proceedings in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxable person had been registered since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">The German information revealed that the German taxpayer had only been assigned a VAT number on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to reopen the tax proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH stated that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place because the German taxpayer had only received a VAT number on 11 November 2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the value added tax on it and also demanded the reimbursement of input taxes in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the German taxpayer's tax liability, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German taxpayer named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the response in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax official.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxable person from a German taxable person to the value of €22,686.</seg>
<seg id="640">Through a request to the local competent tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ established that the Czech tax official had examined, as part of an external audit with the Czech taxpayer, whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT number in the invoice, but only his tax number intended for transactions within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the German taxpayer's registration certificate so that he could, if necessary, initiate appropriate tax proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech FA regarded this business as the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set a value added tax for the purchase of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH stated that under German law, a taxable person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only have the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">In this case, the turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community delivery, which should be subject to purchase taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this transaction, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum limit of € 15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">Within the framework of intergovernmental administrative assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery of goods by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech taxpayer stated that he had not received the goods, had never had a business relationship with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documentation for subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax determination stood.</seg>
<seg id="656">In response to a request from the NKÚ, the BRH determined that the German taxpayer acted as “fiscal representative17” (§ 22 (a) – (e) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to tax exemption was recognised.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">In Section 4.6.1 it was shown that the answers of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than the answers of the Czech financial administration:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. During its examination, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of goods delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person to the value of €86,307; however, the Czech taxable person only declared the purchase of goods to the value of €35,314 in his VAT return for the same period.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, a Czech tax official, using a SCAC form, requested a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The NKÚ noted that at the time of its examination a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received.</seg>
<seg id="667">Through a request to the local tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person had not declared the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German taxable person to the value of CZK 11,816,103 in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer submitted a corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="669">Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany. It was established that the purchase of all the motor vehicles in question had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were resold to other taxable persons in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="672">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="673">By contacting the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">Even at the request of the tax official, the Czech taxpayer did not file any tax returns. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction for the examination of the aforementioned delivery from the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the reply to the request for information was not received until 7 February 2007, until the conclusion of the NKÚ audit, it was not known how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="678">Due to non-compliance with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax official, using an SCAC form, requested a review of a €16,991 delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer for deliveries to the value of €16,335.</seg>
<seg id="683">On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA on the purchaser in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German purchaser declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, a Czech tax official, using an SCAC form, requested a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, showing signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits on the Czech taxpayer in order to verify the deduction of above-average input taxes.</seg>
<seg id="688">However, an unjustified claim has not been established.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114 in his VAT returns for the relevant period, and that the examination of the German FA with the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community purchases in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.</seg>
<seg id="691">In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistencies18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to data from MIAS, the Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official and there was no business activity at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax official requested a review of how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="695">The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German tax authorities, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder.</seg>
<seg id="696">The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth €21,659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer an incorrect payment confirmation for the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After uncovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the delivered material, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.</seg>
<seg id="699">Through a request to the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received from the Czech taxpayer, the financial administration subsequently taxed the turnover of goods deliveries from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.</seg>
<seg id="700">In response to a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that, after corrections, the German supplier had reported only one delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth €7,916.</seg>
<seg id="701">In accordance with German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="702">His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech taxpayer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxpayer with goods with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The NKÚ found that the Czech tax authorities had carried out an audit on the Czech taxpayer in order to investigate this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the request for information, the Czech tax authorities announced that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and assembled a production plant for the German.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German taxpayer did not remove the assembled production plant and claimed defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German taxpayer received the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">By contacting the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices had been properly recorded in the Czech taxpayer's books.</seg>
<seg id="713">The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH noted that, based on the response of the Czech financial administration, the locally competent FA came to the conclusion that these sales were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxpayer to the German, including the performed assembly.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German recipient of the work delivery owes the value added tax in accordance with the German Value Added Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient can claim an input tax deduction of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">Since the VAT liability of the German taxpayer remained unchanged, the German FA did not initiate a correction of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to MIAS data, Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from German taxpayer C in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany to verify this information.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German taxpayer C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that he had returned it to the German taxpayer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the German tax authorities, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch office of the German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">The latter received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's branch in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since this delivery (from C to A) only took place within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">By contacting the local tax official responsible for taxable person B, the NKÚ established that, according to the MIAS data, German taxable person C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">Taxable person B stated that he had not received these goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">The answer was that the machine had been delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">In the course of further investigations with the taxpayer B, the tax official found that the machine worth €88,027 had not been registered with the taxpayer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German taxpayer C had delivered to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The NKÚ also found that the Czech tax official locally responsible for taxable person A had carried out an audit on him.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax official had the invoice of the German taxable person C dated 7 February 2005, in which the taxable person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax official found that taxable person A had not recorded this invoice.</seg>
<seg id="733">Taxable person A had entered into a leasing agreement with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also took care of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of taxable person A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH stated that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine worth €88,027 not to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxpayer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the claim of the German taxpayer C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German taxpayer D delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">Under German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">The BRH also noted that the German taxpayer C had indicated in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth € 58,000 to the Czech taxpayer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="743">The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries by a German taxpayer worth € 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="746">The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The German taxpayer has not carried out any active business activities since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit on the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="749">The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim of the German taxpayer against the German financial administration, which the Czech taxpayer had asserted as a shareholder in the German company with the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official so far has no information that the German tax administration is handling the case in relation to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is clear from the available information that this was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to state the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see also Section 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to MIAS data, a German taxable person delivered goods with a total value of €33,205 to a Czech taxable person in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="754">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxable person and that he had collected the remaining goods in person.</seg>
<seg id="757">By contacting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ established that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the relevant period before receiving a reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="758">Nevertheless, the differences regarding the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="759">This test has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to the MIAS data, a German taxable person had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.</seg>
<seg id="762">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="763">With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of € 31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="764">By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that, after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and stayed with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about filing a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">Until now, no supplementary VAT return has been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way as to meet the deadlines for a retroactive VAT determination for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official requested to check whether the aforementioned Czech taxpayer actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer had founded a number of bogus companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">In the course of the review of the transaction by the FA, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech taxpayer presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech taxpayer was not registered as liable for VAT in Germany and had not paid tax on the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="775">In a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that, following a tax audit, the Czech taxpayer had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German taxpayer and, at the same time, asserted the right of deduction for purchases from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare any VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="777">On the basis of a supplementary VAT return submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to Czech legislation, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case, as the goods were not shipped or transported to the Czech Republic from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="779">Thus, the Czech tax official drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded the payment of VAT to the value of €1,600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent FA sent a control notification to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community deliveries which may not have been carried out:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax authorities on the question of whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">A copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer was attached to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="786">As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="787">In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not brought a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had had no contact with a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="789">With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.</seg>
<seg id="790">By contacting the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ established that the Czech taxpayer does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is not available.</seg>
<seg id="791">Following a tax complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax official set the Czech taxpayer's tax liability at zero.</seg>
<seg id="792">In the course of a further investigation, the Czech tax official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an Internet advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="793">The BRH found that the locally responsible German tax official had rejected the claim of the German taxpayer to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of € 3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="795">A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested verification of the deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech taxpayer filed a VAT return and a ZM which, after the deletion of the managing director, had been signed in the commercial register by a person not authorised to do so, namely this shareholder of the company.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax official that the capital owner had paid the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash receipts were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">In a request to the locally competent Czech FA, the NKÚ stated that the tax official had recognised the Czech taxpayer's right to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German buyer, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the earlier external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic to the value of €4,251,196 in 2005, after having purchased goods to the value of €43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community purchases in his VAT return for 2004 or in the one for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, he did not declare corresponding initial sales in terms of value.</seg>
<seg id="808">Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).</seg>
<seg id="812">From the documents provided to NKÚ by the competent tax officer, it is clear that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the taxpayer was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the commercial register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without a new managing director being appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">The Czech taxpayer has not filed any VAT returns since April 2006.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the parallel investigation, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany that were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two courts of auditors exchanged information on the cases examined via the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct taxable business in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Based on this information, the company was registered in June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria in the name, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to insufficient own production capacities, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German taxpayer (UDE) based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of the wind turbines:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:</seg>
<seg id="824">– The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its own risk and for its own account.</seg>
<seg id="825">Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), as the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the home country of the Czech company19.</seg>
<seg id="828">Accordingly, this delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the input tax deduction in its VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.</seg>
<seg id="830">However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">– Delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">– The delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">Ensuring the taxation of intra-Community purchases in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case designs in order to show the size of the differences caused by the different legislation of 2004 between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="839">The cases examined also show that it will take some time for taxpayers and tax authorities to apply the new legal provisions:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In his ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech taxable person reported intra-Community deliveries in his ZM to another German taxable person with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.</seg>
<seg id="842">The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that electricity was supplied in both cases.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that different legal provisions on the supply or purchase of electrical energy were in force between the Czech Republic and Germany in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="845">Whereas in the Czech Republic, taxable persons declared supplies of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, this was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The differences in legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. When examining intra-Community deliveries or purchases in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxable person declared intra-Community deliveries in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to a German taxable person to the total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech taxable person declared intra-Community deliveries in his ZM for the same period to another German taxable person to the value of CZK 263,470,776.</seg>
<seg id="848">Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that both cases involved supplies of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">In accordance with the wording of Act No. 235/2004 applicable from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, his place of business or his place of business for which this delivery takes place.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have indicated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electrical energy in their CMs as intra-Community supplies resulted in a difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="852">Closing remarks</seg>
<seg id="853">Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NKÚ were achieved.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both courts of auditors gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal provisions governing VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-community deliveries or purchases came to light.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them are worth further observation.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit results, both courts of auditors drew up recommendations for the administration of value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of further monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation between the two courts of auditors form the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of VAT administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement of construction services and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and Overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The award of services by public contracting authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state has the task of using public funds as economically and sparingly as possible, as well as ensuring fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important element in the creation of a single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, EU member states must transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The provision of services is also an area at risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="12">Due to the generally high potential for damage, contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favours when awarding their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits both for the EU-wide award of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="14">The audits focused on the application of the EU public procurement law implemented in national regulations as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in building construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">Awards below the EU thresholds were also taken into consideration with a view to preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit results of both Courts of Auditors are summarised in this Joint Report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="18">Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests, which it carried out in the years 2011/2012 at the construction administrations, which are responsible for the road and building construction of the federal government in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">In doing so, he examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the Federal Audit Office used results from earlier investigations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on examination findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The examinations included construction measures in road construction, railway track construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is mainly carried out by the building administrations of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In building construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budget funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, freelancers are also involved for parts of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="26">When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="27">Development of public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to the national field are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions based on it.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, many supplementary individual rules are laid down by internal administrative provisions for both EU-wide and national contracts.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in compliance with public procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other statutory provisions that apply both above and below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">The public procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules increased transparency in the handling of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited the scope for corruption in procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="35">Basic principles of public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, EU-wide awards are subject in particular to the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, for measures below the EU threshold, the national award types (public tender, restricted tender, hands-free award) must be applied, but these largely correspond to the EU-wide award types mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public invitation to tender (for national contracts).</seg>
<seg id="39">Any interested company can submit an offer in the open procedure and in the public invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">Above all, the division of an overall construction project into specialist and partial lots serves this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="42">The individual allocation of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures also apply to construction projects below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded when competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Construction volume of public contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to 307 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of this, 45.5 billion euros went to public construction (15%), which includes, in addition to federal construction, in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The construction volume of the federal government in building construction and highway construction (excluding railway track construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="54">The volume of contracts for construction work in federal building construction and highway construction was distributed among the contract types in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiation procedures and hands-free contracts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 4.7 billion in 2011, representing approximately 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, which corresponded to 37% of the total construction volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the threshold 2.7% other procedures</seg>
<seg id="59">The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded by public procurement authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits carried out by both countries are aimed at a significant proportion of public contracts, that the prevention of corruption, which must be observed in all contracts, is of great financial importance, and that the open procedure and the public tender play an outstanding role in the awarding of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the results of the parallel tests</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits on the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption in their respective countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">In this context, the working groups of both courts of auditors compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">In doing so, they essentially stated:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU directives on the award of works by public contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (points 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the EU requirements, corruption prevention is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which partly differ in their priorities and their details (No. 3.2).</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, an essential requirement for procurement documents is that they must contain all the information required for the proper preparation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The performance specifications must be neutral and must not have any competition-limiting requirements.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Germany, the award documents have largely met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject of the contract sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, construction work should preferably be divided into lots in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">In its audits, particularly in the field of road construction, the NKÚ found that the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Narrowing of the market potential can result in significant cost increases and entail the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">According to the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, in principle agree with the already contracted companies additional or modified services that prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective requirements for determining the type of award were predominantly followed in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide awards or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national awards, applies.</seg>
<seg id="79">This allows more companies to submit offers.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, cost databases are used to determine the costs of public buildings, in particular in building construction,</seg>
<seg id="84">The completed construction projects are based on the evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">In the case of construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to prepare for the planned awards at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="87">The audited building authorities generally complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (point 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities in both countries should change as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.</seg>
<seg id="93">In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of applicants were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, during the offer phase, in the interests of equal competition, it must be ensured that the companies interested in submitting a bid receive the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">Contact between these companies with each other and with freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description must be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, some of the audited building authorities in Germany did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">When opening up offers in both countries, particular attention must be paid to the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="101">The specifications for the labelling, documentation, storage and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are laid down in particular detail in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tests in both countries resulted in only a few complaints (No. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Examination and evaluation of the offers are determined in both countries by specifications for the structure and process organization.</seg>
<seg id="104">The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited awarding bodies.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, awarding bodies handed over offers for examination to third parties without first reviewing the offers and sufficiently documenting abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="106">The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (No. 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition are to be informed of the intended contract before the contract is awarded.</seg>
<seg id="108">This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="109">The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to meet the specified deadlines or deviate from the content of the bidder's offer (No. 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible by the audited building administrations in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.</seg>
<seg id="113">Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the corruption-preventive function of the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">EU public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure unrestricted competition with the free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the 8 member states.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination and the principle of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive contains special rules for construction projects to be awarded throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="120">For this purpose, their estimated order amounts must currently reach or exceed 5,000,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="121">The regulations concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, e.g. for the receipt of bids, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of candidates and The Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of candidates and bidders.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, the companies concerned can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">Importance of Preventing Corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,</seg>
<seg id="128">Which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and cause considerable damage to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the global costs of corruption amount to 5% of world economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of contracting authorities, anti-competitive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">They have to check the structural and operational organisation of their administrations for areas that are particularly at risk of corruption in order to put in place appropriate safeguards against corruption.</seg>
<seg id="135">Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption – in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits – is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="139">In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on corruption prevention in the Federal Administration. Thereafter, in addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed in the area of procurement: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, Basic separation of planning, awarding and billing, Accurate and complete documentation of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the public procurement regulations.</seg>
<seg id="141">For example, the Federal Ministry responsible for procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="142">With the award data – such as the estimated costs and the order amounts – as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected nationwide and evaluated for abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="144">The statutory requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, form the most important basis for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on the fight against corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of the measures recommended therein have already been incorporated into national public procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions UM14.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation essentially contains the following provisions: the lowering of the thresholds for smaller contracts, the obligation to give prior notice of the awards by the awarding body, including the indication of the reasons for the invitation to tender, the prohibition of the restriction of the number of bidders in undisclosed procedures and thus the abolition of the possibility of selecting bidders by lottery, the introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, the introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Examination results for the individual phases of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Award documents The award documents must contain all the information that the bidders need to prepare an appropriate tender.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the award documents must enable an accurate calculation.</seg>
<seg id="152">No risks may be transferred to the bidders that are not calculable for them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The award documents consist in particular of the service description and the terms and conditions of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="154">In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.</seg>
<seg id="155">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="156">The requirements of EU law for procurement documents relate in particular to the technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="157">These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="158">In principle, the service description must be product-neutral.</seg>
<seg id="159">Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.</seg>
<seg id="160">The avoidance of competition-limiting requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the creation of the offers as well as for manipulation in their evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="162">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="163">Same or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications have been transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="164">In principle, the services are to be advertised product-neutral without factory specifications.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the service descriptions, the individual services must generally be subdivided in detail into performance units with respective quantity specifications.</seg>
<seg id="166">The prices are to be agreed on the basis of service units (e.g. Euro per m2 or per piece).</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases may performance be defined by functional targets.</seg>
<seg id="168">In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain exact quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are required.</seg>
<seg id="170">Payments after lump sums or after expenditure of time are to be avoided as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified specifications in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender shall not be announced until the award documents have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Divergent rules</seg>
<seg id="175">There is no obligation to tender construction works in lots in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="176">If it is possible according to the type of work to be carried out, the public contracting authorities can divide construction work into several lots.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, construction services are generally divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and/or by type or subject area (specialist lots).</seg>
<seg id="178">The aim is to enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price fixing more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be specified in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should enable applicants to fully and conclusively identify the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in the EU-wide award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="183">In the case of national award procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be recorded in an internal administrative award note.</seg>
<seg id="184">Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or experts in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contact with these freelancers without the client's knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why freelancers may neither send award documents nor interpret planning documents for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="187">The only contact person for the companies is the customer.</seg>
<seg id="188">There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additional or modified services that prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) are almost always required for large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="190">In both countries, the legal provisions make it possible, to a certain extent, to award additional contracts to the company that has already been commissioned, without the need for a public procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">According to the EU requirements and the German provisions, the remuneration of the supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to such an award without public notice.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the ongoing construction work.</seg>
<seg id="195">If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible according to the regulations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="196">Rather, the determination of the remuneration for the additional services must be based on the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.</seg>
<seg id="199">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">Some performance specifications also contained product-related specifications – for example for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels – without this being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product came into question.</seg>
<seg id="205">Lists of services subdivided according to partial services</seg>
<seg id="206">In none of the examined proceedings has the BRH found any violations of the offer to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="208">In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="209">In some procedures, the award documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.</seg>
<seg id="210">In some cases, the performance lists contained positions for which it was not clear whether they were needed.</seg>
<seg id="211">A list of services for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such demand positions.</seg>
<seg id="212">Lots and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">Many awards lacked the prescribed reasons why the services, which were mainly advertised to non-qualified persons, were not further divided into partial lots.</seg>
<seg id="214">There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="215">References to freelancers</seg>
<seg id="216">A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.</seg>
<seg id="217">Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or reports.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the awarding authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect “on questions relating to the invitation to tender”.</seg>
<seg id="219">In particular in the building construction sector, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints pointed out mainly to omissions of the freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="220">The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance specifications.</seg>
<seg id="221">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.</seg>
<seg id="223">The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without giving reasons.</seg>
<seg id="224">Suppliers and products were also specified in the tender for the construction of several university buildings.</seg>
<seg id="225">Performance descriptions with performance units</seg>
<seg id="226">For construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="227">As performance units, it specified only the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="229">During the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance specifications were changed four times as part of a non-open procedure between August and September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">Since the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.</seg>
<seg id="231">Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary structural engineering studies and incomplete construction drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="232">During the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not contain any requirements for product quality.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result of this lack of specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lots and eligibility criteria</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="236">An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that with a loose allocation of selected parts, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible at a total cost of 620.3 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="237">In the case of six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, EUR 2.5 million (25 %) could have been saved in the case of a loose award.</seg>
<seg id="238">With a loose allocation of the construction of 20 bridges, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.</seg>
<seg id="239">When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.</seg>
<seg id="240">During the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required the bidders in an open procedure to prove, among other things, that at least three road construction projects had been carried out, each worth EUR 28 million over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public procurement of another section of a motorway comprised six separate construction projects for which the contracting authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million over the last three years as a suitability criterion for the companies.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were allocated to contracts from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.</seg>
<seg id="244">In 46 procurement procedures with a contract volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even only one bidder submitted a bid.</seg>
<seg id="245">The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Additional services</seg>
<seg id="247">During the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures for the award of additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.</seg>
<seg id="248">Due to unclear volume and quality specifications, supplements were incurred in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case up to EUR 165.4 million (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="249">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="250">For several university buildings, some achievements were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="251">Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value set by national public procurement law, the contracting authority carried out negotiation procedures with the contracted companies without notice.</seg>
<seg id="252">During the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiation proceedings without a call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction period, the contracting authority expanded the scope of the work by 2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">Based on a random sampling of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometer in the Czech Republic is up to EUR 14.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">In Germany, however, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Building Ministry, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometer is up to 10.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison indicates that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="260">The basic rules on procurement documents are largely the same in both countries and take EU requirements into account.</seg>
<seg id="261">They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">For example, the requirement for sufficient determination of the service descriptions should enable bidders to properly calculate and prepare their offers,</seg>
<seg id="263">Protect the client from additional services to be subsequently agreed and also limit the scope for speculation.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations that are intended to further reduce restrictions on competition and opportunities for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="265">In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="266">The requirements for performance specifications have been largely met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The existing requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.</seg>
<seg id="269">In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can result in restrictions of the provider field to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="270">The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="271">Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">With regard to the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ from one another.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to the EU requirements and the German provisions, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded without a public tendering procedure under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, up to which additional services can be awarded in the negotiation process without notice to the original contractor.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="277">As the scope of public contracts is often insufficiently determined.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of award, the client determines the scope of the number of companies participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">It can leave the circle of possible applicants and bidders largely unlimited, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by specifying non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="283">For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must in particular take into account the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services are generally to be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="288">The contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement for construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold and award construction services in national contracts, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="289">A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to remove it from the obligation to award construction services on a Europe-wide basis.</seg>
<seg id="290">Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="291">The detailed justification of the selected type of award as well as the examination of the obligation to apply the EU procurement rules are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.</seg>
<seg id="295">Divergent rules</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EUR Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="297">There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible under certain conditions defined by law.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or – in the case of national contracts – the public invitation to tender have priority. This is laid down by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the guidelines for the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of award – such as the non-open procedure or the limited invitation to tender – are only possible in exceptional cases, which are conclusively regulated by public procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender is to ensure as unrestricted a competition as possible, to exclude possibilities of manipulation by fixing on certain bidders and to complicate possible price agreements among the bidders.</seg>
<seg id="302">The principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.</seg>
<seg id="304">The construction services in Germany can use the planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public building construction.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost parameters for building categories, units of use, components or individual construction services.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such cost parameters, the estimated contract value of a planned project or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few construction administrations in Germany have corresponding cost databases for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price calculations of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated costs of construction work.</seg>
<seg id="310">In most cases, the cost calculations are based on estimates by the financing body or result from the amount of funds made available to the construction site.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="312">As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011 - 2012, the responsible ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.</seg>
<seg id="313">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="314">Information on the cost of materials and on construction and extension works as well as other cost-relevant data are to be recorded in this database in order to enable the determination of costs and the determination of unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control.</seg>
<seg id="316">Which is intended to serve as a benchmark for pricing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="317">Key audit results BRH</seg>
<seg id="318">Selection of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities largely advertised the construction services in an open procedure or in a public call for tenders and thus followed the requirements of budgetary and public procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the federal government's construction work in building construction was advertised to the public or in an open process.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">When choosing non-public types of procurement, there was a partial lack of detailed reasons why the awarding bodies had to deviate from the principle of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="323">In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public procurement methods have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as for hands-free contracts.</seg>
<seg id="325">The investigation also showed that bid prices for restricted tenders and hands-off contracts were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel investigations by the Federal Building Ministry and a State Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public types of procurement.</seg>
<seg id="327">As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Building Ministry even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="329">The audited contracting authorities usually drew up procurement plans for the construction projects, for which they had determined an estimated total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, in which they determined the construction services to be awarded according to EU-wide and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, this always meant that more than 80% of the construction work had to be awarded across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to award contracts across the EU by means of cost estimates that were set too low.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, it actually fell below the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="333">During construction, some contracting authorities impermissibly changed the specifications of their procurement plans.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be complied with.</seg>
<seg id="335">For most of the construction measures examined, the proportion of EU-wide contracts awarded according to the accounting results was usually lower than provided for in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities breached the requirement to tender all individual lots totalling EUR 1,000,000 or more in EU-wide procedures;</seg>
<seg id="337">And chose national procedures instead.</seg>
<seg id="338">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of award type</seg>
<seg id="340">In several major construction measures, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects as part of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several partial contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.</seg>
<seg id="341">As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="342">Calculation methods for the estimated order value</seg>
<seg id="343">In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an insufficient instrument to be able to determine the expected order values.</seg>
<seg id="344">The data was based on just completed construction projects, in which, however, there were indications of a lack of cost-effectiveness, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the commissioned companies.</seg>
<seg id="345">For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% below the estimated order values determined with the help of the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="347">In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by the investors.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual order values differed greatly from the estimated values.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, but eight supplements in the course of the construction led to a cost increase of 2.1 million euros or 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, which also led to cost increases in the construction phase.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the offer prices exceeded the estimated values and increased during construction.</seg>
<seg id="352">In the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately by 139%, as the usable area had expanded by only 12%.</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented the EU regulations for determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations correspond to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in public procedures or public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="357">Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of bids and the most economic results.</seg>
<seg id="358">The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the field of applicants by provisions of the client that are susceptible to manipulation and by making price agreements between bidders more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="359">The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be restricted in proceedings involving a previous competition.</seg>
<seg id="362">This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the awarding bodies have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been impermissibly allocated in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.</seg>
<seg id="364">When taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be detected in Germany which resulted in a falling short of the minimum proportion of services advertised throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected costs of construction work and construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">The building authorities should, if necessary, carry out further checks to ensure that the requirements for the choice of the type of award and the scope of services to be put out to tender throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for appropriate cost assessments are established.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and announcement</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public client must inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">The preliminary information should contain the essential information under public procurement law on the planned construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">In announcements, the client must provide binding details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="374">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="375">In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.</seg>
<seg id="376">When describing the object of the order, the Europe-wide standardised vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes) must be used.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the purchaser's profile.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the text of the announcement has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or incorrect information in the announcement may affect competition and may even support manipulation.</seg>

<seg id="381">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for prior information and notification into national law.</seg>
<seg id="383">Divergent rules</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published in the case of construction work not to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="385">Award procedures may be started no earlier than one month after the preliminary information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the national Official Journal (for all awards).</seg>
<seg id="386">The publication of preliminary information can only be waived in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, no preliminary information is required for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="388">In national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions prior to restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Government's Internet portal and, if necessary, also in newspapers or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted tenders without a competition, announcements of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">All planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.</seg>
<seg id="391">In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the loose construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="392">This scheme has only a limited impact in the Czech Republic, where much less construction work is divided into lots.</seg>
<seg id="393">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Preliminary information</seg>
<seg id="396">The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open procedures, however, they shortened offer periods, although the necessary period of 52 days between the sending of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the 12-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many published preliminary information, there were no indications of the planned division of the construction work into lots.</seg>
<seg id="400">Announcements</seg>
<seg id="401">The announcements of the audited bodies partly contained CPV codes which differed from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately cover the required services.</seg>
<seg id="402">In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information – e.g. on implementation deadlines – than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service provider to publish the national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="405">The latter published the reports on its own fee-based award platform.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the reports to the federal government's free internet portal as required.</seg>
<seg id="407">Random samples showed that only one third of the reports from the audited administration were published on this portal.</seg>

<seg id="409">Announcements</seg>
<seg id="410">For the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify the criteria on the basis of which it wanted to select the bidders.</seg>
<seg id="411">The awarding authority was unable to prove how the bidders were selected.</seg>
<seg id="412">The restriction on the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.</seg>
<seg id="413">During the construction of a motorway ring, the awarding authority did not specify in more detail in a non-open procedure, either in the announcement or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it wanted to evaluate the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="414">In its evaluation, the awarding body came to the conclusion that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicant with the worst ratings from the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="415">The awarding body's procedure was not transparent because it had not provided information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.</seg>

<seg id="417">During the renovation of the former military site, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.</seg>
<seg id="418">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage information system with preliminary information and notification is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement in Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates for non-public award types</seg>
<seg id="422">In contrast to public procurement procedures, in non-public procurement procedures, not every company interested in carrying out the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="423">In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must select in advance which companies should be invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU regulations allow for a limit on the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies must be invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the case of negotiation procedures with notification of tenders, at least three companies must be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. by giving unilateral preference to certain companies.</seg>
<seg id="430">In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both cases, the award result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="432">The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="435">The rules for selecting applicants are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding bodies should change as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor should competition be limited to companies established in certain regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The awarding bodies must justify the selection of applicants and document the course of the selection process in their award notes.</seg>
<seg id="439">Divergent rules</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three suitable candidates must be invited to submit bids in the case of restricted tenders and several suitable candidates in the case of open tenders.</seg>
<seg id="441">Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two specific areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.</seg>
<seg id="443">For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or a contractor from the contracting authority must usually amend this proposal, for example by removing a proposed company and/or supplementing a new company.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is to prevent a single person from being able to conclusively determine the group of companies to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could lead to far-reaching agreements between the parties involved.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of companies to be requested is – also with regard to freelancers – to be treated confidentially and not to be made generally accessible.</seg>
<seg id="447">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for drawing up and keeping secret lists of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="449">According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be invited, but can only submit proposals to the awarding body.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.</seg>
<seg id="451">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of applicants</seg>
<seg id="454">The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts has been met, with a few exceptions.</seg>
<seg id="455">An evaluation by the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European procurement procedures for construction work in building construction showed that the contracting authorities requested an average of 6.6 companies to submit bids for restricted federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for free-hand contracts.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of companies and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">Especially for trades with few suppliers, the awarding bodies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.</seg>
<seg id="458">Above all, they took into account well-known and, from their point of view, proven companies.</seg>
<seg id="459">As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete even before the invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="460">The BRH did not find an impermissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting authorities attributed this primarily to the fact that the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is significantly lower on average and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Multi-eyes principle and suggestions Freelancer</seg>
<seg id="463">Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.</seg>
<seg id="464">They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.</seg>
<seg id="465">It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies that had been invited to submit bids.</seg>
<seg id="466">Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the lists of applicants and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the awarding bodies.</seg>
<seg id="467">Thus, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the required extent from possible manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidential treatment of bidder lists</seg>
<seg id="469">At a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.</seg>
<seg id="470">In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or authorised companies could have been passed on without authorisation and could, for example, have facilitated agreements between these companies.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases reasons for the selection of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="473">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection of candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive any information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="476">In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the announcements did not indicate how the selection of candidates should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="477">In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, which exceeded the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="478">The procurement committee then carried out a lottery procedure to select the companies.</seg>
<seg id="479">However, this approach, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="481">Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special measures to prevent undue restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements restrict such possibilities of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of the Czech regulations, in particular, the newly introduced requirement of a largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for an abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting authorities should fully address the shortcomings identified.</seg>
<seg id="486">Offer phase</seg>
<seg id="487">With the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, the tender phase begins, in which the companies can prepare tenders on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.</seg>
<seg id="488">Candidates may submit their bids until the end of the offer period set by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="490">There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authorities must comply with the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the tender phase.</seg>
<seg id="492">These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.</seg>
<seg id="493">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="495">The award documents on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their bids must, in principle, only be sent by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to perform this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The awarding authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the bidding phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of ambiguities in the award documents or other questions regarding the invitation to tender, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="499">Freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the award documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="501">Freelancers must not become a hub of the procurement process through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.</seg>
<seg id="502">Bids submitted by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Electronically transmitted offers must have a technical encryption.</seg>
<seg id="504">Divergent rules</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the registry can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obligated to the confidentiality of the offers and to the conscientious fulfillment of the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="506">The offers received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and forwarded directly, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This employee may not be involved in the award.</seg>
<seg id="508">The offers received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The registry records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt details in a log.</seg>

<seg id="514">The tests for the tender phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building administration.</seg>
<seg id="515">Dispatch of the award documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The awarding bodies of the audited building administration sent the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service provider.</seg>
<seg id="517">Freelancers did not send any award documents.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to applicants</seg>
<seg id="519">For the most part, the audited building management did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and procurement when naming the contact persons for queries and information.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting authority, but from the project management as contact persons.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some award documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had drawn up the performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="522">In the case of inquiries during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="523">Marking of offers</seg>
<seg id="524">At the audited building administration, all offers received were marked with an entry stamp and a notice of receipt.</seg>
<seg id="525">In some hands-free contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the provisions to prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Safekeeping of offers</seg>
<seg id="527">Once they had been labelled, not all offers were sent directly and immediately to the employee responsible for safekeeping, who enclosed the offers in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">In a construction site, the offers were in the meantime stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which every employee had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another office had hung up a mailbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers thrown in there even remained overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">Since the throw-in slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only employees, but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to extract and, if necessary, manipulate received offers.</seg>
<seg id="531">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="532">No defects were objected to on the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="534">During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="535">By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.</seg>
<seg id="536">The regulations on the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers appear to be suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening of offers</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents read out and thus made public.</seg>

<seg id="544">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">No separate EU legal regulations are laid down for the opening of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, the national regulations for the prevention of corruption contain extensive requirements for the protection of bids and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>

<seg id="548">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">The multi-eyes principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.</seg>
<seg id="552">In most procurement procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="553">Only offers submitted to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are admitted to the opening.</seg>
<seg id="554">Offers received late may in principle no longer be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices must be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="556">The minutes must be read out and signed by the management of the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="557">It can also be signed by the bidders present.</seg>

<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a committee carries out the opening of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="560">Freelancers can also participate.</seg>
<seg id="561">The committee can also be tasked with further phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.</seg>
<seg id="563">The negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.</seg>
<seg id="564">The negotiator and, when awarding contracts in building construction, also the secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the awarding and execution of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and discounts as well as special features – such as damaged or delayed offers – must be recorded in the minutes of the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="567">The German regulations provide that the opened offers are to be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.</seg>
<seg id="568">The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.</seg>
<seg id="569">Corresponding Czech regulations do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="570">If only one offer is received during an award procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unappreciated.</seg>

<seg id="574">Multi-eyes principle</seg>
<seg id="575">The audited awarding bodies implemented the requirements for the multi-eyes principle at the opening dates.</seg>
<seg id="576">They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries, who were not charged with any other award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the case of hands-free contracts with a smaller scope of services, however, there were isolated cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>

<seg id="579">In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.</seg>

<seg id="581">Marking of offers</seg>
<seg id="582">The awarding bodies examined as part of the cross-sectional examination marked the offers in accordance with the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="583">In previous audits of some grant recipients, insufficient labelling had been identified.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, these awarding bodies changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="585">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="586">Offer period</seg>
<seg id="587">When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was not received by the awarding authority until one month after the end of the offer period. Nevertheless, the awarding authority accepted this offer.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="589">The regulations of both countries on the opening of offers agree in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of offers can be significantly limited.</seg>
<seg id="590">The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the process as well as the labelling, secure storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly limit the possibilities of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, the persons entrusted with the opening of the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The total of only a few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of the offers</seg>
<seg id="595">Examination and evaluation of the offers The client must check and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="596">He has to determine the offer for the award of the surcharge that best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">The EU requirements provide for a multi-stage procedure:</seg>
<seg id="599">First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be determined.</seg>
<seg id="600">Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and possess the necessary professional and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="601">Companies that have been legally convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, must in principle be excluded from participating in the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="602">The offers of the non-excluded bidders are to be examined computationally, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.</seg>
<seg id="604">The examination and evaluation of bids is a phase of the award procedure that is particularly susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, bidders can be unfairly excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the valuation result can be impermissibly affected and thus the determination of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="607">The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons entrusted with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.</seg>
<seg id="608">It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and of the decisions taken.</seg>
<seg id="609">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="611">In accordance with EU requirements, the offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements for the companies' proof of suitability to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the announcements or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">After checking the bidder's suitability, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.</seg>
<seg id="614">The evaluation must be limited to the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The submitted offers must first be formally examined immediately to determine whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.</seg>
<seg id="616">If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the valuation of the offers results in a price that appears to be unreasonably low, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.</seg>
<seg id="618">The decisions made during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="619">Divergent rules</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.</seg>
<seg id="621">The review of the offers as well as the arithmetical examination of the offers may only be carried out by the awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="622">It must only appoint staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.</seg>
<seg id="623">The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.</seg>
<seg id="624">If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the awarding bodies.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be formed for the examination and evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees prepare evaluation reports with award proposals.</seg>
<seg id="628">Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the awarding of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="629">If evidence or declarations required for the submission of bids in Germany are only incompletely submitted, the awarding authority shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether to give bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.</seg>
<seg id="634">If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of too low or too high prices for partial services, the bidder shall be requested to clarify these ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id="635">If he does not succeed and the awarding authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer shall be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases for the construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.</seg>
<seg id="638">A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">A surcharge may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more offers fall below the correct price determination of the client or the offer sums of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their offers.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, the awarding authority may exclude the bids in question.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after the assessment of cost-effectiveness, if only non-reasonable offers at low prices are available.</seg>
<seg id="643">In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge for offers with prices substantially above the calculation of the customer cannot be refused for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">The latter has to decide on the measures to be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supervisory authority at the leading level must, for example, also agree to construction work in excess of EUR 50,000 if a contract is to be awarded freehand, if a contract is not to be awarded to the bid with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Suitability and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">The vast majority of the audited procurement procedures complied with the listed requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">For some companies proposed by freelancers, the awarding bodies did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being complete.</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, it was not clear whether the awarding authority had taken into account all the announced award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "prize" criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons in the examination of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="657">For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacities in the respective areas.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, the freelancers commissioned with the examination of the offers also involved employees who were not obligated to the secrecy of the offers and to the conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="660">For the construction services, it was usually not clear whether the services offered by the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and computational review of offers</seg>
<seg id="662">Some awarding bodies handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without first having carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and having documented their results.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="664">In the examined documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partly not or only insufficiently marked.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">In the case of a sample in a building administration, the most favourable offers deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs in three quarters of the audited procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="667">Every 20th award procedure was cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">Not all bid reviews and clarification discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, more detailed explanations were lacking, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.</seg>
<seg id="670">The deviations were often only justified on a flat-rate basis, e.g. by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction services explained that the detection and verification of mixed calculations was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of a tender by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined estimated value of these services.</seg>
<seg id="673">More detailed calculation tests or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="674">In a clarification meeting, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then commissioned company.</seg>
<seg id="675">Thus, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or the offer price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the client rated the commissioned company as a "cheap company" that could not maintain quality or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another tender, a construction site awarded the contract for an offer whose price was 35% above the value of the cost calculation.</seg>
<seg id="678">It did not lift the invitation to tender and cited the extraneous justification that this company could be concluded on an adequate calculation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">In an audited building administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders in a call for tenders was identical, so that the awarding authority excluded both bids from the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="682">The tests did not raise any significant objections with regard to the application of the remaining provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="684">Aptitude test</seg>
<seg id="685">In many of the examined construction projects, including university construction, road construction and the expansion of the railway network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Scoring</seg>
<seg id="687">When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the awarding authority did not take the specified evaluation criteria into account when examining and evaluating the bids.</seg>
<seg id="688">In a construction project for the expansion of the railway network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of road maintenance measures, the specified criterion “shortening of the construction phase” was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the reduction offered was not sufficiently taken into account by the bidders in second and third position.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the offer selection</seg>
<seg id="692">In three procurement procedures in the context of housing promotion, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.</seg>
<seg id="693">During the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller contracts of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.</seg>
<seg id="694">Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="696">The regulations for the examination and evaluation of offers in both countries comply with the requirements of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved differ from each other.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, the procedure is more closely regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, in some of the procurement procedures examined, it had to be established that essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of bids were not or only insufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="701">Without traceability and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly serious defect was the handover of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in further proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="703">If contracting authorities carry out tasks in the examination and evaluation of offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">When assessing the adequacy of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, complaints arose in particular with regard to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Conclusion of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After checking and evaluating the bids, the award procedure is concluded by awarding the surcharge or by cancelling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">Companies have the opportunity to examine the intended award in the case of notification by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or, in the case of other means of communication, within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="711">A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.</seg>
<seg id="712">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="713">If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, a contract can only be concluded after the final decision in the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.</seg>
<seg id="715">The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the client to observe procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="716">In order to do so, he must document the procedure sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="717">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it may not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="722">The Customer shall place the order within the announced surcharge period,</seg>
<seg id="723">Also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="724">In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may in principle not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="725">The losing bidders must be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for not taking their bids into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="726">Award procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g. if the bid prices are excessive or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="727">Divergent rules</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, there is a 10- or 15-day obligation to provide information and wait before awarding a contract, even for construction work not to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, these requirements only apply to the area of EU-wide procurement.</seg>
<seg id="730">In the other proceedings in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the contract has been awarded.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, an award procedure must be cancelled if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valid bid, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economically viable.</seg>
<seg id="733">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="736">Some companies have already received order letters for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may result in the invalidity of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In individual cases, order letters according to open procedures also contained content deviating from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, the client did not comply with the surcharge periods.</seg>
<seg id="739">In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to carry out the services at the originally offered price after the end of the surcharge period.</seg>
<seg id="740">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the awarding authority deviated from the content of the bidder's offer in the contract.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some contracts, such as construction work for road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after expiry of the legal deadline.</seg>
<seg id="743">When awarding construction services for the renovation of former military sites, the awarding authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after expiry of the statutory period.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the EU requirements for the conclusion of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of losing applicants or bidders increases the instruments for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, the deadlines for placing orders were found to have been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In future, building administrations should avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.</seg>
<seg id="753">In the case of EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.</seg>
<seg id="754">The order data is also recorded in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="756">A carefully and promptly created documentation only enables the traceability of the award decisions.</seg>
<seg id="757">In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to justify award decisions in detail significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">The announcement of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be submitted by the respective contracting authority to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual EU statistics through which it can obtain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.</seg>
<seg id="763">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar regulations</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements on documentation and reporting obligations into national law.</seg>
<seg id="766">The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Divergent rules</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the publication obligation for awarded contracts is not limited to EU-wide procurement, but also extends to other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notice period is shortened to 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for limited tenders and for hands-free awards from value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without value added tax (so-called ex-post transparency).</seg>
<seg id="771">Below these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information about the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="772">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="773">BRH</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.</seg>
<seg id="777">In a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.</seg>
<seg id="778">In a few cases, the documents of the awarding bodies did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="779">Announcements about the placing of orders</seg>
<seg id="780">In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting authorities failed to publicise the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="781">In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had announced the contracts awarded.</seg>
<seg id="782">Reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="783">The statistical lists viewed contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and sent on time.</seg>
<seg id="784">Ex-post transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the audited construction administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the case of a construction management, however, this data was not published due to a transmission error.</seg>
<seg id="787">The building administration noticed this error only after half a year,</seg>
<seg id="788">This means that the contract data of the procurement procedures concluded up to then have not been published.</seg>
<seg id="789">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the evaluation committees.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some minutes of the offer openings were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Announcements about the placing of orders</seg>
<seg id="794">In the case of several road construction projects, announcements about awarded contracts were only published late or not at all.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="796">The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are largely identical in both countries and implement the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="797">In principle, this ensures the transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="798">The regulations to be applied for publication in the Czech Republic go a little further than the requirements in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="799">The deficiencies identified in the documentation and in the notices partially substantially limited the corruption-preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and award of contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two main areas that are essential for the award of construction services by public contracting authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">The provisions of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a European internal market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Anti-corruption measures serve not only to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two Courts of Auditors on the application of public procurement regulations in both countries and the comparison of these regulations reveal similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU public procurement rules</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed the EU requirements for the award of construction services into national law.</seg>
<seg id="809">This gives the Czech Republic and Germany an important common basis for awarding construction services and taking into account the essential requirements of competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">The construction administrations of both countries have partly supported these bids to a very large extent by further administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements for construction works to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="813">The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the objections raised when implementing the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In particular, the audits carried out in the Czech Republic have identified risks affecting the cost-effectiveness of awards.</seg>
<seg id="815">For example, incomplete service descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, cost assessments were usually insufficiently drawn up. Also, excessive qualification requirements reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the case of transport buildings.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">The investigations did not aim to uncover cases of corruption,</seg>
<seg id="818">Also because the Court of Auditors do not have the appropriate instruments for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">When it comes to preventing corruption, both countries have set different priorities.</seg>
<seg id="821">Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements in the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The main aim of the Czech regulations is to increase the transparency of procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="826">In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very precisely how the bids to prevent corruption are to be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is a suitable instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interventions.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analyses and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organizational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.</seg>
<seg id="830">The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">The building authorities should continue to train their employees on the requirements for preventing corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.</seg>
<seg id="833">A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.</seg>
<seg id="835">Tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should therefore only be transferred to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against impermissible interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="837">At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption in which public procurement is the most important component.</seg>
<seg id="838">The Public Procurement Act and the associated implementing provisions have been substantially amended.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audits of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, as the awarding bodies will have to justify the cost-effectiveness of the award of contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the assessments, and properly document and publish all these aspects.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">The NKÚ and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both courts of auditors call on the building authorities in their countries to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and take appropriate countermeasures.</seg>
<seg id="847">The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="848">A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a favourable effect on bid prices, provided that this leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient procurement by public contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, procurement procedures are carried out by specialised construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks – with the exception of transport construction projects – are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.</seg>
<seg id="851">The courts of auditors of both countries have the concern, even after completion of their joint project, to further develop the findings that are important to them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.</seg>
<seg id="852">Both Courts of Auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) at international level, because the principles and findings presented are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the audit</seg>
<seg id="3">Preface</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes are the most important source of income for public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="5">The work of the Court of Auditors should therefore focus on the examination of this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">This applies in particular to VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">This alone results in annual tax losses in the European Union of an estimated EUR 100 billion1.</seg>
<seg id="8">Already at the 6th EUROSAI Congress 2005 in Bonn, the participants pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">This enables the courts of auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and optimize audit practice.</seg>
<seg id="10">Value added tax (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2006, the courts of auditors of both states audited for the first time in parallel in the area of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="12">The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, there is a need for close cooperation between the Court of Auditors, which will allow a comprehensive assessment of whether the measures taken are appropriate to deal with VAT fraud effectively.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two courts of auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Examination number:(CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of VAT (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKÚ), control audit</seg>
<seg id="18">Aim of the examination:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The VAT administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities for intergovernmental administrative assistance should be examined.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The purpose of the audit was to evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, further examination fields - linked to the VAT - should be processed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The findings made here should be compared in order to determine whether the taxation procedures can be optimised.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audit period covered the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period prior to the audit period up to the conclusion of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination</seg>
<seg id="25">The Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit for the administration of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the previous parallel investigation, they had identified suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,</seg>
<seg id="27">Which appeared for the purpose of a further examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the audit findings, the two courts of auditors made recommendations on the administration of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aim of the control review was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the identified suspected cases should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also dealt with other matters. These included selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of VAT claims and the VAT audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Court of Auditors found that:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous examination</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the registration procedures for VAT in the two states and found differences that caused problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Court of Auditors therefore recommended that the registration of taxable persons within the EU be harmonised.</seg>
<seg id="36">This has also been taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798/2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the VAT identification number.</seg>
<seg id="38">The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible deletion.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Court of Auditors expected Member States to agree, in accordance with their decision in principle, on appropriate rules to remove unreliable traders from the VAT system as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the latest version of the draft.</seg>
<seg id="41">The above-mentioned common rules are no longer included, and the two Courts of Auditors regret this.</seg>
<seg id="42">They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary notifications As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended to Member States that summary notifications (CMs) should in future be submitted on a monthly basis.</seg>
<seg id="44">The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed more promptly.</seg>
<seg id="45">The deadline for the surrender of CMs has been reduced to one month by Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the implementation only entered into force on 1 July 2010. Thus, it has not transposed the obligation for the monthly submission of the ZM into national law in due time.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Data comparison of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the consolidation of the procedures for VAT pre-registrations and ZM The German tax administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work is not yet complete.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Exchange on successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level During the first audit, the two Court of Auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Court of Auditors focused on German participation in the “Platform for Risk Management”.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Control audit of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the first audit, the Court of Auditors had jointly examined transactions for which it was doubtful whether they had actually been executed or which had been explained differently by the taxpayers of the two states in the prior VAT declarations (or VAT declarations) or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits by the tax offices (FÄ) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit showed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. The respective tax administrations had taken appropriate measures to this end (e.g. subsequent fixing of VAT or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between taxable persons in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is used to identify high-risk taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in data exchange within the framework of EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the point of view of an active participating State, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to actively participate.</seg>
<seg id="67">As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with a German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the selected sales, the NKU identified both normal business transactions and those with suspected VAT fraud, including carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="69">The FÄ could examine sales with high risk only to a limited extent. This applied in particular with so-called „Missing Traders “, whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports</seg>
<seg id="71">It is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany and a number of other countries have rejected active participation in EUROCANET because, from their point of view, there is no sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Federal Court of Auditors found that the German financial administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="74">However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU agreed on a draft Regulation:</seg>
<seg id="76">Created by the Eurofisc.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of receivables</seg>
<seg id="79">Intergovernmental mutual assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, requests for intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are processed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Federal Court of Auditors and the NKU compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">These statistics contained inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two Court of Auditors consider it useful to have a renewed discussion on the statistics at EU level in order to avoid any remaining discrepancies in the future.</seg>
<seg id="84">If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">Both Court of Auditors consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Commission should support the Member States in this, if so desired.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. VAT testing at large companies</seg>
<seg id="90">The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large companies in both states.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the financial administrations that they considered important in this context.</seg>
<seg id="92">It became clear that the situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="93">The CZ has a system for selecting high-risk cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, data from balance sheets, and profit and loss statements).</seg>
<seg id="94">The VAT control can thus be effectively controlled and analysed as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="95">A special tax office for large enterprises is to be set up in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is still no comparable system in Germany. This makes it difficult to control and analyse VAT control as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="97">The German financial administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="98">Various risk management components, which are still to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">Division II - State Budget Revenue and Regional Divisions IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited in the period from May 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="102">Audited bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FA in Hodonín, FA in Hradec Králové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA in Písek, FA in Pilsen, FA Prague 1, FA Prague 4, FA Prague 8, FA in Rakovník, FA in Sokolov, FA in Tábor, FA in Vysoké Mýto, FA in Zlín and FA in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Examination procedure in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich examined from February 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:</seg>
<seg id="107">• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. They also conducted interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files from the following departments were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits of large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, discussions were held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Federal Court of Auditors informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors</seg>
<seg id="112">Prior to the parallel audit, the representatives of both Court of Auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">In December 2008, the Presidents of both Courts of Auditors signed the agreement on cooperation in the parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams informed themselves about the initial results obtained during the preparation of the examination, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The audit teams exchanged the audit knowledge gained up to then and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint audit report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two courts of auditors defined the following topics for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and from Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • Review of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany; • Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Examination of the administration of VAT in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint audit</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Implementation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU Supported</seg>
<seg id="124">Based on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended adjusting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for the cancellation of registration in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="125">These amended rules should more effectively reduce the risk of possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="126">In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxable persons if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No. 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Act”).</seg>
<seg id="127">So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to require the FÄ to be cancelled if taxpayers repeatedly fail to file VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the Czech VAT Act, the FA may ex officio cancel the registration of a taxable person if a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for this; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the requirements for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="129">The first examination had shown that, due to the existing legal situation, FA Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration of “foreign taxable persons”3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxable persons because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">Accordingly, the FA is entitled to delete the registration of a foreign taxpayer if he has provided neither taxable nor tax-exempt deliveries of goods or services entitled to input tax deduction in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly delivery of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="135">On the basis of the first audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle for the delivery of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The ZM must now be submitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="138">In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) VAT Act are provided for a person registered in another Member State as subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="139">The prerequisite for this is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the location of the service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation referred to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically compares the data on intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">The proper collection of VAT is a sine qua non for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">Therefore, the fight against VAT fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.</seg>
<seg id="148">In it, an external expert estimated the VAT loss incurred for the 25 Member States in the period 2000 to 2006. After evaluation of the available data, the tax loss for this period was estimated at EUR 90 to 113 billion, on the basis that the EU-25 lose an average of 12% of the turnover taxes they are entitled to each year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first audit found that a Member State cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).</seg>
<seg id="153">Risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxable persons within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected for this purpose (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The aim of the Eurofisc network is to optimise administrative assistance in tax matters and to combat VAT fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities is to be improved in order to detect fraud as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later, Eurofisc could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council6 already approved Eurofisc on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.</seg>
<seg id="157">EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for Eurofisc.</seg>
<seg id="158">The purpose of the system is to detect risky transactions and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations in the first report led to the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers on the basis of a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system itself is constantly being improved.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data provided in the questionnaire are now collected electronically and are later available for research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission had made a proposal8 to amend Regulation 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="168">There was still a need for clarification and clarification from the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly delivery of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, a law9 on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="173">It contains, inter alia, provisions on the monthly payment of CMs for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="174">And will enter into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-applications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the VAT pre-applications and the ZM</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint federal-state working group has been set up,</seg>
<seg id="178">Which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the VAT pre-registration and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="179">The concept is still being discussed with the countries.</seg>
<seg id="180">This working group has also dealt with a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level Relevant information is exchanged at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported this initiative and, in the written procedure of 18 October 2006, initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the "Fiscalis 2006-2007" action plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • Risk management tools, • Influencing the behaviour of taxpayers, • Evaluation, • Updating the guide to risk management.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports from the subgroups “Risk Management Instruments” and “Updating the Risk Management Guide” were published at the beginning of 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The question of the requirements for VAT registration and its deletion in different countries was dealt with at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amended Council Regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="192">The questions of registration and deletion are reserved to the national legislation of the EU Member States until further notice.</seg>
<seg id="193">There was still a need for clarification and clarification from the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Member States reached political agreement on the latest version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="196">Common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons are no longer included.</seg>
<seg id="197">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="198">The two courts of auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly delivery of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="201">With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous examination, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of CMs in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the cycle for the payment of the corresponding CMs to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not implement the commitment to the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus not on time, while the CZ complied with the requirements of the EU.</seg>

<seg id="206">The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify high-risk entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">The Federal Audit Office focused on German participation in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Control audit of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">The first audit jointly examined transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether discrepancies had been found in the declarations made by taxpayers in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two Court of Auditors selected for the control examination nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for which the tax examination by the tax authorities of the Member State in question had not been completed at the time of the previous joint examination.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">A Czech taxable person purchased goods worth €22,686 from a German taxable person in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxable person did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration, as the German taxable person did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for domestic German transactions.</seg>
<seg id="218">Through international administrative assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not require a VAT identification number in order to benefit from the tax exemption for intra-Community goods deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="219">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to an audit by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods of the above-mentioned value and at the same time asserting his right to pre-tax deduction of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">A Czech taxable person is alleged to have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">However, he stated that he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not declare them in his VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="223">Citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German financial administration refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech FA was unable to obtain any documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax determination remained in place.</seg>
<seg id="225">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous reports from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the delivery of the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxable person acquired the goods from the Slovak taxable person and stated the purchase in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">A Czech taxable person is alleged to have purchased a car worth EUR 48 500 from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, it did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, he had not issued a VAT declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information transmitted from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA requested the taxpayer in March 2007 to file a subsequent tax return, but the taxpayer failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="232">As a result of the inspection, it was established that the FA had carried out further audit actions in this tax case in 2007. It had established that the car in question had been sold by the taxable person to a used car dealer in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the December 2004 taxation period, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="234">The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings concerning the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be irrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">A Czech taxpayer is said to have delivered new vehicles (cars) with a total value of 198 167 euros to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="238">In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, it was stated that tax criminal proceedings were pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">The Federal Audit Office's audit showed that, after the conclusion of the proceedings, there was evidence of the German taxpayer's involvement in fraud.</seg>
<seg id="240">The intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to employment taxation in the amount of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information provided by the German tax authorities, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods of April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">Based on the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA fixed additional VAT in the amount of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">Czech taxpayer A is alleged to have purchased a machine with a total value of EUR 58 000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="246">The German taxpayer is said to have delivered a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech taxpayer B in the third quarter of 2004. B, however, denied the purchase.</seg>
<seg id="247">The inspection by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with a branch in CZ.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech taxable person A did not specify the purchase of the goods from the German taxable person mentioned in his VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="249">The reply of the German FA to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth EUR 58 000, but a delivery within the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the audit, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as a domestic delivery after completion of an audit and that the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">A German taxable person is alleged to have delivered goods worth 11,600 euros to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration which impermissibly showed purchases from another Member State, including purchases in the above-mentioned amount.</seg>
<seg id="255">The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and fixed additional VAT in the amount of 1,600 euros.</seg>
<seg id="256">Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an examination is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="257">The ZM of the German taxable person has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxable person who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax authorities in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the issue of the purchase of a car worth EUR 47,400 by a Czech taxable person in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After an audit for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA set the Czech taxpayer's tax liability at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech person obliged to pay VAT had been cancelled because he had failed to comply with his tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="262">The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person delivered goods to a Czech taxable person with a total value of EUR 33 205, which he did not declare as an intra-Community purchase.</seg>
<seg id="266">The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer repeatedly made subsequent VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of purchases amounting to CZK 134 273 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this on the grounds that revenues for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated and accepted the VAT declarations made.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">A German taxable person had delivered goods worth 46 854 euros to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA checked the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="273">With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of EUR 31 998, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="274">According to the results of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors, after repeated warnings from the FA in January 2007, the Czech taxpayer had submitted a subsequent VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period.</seg>
<seg id="275">With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct input tax. Therefore, his tax liability for the relevant tax period remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the sales selected for the audit had been completed and that the tax administrations in CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (e.g. subsequent fixing of VAT or prevention of pre-tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be an important source of information for identifying high-risk taxpayers in the Member State of acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the responsible FA at the buyers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on turnover and taxable suppliers deemed to be at risk in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,</seg>
<seg id="283">Which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States, either as suppliers or purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="284">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German financial administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit identified both normal business transactions and those in which there was a suspicion of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">In the cases concerned, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• When examining the early warning information, the FÄ did not detect any suspicion of risky transactions.</seg>
<seg id="290">The taxpayers concerned were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• In the audits of risky transactions, the FÄ did not succeed in using the submitted accounting documents to prove violations of the rules for calculating the tax base and VAT, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with shell companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxable persons did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The competent authorities checked most of the risky taxable persons and transactions mentioned in EUROCANET's early warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="294">However, their options for checking risky sales, especially so-called “missing traders”, are limited.</seg>
<seg id="295">In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide evidence of fraudulent action on the part of the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="296">Stricter requirements for the registration of taxable persons for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in the deletion of registrations would be helpful to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="297">The taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for VAT purposes in order to fake fictitious deliveries of goods throughout the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to other taxpayers, with which they then assert unjustified claims for deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="298">In the event of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to trace the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Findings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="304">Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is justified by the fact that “from the point of view of the Federal Government</seg>
<seg id="307">No clear legal basis [exists] that would make it possible to break the tax secrecy that exists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Federal Government has no reliable knowledge of how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET."12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Office for Taxes has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the financial authorities of the Federal Government and the Länder on the basis of a coordinated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German tax authorities receive control notifications on the direct business relationships of taxpayers registered in EUROCANET with companies from other EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the respective German FA does not receive any information on whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company based in another Member State, which also has a business relationship with the German company from the control notification.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to actively participate.</seg>
<seg id="314">Accordingly, the examination had to be carried out differently in this area.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, significant differences with regard to the success in detecting VAT fraud could not be detected. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other tools at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13 establishing Eurofisc, a network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by the Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemption for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of receivables</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 Intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">Legislation on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:</seg>
<seg id="324">Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and customs duties and relating to VAT and certain excise duties; and</seg>
<seg id="326">Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain articles of Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">The CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308/EEC through Act No. 252/2000 on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, this too had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, the aforementioned law had to be amended.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, Amendment No. 191/2004 on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new piece of relevant legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all sent documents with the respective original.</seg>
<seg id="332">The main principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. The principle of reciprocity applies;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. Administrative assistance shall always be provided only on request and if all conditions are met;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. Administrative assistance shall not extend to claims which constitute a criminal sanction in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. The procedure of intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. Administrative assistance shall only be provided for the recovery of undisputed claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. The principle of exhaustion applies: the requesting State shall use all means to which it is entitled under national law to recover the claim.</seg>
<seg id="340">Law No. 191/2004 provides for three forms of administrative assistance: provision of information, notification of legal acts and actual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The competent FA shall transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery together with the relevant documents electronically via the relevant Financial Directorate to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the relevant language, scans it with all attachments and sends it via the communication network or the common interface CCN/CSI of the competent financial authority of the State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="344">A request for recovery assistance must meet the following condition: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for incoming requests from other Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">The receipt of requests from other Member States must be confirmed by the CZ Ministry of Finance as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.</seg>
<seg id="348">If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="349">The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will check whether the request meets all legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="351">Thereafter, it shall transmit the request to the competent FA via the financial directorate concerned. If the request for recovery is granted, the FA shall, among other things, determine the financial circumstances of the debtor, e.g. by means of excerpts from the land register, information about existing bank accounts and registration of motor vehicles with the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="352">After six months from the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="353">The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons concerned cannot be reached and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="354">All sums successfully collected must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of collection.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech FA dealing with the recovery may, with the consent of the requesting State, agree on the claim for hours or payment in installments.</seg>
<seg id="356">The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of default pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 on the Administration of Taxes and Fees</seg>
<seg id="357">Belong to the requesting State.</seg>
<seg id="358">In 2006 and 2007 in particular, the CZ Ministry of Finance delayed sending the requests for recovery to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="359">The same applied to the forwarding of requests for recovery made by the Czech FÄ to the competent authority in the requested state.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the Act on Intergovernmental Administrative Assistance for the Recovery of Claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="361">The situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">In accordance with § 13 (4) of Law 191/2004, the CZ Ministry of Finance prepares statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This includes the number of requests submitted in the previous year and received for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims.</seg>
<seg id="364">On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission is preparing its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit showed that in 2008 the CZ Ministry of Finance under-reported the claims by 5 250 000 euros. The reason was the incorrect indication of the amount of a VAT claim submitted in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual recovery assistance is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 Intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of receivables in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal basis for intergovernmental administrative assistance in tax matters is the Community standards Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive)14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178/2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Contributions Directive codified Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197616, whose provisions had been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">It regulates, among other things, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and default surcharges.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC)17 of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated in the Tax Code (AO).</seg>
<seg id="374">§ 117 paragraph 2 AO provides that the financial authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal norms of the European Communities applicable in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Official Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of the AO (§§ 249-346) contains the legal provisions for the enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative actions of the financial authorities regulate in particular the enforcement and enforcement instructions.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the supreme financial authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own responsibility in this area to the Federal Central Office for Taxation18.</seg>
<seg id="378">General conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery assistance are:</seg>
<seg id="379">• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (§§ 251, 254 AO).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All recovery funds available in Germany have been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• The claims for the recovery of which administrative assistance is requested are incontestable.</seg>
<seg id="382">• The period between the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became incontestable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The claim must be at least 1,500 euros.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States German requests for the recovery of outstanding taxes are forwarded by the FÄ's enforcement authorities via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Tax Office of the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.</seg>
<seg id="385">The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental administrative assistance in tax collection (collection) of 19 January 200419.</seg>
<seg id="386">This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new Recovery Directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">In addition to attachments, the request will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the funding authority.</seg>
<seg id="388">The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If not, the request will be returned to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="390">Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Tax Office will then take over the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedure for incoming requests from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="393">Requests for recovery from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a confirmation of receipt within ten days.</seg>
<seg id="394">It also checks whether the formal requirements are met.</seg>
<seg id="395">In principle, the Federal Central Tax Office forwards these requests to the funding authority, which forwards them to the relevant FA and monitors the completion.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Office for Taxes also sends interim and final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it reminds the funding authority of the obligation to submit an interim report in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EC.</seg>
<seg id="398">After examination of the formal and substantive conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies shall announce relevant measures.</seg>
<seg id="399">All amounts collected must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.</seg>
<seg id="400">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="401">Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).</seg>
<seg id="402">4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases</seg>
<seg id="403">A total of 21 intergovernmental requests for recovery between the CZ and Germany were selected for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="404">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT debts of a Czech taxpayer from the years 2004 and 2005 in the total amount of 3 883 euros (109 820 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="407">It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a land lien.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since the encumbered property was not sufficient to settle the entire tax liability, an installment payment agreement in the amount of at least CZK 2,000 per month was made with the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31 August 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. Accordingly, the taxpayer had in the meantime settled tax debts in the amount of CZK 49 600 (as of 25 August 2009).</seg>
<seg id="411">The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on 28 August 2009, a further CZK 3,000 was transferred.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling EUR 180 869 (= CZK 4 434 915).</seg>
<seg id="414">It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="415">After checking the bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have any attachable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">On-site investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the concentration camp were unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This notification was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT together with interest and fees amounting to a total of 3 139 euros (= 84 846 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="421">It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance was informed from Germany that the Czech tax debtor had in the meantime settled the debt.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case was closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully paid his debt in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Because of the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to forward the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of collection by the competent Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was determined that the amount contributed will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounts to 6 649 euros and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only one request for recovery in the amount of EUR 3 139 for the company concerned. The request for recovery in the amount of EUR 6 649 could not be found there.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling EUR 39 957 = CZK 956 654.</seg>
<seg id="429">It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="430">The recovery procedure was initiated on 1 June 2009 and a decision was taken on the attachment of the Czech bank balance and the debtor’s salary (CZK 7 000).</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech FA, the debtor had in the past been willing to pay 250 euros a month, but the responsible German FA did not agree.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxpayer agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA to agree on a different amount.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax for the year 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling EUR 113 444 = CZK 3 116 304.</seg>
<seg id="437">Only on 14 November 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to FA Prague 1, which is authorised to deal with tax cases of taxable persons not resident in the CZ; on the basis of the available address, a locally competent FA could not be determined.</seg>
<seg id="438">During its investigation on 19 September 2008, the FA received information and documents stating that the debtor’s income amounted to 4,704 euros. However, it was unable to issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the debtor's assets to credit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of a VAT debt together with procedural costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.</seg>
<seg id="443">It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA transferred the amount of EUR 17 700 = CZK 439 226 to the Czech authorities via the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="445">When checking the amounts collected, a conversion error was discovered.</seg>
<seg id="446">The amount to be recovered of 146 223 742 CZK was converted at the exchange rate of 1 euro = 25.065 CZK, but a comma error resulted in an amount of 583 378 euros.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct amount to be recovered amounted to 5 833 782 euros.</seg>
<seg id="448">As a result, a request for recovery which was too low by EUR 5 250 404 was made.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery in respect of a VAT debt together with interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.</seg>
<seg id="451">It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="452">The German FA ordered the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.</seg>
<seg id="453">Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's revenues in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability. On 8 April 2009 - EUR 4 600, on 6 May 2009 - EUR 3 000 and on 16 June 2009 - EUR 2 500.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were transferred to the account of the responsible FA in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA by 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling EUR 398 653 = CZK 9 832 779, including real estate transfer tax.</seg>
<seg id="458">It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="459">The request was returned in a letter from the German financial administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax authorities justified this on the grounds that the transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">In addition, Article 2(g) concerns liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and assets not referred to in Article 1, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new recovery request to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the transfer tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but instead the arrears in VAT, corporate and income tax.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA forwarded to the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328.</seg>
<seg id="467">The VAT debt amounted to 1 133 967 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="468">It was not until 18 April 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="469">And it was not until 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the reply of the German financial administration of 9 July 2007 to the Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="470">According to which the German FA had issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account on 11 June 2007. The bank announced that it was not in a business relationship with the named taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="471">Thus, the request for the German financial administration was deemed to have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery of VAT debts totalling CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The competent Finance Directorate submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German financial administration on 15 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before submitting the request, the Czech FA enforced the tax claim by seizing bank accounts and salary attachments, as well as by debiting a piece of land.</seg>
<seg id="477">Prior to the request for recovery, a request for information was sent to the German tax authorities on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">According to the reply letter of 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities amounting to 8 437 euros. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery and did not pass this on to the competent Czech FA until 12 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="479">According to this, the tax liability in Germany is irrecoverable due to the insolvency of the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="480">No assets had been found, the income from non-self-employment was already the subject of other enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German financial administration thus regarded the request as settled.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of recovery, the provisions of EU law apply to all EU Member States for intergovernmental administrative assistance.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in CZ and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The Federal Court of Auditors and NKÚ compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">There were disagreements.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States prepare their statistics with greater care.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a greater number of requests for assistance, discrepancies in the statistics had been reduced.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both Court of Auditors consider it useful to have a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics so that the remaining discrepancies can be avoided in the future.</seg>
<seg id="490">If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the Court of Auditors consider that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amounts collected per Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by Member States, the Commission could help Member States to assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors argue that Member States with low rates should aim for at least the average recovery rate within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.</seg>
<seg id="495">The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the competent authorities with a delay, in particular in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="496">The same applies to the requests for recovery made by the Czech FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="497">The examination showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance violated Law No. 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance insofar as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Value Added Tax Examination for Large Enterprises</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 VAT audit of large companies in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General</seg>
<seg id="501">The taxation procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="502">The audit of large enterprises is regulated by the Czech Act No. 337/1992, the “Tax and Fee Management Act”.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have established a business or legal persons who have been established to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the relevant tax period amounts to at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.</seg>
<seg id="504">The taxable person is classified as a large company based on the level of turnover according to the income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A natural or legal person is no longer managed as a large company for turnover tax purposes if in three consecutive assessment periods its net turnover in the tax period amounts to less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period, for which the requirements were met for the first time according to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="506">A taxable person can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been previously assessed for a tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">By the end of 2009, all large companies had been audited at least every five years.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on proper tax determination and collection.</seg>
<seg id="509">The audits by the FÄ should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="510">The taxable large companies were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the responsible FÄ, which were set up at a total of 13 FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="511">A special audit office carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the instructions of the Head of the Finance Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition, it also examined</seg>
<seg id="513">Taxable persons with unusual and special business activities and</seg>
<seg id="514">Those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.</seg>
<seg id="515">Taxable persons with a complex distribution of locations and organisational structure are also examined,</seg>
<seg id="516">Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion</seg>
<seg id="517">As well as taxable persons belonging to chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information on the number of audits carried out by the special audit bodies of the FÄ and the additional tax results of these audits are shown in Table No. 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No. 531/1990 for the regional financial authorities. In particular, it proposes the establishment of a special tax office with nationwide jurisdiction for selected taxable persons (legal persons established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Examination of value added tax at large companies in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General</seg>
<seg id="522">The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. For company audits, the general regulations apply • the Abgabenordnung (AO), • the Finanzverwaltungsgesetz (FVG) and • the Betriebsprüfungsordnung (BPO).</seg>
<seg id="523">There are also work aids.</seg>
<seg id="524">Order of taxation</seg>
<seg id="525">The provisions of §§ 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 -External Audit" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its substantive scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the audit announcement, audit principles, the taxpayer's obligation to cooperate and requirements for final discussions as well as for the transmission of the audit report.</seg>
<seg id="526">External inspections are carried out by the competent FÄ (§ 195 AO).</seg>
<seg id="527">Financial Administration Act According to § 5 paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with § 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Office for Taxes to participate in external audits of the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and scope of this cooperation will be agreed between the authorities involved.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuer) may require that certain well-known companies be audited at a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="530">In this case, it can lay down rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="531">Audit Regulations Pursuant to Article 108 paragraph 7 GG, the Audit Regulations (BpO 2000) were issued with the approval of the Federal Council.</seg>
<seg id="532">It applies to external audits of the state tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">In accordance with § 3 BPO, the companies are regularly classified into size classes.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large companies are to be subjected to a follow-up inspection (Section 4.2 BPO).</seg>
<seg id="535">In accordance with Section 33.1 BPO, each competent financial authority must maintain a group directory within the meaning of the regulation.</seg>
<seg id="536">Working aids for the administration</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the following work aids have been issued for the administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">• “Unified Manual for the VAT Special Examination”;</seg>
<seg id="539">• TurnoverTax-Country-Online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with instructions on how to use the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;</seg>
<seg id="540">• Work aids for difficult and special situations.</seg>
<seg id="541">• Central database for the storage and evaluation of VAT fraud cases and development of risk profiles -ZAUBER;</seg>
<seg id="542">Taxpayers are classified into size classes based on criteria such as turnover and profit, although the limit values vary depending on the line of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies - not just large companies - can be determined on a regular basis (last cut-off date: 1 January 2010).</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, large companies have to be thoroughly checked.</seg>
<seg id="547">The tests are announced and usually also extend to the VAT,</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income or corporation tax as well as trade and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="549">The sales tax can be checked either by company auditors or VAT special auditors.</seg>
<seg id="550">The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of each country.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">The BPO 2000 assumes a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes to which a company has been assessed are subject to the audit.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit at large companies</seg>
<seg id="555">In accordance with the agreement, both courts of auditors did not examine individual cases. They investigated the question of how the tax administrations proceed with the VAT audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="556">With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the tax administrations that is essential for the audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="557">• Which statistical records and evaluations for the VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between VAT fraud control and general VAT testing?</seg>
<seg id="560">CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there any statistics or records on the timeliness of the exams?</seg>
<seg id="563">CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community purchases of selected VAT payers is recorded in the ATIS system;</seg>
<seg id="564">The same applies to information about the start and end of the FA examination.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the statistics for auditors compiled at federal level only contain information on the so-called average last audit period (year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not provide an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT special auditors concentrate on the last VAT investment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.</seg>
<seg id="568">The federal statistics for VAT special auditors do not contain any information on the size class of the audited company.</seg>
<seg id="569">• Are there statistics or records of the type of surplus result; e.g. divided by:</seg>
<seg id="570">I. genuine additional result (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general VAT rate)</seg>
<seg id="571">II. improper surplus result (e.g. relocation/postponement of a matter not objectionable under VAT law to another tax period)</seg>
<seg id="572">III. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed surplus result)</seg>
<seg id="573">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the tax surplus broken down by tax type, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Regardless of this, the amount of subsequent payments and incoming payments are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics on tax debts are broken down by type of tax. However, no distinction is made between tax debts incurred as a result of a tax return and those resulting from the FA's audit activities.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not differ according to the above criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Most financial authorities, where local surveys were carried out, did not differentiate in this respect either.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are the relevant examination fields recorded?</seg>
<seg id="581">CZ: Yes, the FA can select test cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, the finance ministries of the Federal Government and the Länder have agreed on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="585">Accordingly, auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result achieved by them in ZAUBER if a certain threshold value is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. on the origin of the additional VAT result obtained.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="589">- Taxable large companies have claimed unauthorized input tax deduction for purchased deliveries and services,</seg>
<seg id="590">• which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity in accordance with § 72 (1) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which were used for representation expenses in accordance with § 75 (3) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="592">• due to invoices that do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG</seg>
<seg id="593">- taxable large companies have omitted the registration of VAT to be paid as provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="596">Findings on VAT from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.</seg>
<seg id="597">The Federal Central Tax Office can, however, evaluate the ZAUBER database, into which auditors and tax investigators of the federal states have to enter the additional tax result achieved by them if a certain threshold value is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the financial administration analyse relevant audit areas and draw consequences for strategic management?</seg>
<seg id="599">CZ: Yes, for example, nationwide inspections are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide any information on particularly “energetic” examination fields.</seg>
<seg id="602">With regard to the analysis of such information, the benefits and the manner of its further use, there were different views among the survey bodies.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some senior financial directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but the FÄ are free to use it or not.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">As a result, it should be noted that large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss calculations are processed in the system.</seg>
<seg id="606">The CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases based on a wide range of information.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT audits in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In the CZ, the establishment of a special finance office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="610">Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="611">The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.</seg>

<seg id="613">On the basis of the information in VAT pre-applications or VAT declarations as well as examination instructions, qualified examiners select the cases to be examined and ensure the appropriate taxation.</seg>
<seg id="614">In order to reduce VAT revenue losses and at the same time increase the risk of detection for unreliable entrepreneurs, appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be introduced.</seg>

<seg id="617">5. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation between the two courts of auditors has proved its worth.</seg>
<seg id="619">In this way, it was possible to gain necessary insights into the systems used in both countries: This concerns in particular: • intra-community sales, • risk management at VAT, in particular with regard to the selection of risky sales, • recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="620">The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting VAT fraud and in the systems described above.</seg>
<seg id="621">These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="622">They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested parties as to which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud. This applies, for example, to the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The experience and knowledge gained should encourage us to continue to examine the administration of VAT together in the future.</seg>
