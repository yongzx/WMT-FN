<seg id="3">High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and increasing living standards in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economic passenger and freight transport is an important task for the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="6">It requires a high degree of organizational, technical and financial effort.</seg>
<seg id="7">The establishment and development of a sustainable European transport infrastructure often requires difficult compromises with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="9">When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can, through careful action and decision-making, save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of state auditing authorities is to identify defects that stand in the way of optimum cost-effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of administrations to the shortcomings that have been identified, but also propose improvements for the benefit of citizens and for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) and the Nejvyi kontrolnad (NK), carried out parallel audits of the expenditure for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (motorway D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.</seg>
<seg id="15">The co-operation with the NKE enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the course of the cooperation with the BRH, the NKx received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">In line with the planning progress, the date of completion was finally set for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the award procedure, however, the Road and Highway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">For this, however, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint audit activity, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.</seg>
<seg id="24">A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square meter.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis showed that the border bridge under the large bridges with lengths of over 100 m was the most expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of delays in awarding contracts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The comparison of the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">In future audits of the cost-effectiveness of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH as well as NKE can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both audit offices recommend standardizing bridge constructions and carrying out steel composite and special constructions only where reinforced concrete constructions are unsuitable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The test process was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of this report is the parallel testing of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The focus of the audit was on cost-effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel tests were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the National Chamber of Commerce in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="36">in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">It examined the economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of expenditure on the borderline section 0807 of the D8 motorway, amounting to approximately CZK 20 billion gross (approx. EUR 690 million).</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, EUR 64 million will be made available from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005 independently of the parallel tests with the NK.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of approximately 670 million euros, 277 million euros will be co-financed by European Funds (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The Prague – Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Corridor IV Dresden – Central and Southeastern Europe – Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech/German border,</seg>
<seg id="43">the A 17 from the border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the test, the border sections of the motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 on the Czech side remains incomplete, since the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">Here the crossing of a protected landscape area in the Bohemian Central Mountains is planned.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the traffic volume in 2008 in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will amount to 22,940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 to be around 25,000 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed an agreement to merge the German A17 motorway and the Czech D8 motorway on the common state border by erecting a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction measure represented an important aspect of the parallel audits of both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and NK</seg>
<seg id="53">From mid-2005, the two courts of auditors jointly considered cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.</seg>
<seg id="58">There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">In order to be able to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8, the NKx had no comparative data at its disposal.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">It also had to check the effectiveness of the expenditure. To this end, the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels should be examined, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">After preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courts of auditors closed on 04. January 2006 an agreement on the coordination of the tests of the motorway Prague – Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="64">The auditors of both audit institutions met in the course of 2006 at about six to eight-week intervals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for checking bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and produced joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">A key aspect of the cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH mainly focused on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKO mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs, and so does the way in which the two audit bodies complete their audits.</seg>
<seg id="69">For this reason, both authorities drew up separate national reports on their audit results.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communique in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge as far as possible in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">Later they postponed the appointment by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as the client of the construction project.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany is co-financing 42.13% of the bridge construction.</seg>
<seg id="77">Initially, the RMD provided for a prestressed concrete construction for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, however, the RMD and its German partner agreed on the construction of a steel composite structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">They justified this decision with the possible reduction of the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the Talaue.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had identified the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, this was based on a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, however, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award procedure, the RMD made serious mistakes,</seg>
<seg id="85">by insufficiently preparing the award documents and describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria inaccurately.</seg>
<seg id="86">These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Evaluation Commission and the Director General of the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="87">An inferior bidder contested the outcome of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation by the Czech Antitrust Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a result, the summer construction season following the offer test was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in less time. This led to a significant price increase.</seg>
<seg id="91">The measures offered included the double assembly of the superstructures, the modification of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally planned steel grade.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel – the higher costs of which were borne by the client alone – made it possible to shorten the construction time intended for corrosion protection and thus the total construction time.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the offer price of approx. EUR 18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further additions will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of around ’5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">The costs are currently approx. 25.9 million euros net (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both audit offices examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterized by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="101">In the preparation of this part of the examination, a precise definition of the concept of price was important.</seg>
<seg id="102">For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts of auditors agreed on detailed specifications, for example: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="103">(The VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for the currency conversion. (29 CZK - 1 euro).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of different types (steel concrete, reinforced concrete, steel composite and steel) and different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.</seg>
<seg id="106">The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">The most common were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The study showed that the m2 price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the square meter price.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see illustrations below).</seg>
<seg id="111">On the A 17 two bridges could be identified, on the D 8 four bridges with a significantly increased price.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges were determined partly by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (based on the distance to the regression curve, atypically expensive bridges can be identified).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw final conclusions, the causes for the respective high price have to be determined in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">This could be due, for example, to uneconomic administrative action, but also to the requirements for the protection of the environment or other legitimate reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length indicated that the Czech concrete bridges are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">This was also supported by lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">During joint meetings, two reasons for this situation were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are predominantly awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="122">This also enables medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometers of motorway sections.</seg>
<seg id="124">Orders of this size cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge constructions built is greater than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the NKE noted that the construction of bridges will be determined long before construction begins,</seg>
<seg id="128">already at the time of the submission of the application for planning approval by the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this time, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, economic efficiency plays a subordinate role in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">Only through a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would a final conclusion have been possible with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have blown up the scope of this examination.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The significant price differences can be the result of an underdeveloped competition for tunnel constructions in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow general conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Economic efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden – Prague motorway</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The plan was to gradually expand the D8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">The section 0805 was to be built by the Bohemian Central Mountains in front of the border section 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic finances the D8 under the programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the program number 327 220 “Construction of the motorway D 8 Prague – "st" nad Labem – Czech German state border" two objectives are defined:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">as a national objective: to improve the link between Prague and the Oesti nad Labem;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.</seg>
<seg id="147">The programme provided for the completion of the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical with the time of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains, the NKE noted that the planning approval decision had already been issued.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental associations have brought an action against this decision.</seg>
<seg id="151">A final verdict is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="152">Compared to the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, a delay in the completion of section No.0805 could not be ruled out for several years.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of the construction phase No.0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD underwent an economic analysis of section no. 0807 of the D 8 near the border and section no.0805 of the Bohemian Central Mountains between 1999 and 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">As an investment cost, it invested around 639 million euros for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the Economic Performance Survey (EIRR)</seg>
<seg id="158">Variant opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 22 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25 000 cars per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic feasibility study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section close to the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains would go under traffic at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the examination it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains would not be opened at the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The costs of both sections as at 31.12.2005 amounted to 897 million euros without VAT, which is 27.4% higher than the cost-effectiveness assessment of 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">In addition, there is a risk that Section 0805 will get another more elaborate in-service course, which would affect the economic viability of the project.</seg>
<seg id="169">The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010 is economically justified.The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day in 2007. The project is then below the cost-effectiveness limit.</seg>
<seg id="171">Higher traffic volumes on the routes, which are intended to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Mountains, are highly likely to result in traffic jams and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original cost-effectiveness study.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the border section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomical.</seg>
<seg id="174">Cost increases also occurred in the construction of the A 17 as in the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the macroeconomic assessment for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for transport assumed investment costs of around 320 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="176">It thus determined a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, the costs have increased to around 670 million euros and the benefit/cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">In the years 2003 to 2005, the BRH examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A17 motorway, regardless of the parallel tests with the NK.</seg>
<seg id="179">He noted that the authority responsible for the permit required an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the superfluousness of the landscape tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="181">As a result, 10 million euros in construction costs and 150,000 euros in annual operating costs could be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="182">During the examination of the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was insufficiently prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">In the planning phase, the road construction administration refrained from recording the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschen wall, as it was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">Only when the tunnel propulsion reached the wall did it catch up.</seg>
<seg id="186">It turned out that the rock was more weathered than assumed in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">Extensive measures such as anchorages, injections and stone impact protection nets for around 3.3 million euros were necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional, already necessary services such as securing the Dölzschener wall, but also for those that would not have been necessary for a perfect construction preparation.</seg>
<seg id="189">These include expenses due to disturbed construction processes (3.2 million euros), additional training of the tunnelling team (0.5 million euros) and increased wages and material prices due to the construction time extension (7 million euros).</seg>
<seg id="190">There is no lasting added value compared to these additional expenditures of around 10.7 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="191">The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to better exercise its specialist supervision for major road construction measures.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, it should insist that road construction administrations introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of the cooperation for BRH and NK’ The cooperation met the expectations of both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both audit institutions developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.</seg>
<seg id="196">It was noted that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadways of the D 8 do not differ from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of both audit institutions involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience, which will be useful in future audits.</seg>

<seg id="2">Foreword</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the Court of Auditors has the power to audit all public finances.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration requires that the courts of auditors have the power to examine tax collection as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Organisation of European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for auditing public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national audit bodies can only carry out their audit activities in cooperation with the audit bodies of other states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As an example, the examination of internationally organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.</seg>
<seg id="11">Cooperation between the authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Audit institutions in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea for an audit of the sales tax as well as the system MIAS arose at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the course of thorough preparation, the participating audit institutions first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and the procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the examination subjects for the examination planning.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (particularly the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.</seg>

<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as the "EC") with the free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="26">(DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.</seg>
<seg id="28">VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006 jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NK") and the Bundesrech-nungshof ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="29">The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international mutual assistance between the financial administrations as well as the comparison of the VAT management systems in the two states.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI testing standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audit of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the "exchange of information" priority in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary notifications.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation regarding cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany the entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is the exceedance of the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purpose of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German taxpayer wishes to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="42">As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is free of VAT, but there is a right to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the transport service, insofar as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EC level to standardise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While taxable persons in the Czech Republic only have to file VAT returns for periods of under-year taxation (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly)</seg>
<seg id="49">VAT pre-registrations and after the end of the calendar year to submit a VAT annual declaration.</seg>
<seg id="50">In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxable persons in Germany have to submit VAT pre-registrations electronically.</seg>
<seg id="51">The introduction of the obligation to issue VAT declarations electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="52">4) Summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="53">While taxable persons in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary notifications to the tax authorities (FÄ), German taxable persons have to submit the summary notifications to the CLO2.</seg>
<seg id="54">Accordingly, the information from the summary notifications will be available to FÄ in the Czech Republic immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="55">The information from the summary notifications is only available to German FÄ after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="56">In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="57">The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the update of the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="58">This would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the specified period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German CLO constantly monitor the deadlines (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The NCC and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">Within the framework of the cooperation, the two audit bodies examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions that were realized between Czech and German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="69">Of these, 31 cases were examined jointly by using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The Court of Auditors found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the taxable persons had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or had not indicated the purchase of goods in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="76">A number of cases were uncovered in which taxable persons incorrectly reported sales in their summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the clerks (of the FÄ) had to determine in these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="79">Examination procedures in the CR</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II – "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">Verified bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadai, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Tinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">On 23 April 2007, the College of the National Committee approved the findings of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="83">Examination procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The examination was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase, the actual examination began in the 4th quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NK, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was conducted in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files from the following cases were included in the audit:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, München II, IV and München V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Mitte, Cologne-Porz, Cologne-Süd</seg>
<seg id="92">Discussions were also held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">The examination results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="95">In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both courts of auditors took place.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in the other country.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel examinations: 1.</seg>
<seg id="100">Registration of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach – legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the handling of requests for information by tax officials and the verification of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. Tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary messages.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. Risk management in the VAT area.</seg>
<seg id="110">At a meeting in December 2006 to vote on the further examination of the NAC and the BRH, both sides familiarised themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests already achieved.</seg>

<seg id="118">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000, will be liable to pay on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (Section 94 (1) of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter “Law No. 235/2004“.</seg>
<seg id="119">The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.</seg>
<seg id="120">Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxable person if he has exceeded the application deadline for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who provides services subject to VAT or exempt from VAT with the right to deduct input tax, must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other requirements specified in Law No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="122">An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law, may voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="123">The registration procedure under Law No. 337/1992 begins upon receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer.</seg>
<seg id="124">If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you must indicate in your application the deadline from which you apply for registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The financial officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts about the information given therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="127">If the financial officer has verified that the trader meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notification of registration and the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="128">In the communication, the tax officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for VAT and the assessment period for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">The investment period is the calendar quarter; unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="130">If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the investment period and must inform the tax officer of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.</seg>
<seg id="133">The taxpayer must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. Law No. 235/2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents)3.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax number contains the encoding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as a special law determines this. In the case of legal entities, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of Section 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite a request from the tax officer, the local tax officer must register him ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="137">A communication will also be issued, which will be sent to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, each trader admitted to a business activity receives a tax number for any type of tax when registering for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="139">This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">In accordance with Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, the tax officer may, in the event of non-compliance with the duty to register the value added tax, require the taxable person to pay up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover, which the person concerned unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date from which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person, until the date on which the registration as a taxable person took place by order of the tax officer (Section 98(1) of Law No.</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount fixed in this way shall be deemed to be a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98(3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VATable person can be deleted for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Deletion of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (Section 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).</seg>
<seg id="145">A taxable person may request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Deletion of registration ex officio (Section 106(7) of Law No. 235/2004), if: a) the taxable person has not rendered a service for a period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officer of the reasons for this, b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235/2004, c) the previous taxable person no longer meets the requirements for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Taxable persons without legal domicile, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and has no legal domicile, place of business or place of business in the Czech Republic or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235/2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes taxable with the provision of the service in question.</seg>
<seg id="148">He must file an application for registration with FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.</seg>
<seg id="149">He is obliged to indicate in this application all USt-IdNr. assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became liable for VAT on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic in accordance with Law No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the event of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require the entrepreneurs concerned to provide evidence (invoices or written explanations) for proof of performance.</seg>
<seg id="152">If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the performance-based contract documents.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 106(9) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is authorised to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax applications or declarations and to pay taxes.</seg>
<seg id="155">During the examination of the NK, it turned out that in the case of the filing of a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for the filing of a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, which are decisive for the possibility of deletion of the registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of taxable persons in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In accordance with the provisions of the tax regulations (section 137, 138 AO), each business operation must be registered with the municipality and/or the competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">This registration must be made no later than one month after commencement of business activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality forwards the application to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been commenced but has not been notified, it may also register the taxable person retroactively on its own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="162">In Germany, taxable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register for Zwekke the value added tax if they meet the requirements in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">Special FÄs are responsible for entrepreneurs based abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of 30 April 2004, the company had registered a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.</seg>
<seg id="168">According to the BRH, these FÄ with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called false self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten states to the EC, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These (ticket) self-employed persons do not meet the conditions for recognition as an entrepreneur specified in Section 2 UStG, since they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work execution.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire of the responsible FA and provide information about the company and the business activities carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a mandatory form for all FÄ in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the organizational units generally responsible for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="174">With the help of this form, a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer is carried out before the allocation of a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control number.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="179">The VAT ID no. is automatically assigned by the CLO if the taxpayer declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-registrations or in his VAT annual declaration.</seg>
<seg id="180">The USt-IdNr. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. Upon request (e.g. if he ceases to do business), but only after completion of all tax transactions (assessment of all financial years) or 2. if the financial administration determines that he no longer conducts business.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID no. depends on the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID no. can be terminated there at this time.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the Value Added Tax Act (Section 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxable persons do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 euros and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of 50,000 euros in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they do not have to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs are obliged to register with the tax office and file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small business owner may declare the non-application of Section 19 (1) UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration is binding for the following five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">He may then invoice the sales tax and deduct the input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (Section 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free transactions and waive the deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the invoices it must be stated that a fiscal representative has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the exceedance of the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, an entrepreneur who can be registered for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both the NK and the BRH noted that the German two-stage registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for both national registration for VAT and intra-Community transactions, can lead to considerable misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business activities with the municipality or with the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration enables a correct assessment of the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be harmonised.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.</seg>
<seg id="208">This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.</seg>
<seg id="209">This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person takes up a business activity, the responsible FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="211">In future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT ID no.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach</seg>
<seg id="214">The legal regulations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="216">The exemption from VAT also applies if the carriage is carried out by persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners who are taxable domestically.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return journey is considered a separate transport process.</seg>
<seg id="218">If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic carry out no other economic activity than the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic was exempted from VAT due to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic Annex No. V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The text of the above passage reads as follows:</seg>
<seg id="220">"For the purpose of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F of the Directive, maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28(4) of the Directive is met or until the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."</seg>
<seg id="221">The legal regulations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b(1) UStG, a transport service shall be carried out where the carriage is effected.</seg>
<seg id="223">Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxable person transports through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany shall be regarded as taxable transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.</seg>
<seg id="228">It registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus named in the taxable person's application.</seg>
<seg id="229">The entrepreneur must indicate his taxable transport services in a German VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport service is provided for a domestic entrepreneur, the non-resident taxable person does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="232">In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services must pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is known as the "shifting of tax liability" and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxable person and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means to check the correctness of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile control groups of customs check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each check, the mobile control groups transmit an inspection protocol to the responsible FA.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident taxable person can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an examination to be carried out in the FA, or may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may request mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters for checking the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too costly in relation to the low volume of VAT on taxable passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxable person causes disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of the foreign accounting principles.</seg>
<seg id="243">Accordingly, such an examination is expected to involve a higher amount of time than that of a resident taxable person, although the examination is limited to the passenger transport operations taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-resident taxable person must not only accept the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, for each Member State in which a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxpayer must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="246">Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation is different in the two states.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States as well as between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act on the Accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route falling within German territory.</seg>
<seg id="251">If a non-resident taxable person provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="252">This registers the taxable person who must declare the taxable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three out of four Czech taxable persons registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.</seg>
<seg id="255">The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States – which levy VAT under Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system – have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of investing in VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state in which the carriage begins or in which the service provider is located.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Delivery and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">Unless otherwise specified by law, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period, even if no tax liability has arisen.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax liability arises at the end of the period for filing the VAT return. According to Law No. 235/2004, VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation. Here the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If, as a result, an above-average amount of deductible input tax results in a refund claim, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of this deduction without the need for an application.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="266">Pursuant to Section 73 (11) of Law No. 235/2004, the claim for deduction of input tax may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the claim for deduction of input tax arose.</seg>
<seg id="267">After expiry of this period, the deduction of input tax may still be claimed within three years after the end of the tax period in which the assertion would have been possible for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">An amendment to Law No. 235/2004 which entered into force on 1 January 2005 permits the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the claim for deduction of input tax could have been asserted for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">A taxable person must file a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability; (b) he makes corrections which do not alter the last known tax liability, but only change previous information; (c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with Section 49 of Law No. 235/2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">A taxable person can file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.</seg>
<seg id="273">The VAT declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.</seg>
<seg id="274">The delivery via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.</seg>
<seg id="275">If it is carried out without an electronic signature, it must additionally be submitted to data carriers.</seg>
<seg id="276">The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.</seg>
<seg id="277">The value of related services must be specified in separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some categories are used for automated primary controls within the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of the goods delivered to persons registered as taxable in other EC Member States is compared with the data provided by the Czech taxable persons in their summary notifications.</seg>
<seg id="280">The value of purchases of goods from other Member States by persons registered as taxable is compared with the information in the summary notifications of taxable persons from other EC Member States with the help of MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="281">Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check of the VAT declarations.</seg>
<seg id="282">This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility check includes a calculation of the benchmarks for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 37(1) of Law No. 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this Act.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system – Automated tax information system used by Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="286">In its examination, the NKO found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person in question if the VAT return was not filed.</seg>
<seg id="287">Delivery and processing of VAT declarations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxable persons who are obliged to submit VAT pre-registrations must nevertheless file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="291">Taxable persons are generally obliged to file a VAT pre-registration until the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is generated (Section 18 (2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability in the previous year exceeds 6,136 euros or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations at the latest by the 10th day after the end of the respective month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxable person can also opt for the submission of monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has received a refund of 6,136 euros in the previous year (Section 18 (2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">If the annual value added tax is not more than 512 euros, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT declarations must be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="295">A resulting VAT liability must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="296">A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="297">(Legal) There are no deadlines for processing VAT returns and for refunding VAT overpayments.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.</seg>
<seg id="299">In principle, VAT declarations, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (duty or payment) deadlines (Section 18 (6) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">The extension of the time limit must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment must be made.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment is offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period of December.</seg>
<seg id="304">If an error is detected, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT pre-registration.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no "complementary" VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">If the VAT declaration to be filed by 31 May of the following year is once submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT pre-registration, but only the incorrect annual VAT declaration.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Taxable persons must submit the VAT pre-registrations electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The FÄ may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual VAT return can be submitted in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If the tax is paid without certification, the taxable person must make the declaration additionally on paper and with his personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">If no VAT pre-registrations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxable person6.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of a late levy, the taxpayer may be charged a late fee (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of 25,000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="315">In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FÄ often did not charge this delay surcharge.</seg>
<seg id="316">In cases where the FÄ levied the late surcharges, the amount was fixed inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, especially in the submission of the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The form of the VAT declaration contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are also separate lines for the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable sales are to be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="321">The VAT declarations submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="323">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="324">After all data is collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a false selection is made on the basis of certain standards.</seg>
<seg id="325">The VAT declarations selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically generated test instructions (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxable persons must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the taxable person's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, taxable persons must file their pre-registrations at the latest 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annual VAT declaration must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to file an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by submitting a single VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">– If the taxpayer amends his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;</seg>
<seg id="335">– The federal states do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxable persons until the annual VAT declarations have usually been processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This duty enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the sales ceiling for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the responsible FA can compare the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxable persons are obliged to submit the VAT pre-registration electronically.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to file a tax return electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary notifications</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235/2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit corresponding summary notifications (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").</seg>
<seg id="345">The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to USt-IdNr7, the individual taxable person under whom they are registered in the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="346">Information on services is not provided in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="347">Taxable persons with a calendar-monthly or quarterly tax period must hand over the ZM to the local FA at the latest on the 25th day after the end of each quarter.</seg>
<seg id="348">Inaccurate data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days after the error has been detected.</seg>
<seg id="349">Incorrect data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similar to tax returns, taxable persons can also submit the ZM electronically.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a taxable person does not surrender a ZM or correction ZM, even though he is obliged to do so under Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer must ask him to surrender the relevant ZM and refer him to the consequences of the non-delivery. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the tax officer is authorised to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No. 337/1992.</seg>
<seg id="352">In its examination, the NKO found that the FÄ mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations when submitting the ZM, as the omission of a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">Pursuant to Section 102(5) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Amending ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In case of disagreement</seg>
<seg id="356">8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxpayer corrects false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.</seg>
<seg id="357">The financial officer must correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">– the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or Amending ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting an Amending ZM;</seg>
<seg id="359">– the financial officer has proven the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or Amending ZM.</seg>
<seg id="360">Corrections entered by the tax officer without a correction ZM from the taxpayer's side do not replace the taxable person's obligation to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that these are up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from the ZM will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may transmit and receive this data.</seg>
<seg id="363">This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The "O_MCTL" message is automatically sent to the CLO from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect USt ID no. specified in the transmitted ZM lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the incorrect USt-IdNr. is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the wrong USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="366">The list contains a "Notice of Doubts Regarding USt-IdNr.".</seg>
<seg id="367">The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxpayer must indicate this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return specified for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods specified by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM are forwarded by the CLO to the responsible FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="370">The clerks there must investigate the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="371">There can then be three different situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant categories of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by the suppliers from other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The difference is zero.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxable person in the meantime submits a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.</seg>
<seg id="377">(c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return, is higher than the value of their deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here again, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.</seg>
<seg id="379">After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer enters the results of his review in ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">These results are forwarded to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of transactions sent by the CLO for review can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 from Graph No. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="382">Figure 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">The significant reduction in the number in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a false selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">Deviations between the information in the VAT declarations and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error of the domestic purchaser.</seg>
<seg id="385">There may also be an error on the part of the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries are indicated differently in the ZM in the individual EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited FÄ are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of the summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly ZMs in which intra-Community deliveries are listed by purchaser (Section 18a (1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="390">If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of VAT pre-registrations, this also applies to the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="391">The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">The electronic levy has been mandatory since 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="393">The responsible FA may allow exemptions for individual taxable persons in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">If the taxable person determines that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a correction ZM within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In case of non-delivery of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="396">This includes the following steps: – first reminder – second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty will be imposed and – fixing the penalty.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows the fixing of a penalty payment of up to 25,000 euros (section 329 AO), the CLO sets fines of 125, 250 and 500 euros in three stages.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, Section 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxable person acts improperly if he intentionally or recklessly does not deliver a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.</seg>
<seg id="399">This infringement can be punished with a fine of up to 5,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ into the MIAS, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="401">The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="402">The information from the summary messages is only available to the FÄ after their processing by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The data of the ZM must be stored within three months after the respective calendar quarter (in MIAS).</seg>
<seg id="405">In the case of incorrect USt-IdNr. in the ZM of German taxable persons, the German CLO receives a notification "O_MCTL" from the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to him to request the right information.</seg>
<seg id="409">In the course of its examination, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the USt-IdNr. at the request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, remembering and threatening and fixing up to three consecutive fines takes too much time when a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">The cases, which were finally reported to the competent FÄ, were usually completed within one to two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The relevant FA refused tax exemption for reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.</seg>
<seg id="413">If the taxpayer provided the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the surrender of the corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="415">Therefore, the taxable persons often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO has no access to the data of the VAT declarations, there is no comparison of the information given in the VAT pre-registrations or the VAT declaration about goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This comparison can only be made by the FÄ. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Inaccurate VAT IDs are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data will be used for the control of employment taxation in the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="420">As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications are created and transmitted to the competent FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="422">This is done continuously, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all VAT-payers is created later and forwarded to the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="423">The risk management system (RMS) for the investment procedure then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">The system fully (only) checks those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must submit a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="427">The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the taxable persons in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same taxable persons in their VAT declarations.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison will be taken into account in the context of the tax determination.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.</seg>
<seg id="431">Since 1 January 2007, taxable persons must submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="432">The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after their processing at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the taxable persons in the ZM only indicate the deliveries of goods.</seg>
<seg id="434">The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct erroneous information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.</seg>
<seg id="435">Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect USt-IdNr. were not corrected even if the taxable person communicated the correct USt-IdNr. to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries, which German taxable persons make in their VAT pre-registrations, with the information of the corresponding ZM.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of the pre-registration and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="439">The data transmitted by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech taxable persons will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods indicated by Czech taxable persons in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The Czech CLO performs the comparison separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FÄ for examination.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such general control is only carried out for taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons only if the RMS has drawn up an inspection notice or if the taxable person has already been selected for an audit.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the FÄ from clarifying the reasons for the differences that arise.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current ZM system, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to surrender monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly levy would only increase the bureaucratic burden insignificantly, since most taxable persons in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to submit monthly VAT declarations or pre-registrations and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT declarations or pre-registrations.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be linked to the submission of VAT declarations or pre-registrations.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, an obligation to submit ZM monthly would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community acquisitions and would increase the data flows between the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.</seg>
<seg id="454">The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In order for the obligation to submit ZM monthly to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on goods deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT IDs in the O_MCTL notifications exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter audited.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data can be found in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">They have significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its numbers to the calendar quarter in which O_MCTL message was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information at level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxable persons who have carried them out.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request is carried out by a request for information (RFI) using the standardized SCAC print.</seg>
<seg id="470">The financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFIs or their responses to a received RFI to the CLO through the Finance Directorate. This concerns the translation into the foreign language of the information provided in the standardised SCAC print and the forwarding to the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It provides for their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FÄ for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period have been audited by the NCF.</seg>
<seg id="474">Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NK’s examination. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to requests made by Germany can be found in Figure 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">From the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases no reply had yet been received from Germany (in the remaining one case it could not be determined on the basis of the stated information when Germany answered the request for information).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Figure 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of the values of intra-Community sales stated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values of over 60,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Financial officials from other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.</seg>
<seg id="484">"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="485">"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="487">The financial officer obtains this information from the pre-printed notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law No. 235/2004 as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data in the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Finance Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. These data will then be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Czech Republic also provides information to other Member States on transactions in mail order which are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions which appear inadmissible and on potential "missing traders".</seg>
<seg id="490">This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC print in the spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the locally responsible FA.</seg>
<seg id="493">The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCACVordrucke to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the used SCACVordruck is single-language.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were submitted in order to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State or to demonstrate the tax exemption of intra-Community deliveries from Germany to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it examines whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of 15,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO provides for the translation of the freely formulated texts in SCAC print (B1-17) or (E) if they are not written in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">In order to answer the request for information, the CLO directs this to the responsible FA and refers to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor the maintenance of the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ of the answer to the unfinished requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The FÄ receive the required information by letter from the taxable person or by carrying out an external audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.</seg>
<seg id="504">With this short and flexible form of examination, an announcement to the taxpayer is not necessary and it has proven itself in the investigation of a single turnover.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany will provide the other Member State with the following information: – via VAT ID number, which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States – on the refund of input tax to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC Member States with the following information in the context of the structured automatic exchange of information:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. Delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., b. Distance sales (shipping) to other EC Member States that are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the acquisitions reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods that have been incorrectly subject to taxation by the taxable person in Germany, e. potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their U.S. ID</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the locally responsible FÄ, which transmit the corresponding SCACVordrucke to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACVordprints (Czech-English) and translates information into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instructions to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a single-language form only in German.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKO found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were dealt with by the German financial administration only in 40.6% of the cases within this period.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.</seg>
<seg id="514">Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of answered requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="515">That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has changed in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the information available to us, the German CLO now reminds the tax offices to answer the pending requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of Value Added Tax or its Department of Risk Management deals with the identification of potential risk fields for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.</seg>
<seg id="523">At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares risk management in the area of VAT conceptually and cooperates in this area with the competent EC institutions and the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the MIAS system, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.</seg>

<seg id="529">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="530">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="531">The Department of Methodology of Tax Examination and Tax Investigation leads, among other things, To carry out risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, to establish priorities for the work plan of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of the cases to be examined, to prepare risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, to collect information from the financial administration as well as other sources and to make proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Tax investigation offices exist at the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for taxable persons and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxable persons (e.g. in the Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of links in chain fraud cases and the information of local financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected FÄs.</seg>
<seg id="534">These have regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local area of competence of the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain transactions.</seg>
<seg id="536">These special units check according to the needs of the tax investigators or focus on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and taxable persons with particularly high turnovers.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: – the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk-prone nature of tax returns; – the task of "selection of taxable persons to be audited", whereby the taxable persons to be audited are selected on the basis of certain criteria; – the task of "IAS", which allows financial officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The "MIAS" task allows, inter alia: – verification of the validity of the VAT ID no. of taxable persons from other Member States, – confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as stated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxable person concerned from other Member States, – preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not submitted ZM, – formal control of the information that taxable persons in the Czech Republic have provided in their ZM before this information is transmitted to other Member States, – compilation of a</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their duties to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from government agencies such as the Commercial Register, Land Registry, Motor Vehicle Register, Trade Register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of the summary notifications in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a fully uniform database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the CLO, the ST I 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" – Coordination Office for Special Sales Tax Examinations and Tax Investigations) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.</seg>
<seg id="545">In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered Missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="546">The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experiences of KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.</seg>
<seg id="549">The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. of other Member States appearing in the ZM of German taxpayers will be carried out at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal review takes place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The validity of the USt-IdNr. referred to in the ZM is checked on the basis of the O_MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid USt-IdNr., see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on the MIAS data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of communications to detect suspected missing traders. As clues, certain features are used, which usually occur in carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="553">The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.</seg>
<seg id="554">The audit by the BRH confirmed that all available features must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability on a case of tax fraud (instead of focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).</seg>
<seg id="555">Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the messages.</seg>
<seg id="556">The risk management system should also take into account other indications, e.g. the taxable person's payment behaviour, the industry or the company's shareholding relationships.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the system creates a list of taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-registration or annual declaration.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions indicated by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="561">The financial administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as these would result in too many inconsistencies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="562">– Supplier and acquirer assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community sales;</seg>
<seg id="563">– different accounting and tax declaration of Skonti and discounts.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing the information from the VAT declarations with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in the VAT declarations and certain other indications (e.g. Company word, age of the owner/participant, number of employees and method of payment of the taxpayer).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out.</seg>
<seg id="566">This system is used in the processing of sales tax pre-registrations by the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="567">As a result, the responsible FA receives the information of the RMS before the value added tax is set.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of uncovered cases of evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The system compiles a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests it proposes.</seg>
<seg id="574">In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro fuzzy system (also called data mining system) calculates how likely it is that a taxable person is involved in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then compiles a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">On the basis of this list, the FÄ selects the taxable persons concerned for examination and reports the test results to the data center in question.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems expedient.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will occur during actual use.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKE and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Like the different approaches in the three above-mentioned German federal states, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – has proved to be not a national but a European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.</seg>
<seg id="587">A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. Failure to do so will result in fraudsters selecting the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="589">The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State where the initiator is based.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected results from the examination of individual sales In the context of the parallel tests, the NK and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and/or deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="593">Acquisitions which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two courts of auditors jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, the implementation of which was in doubt, or which the taxable persons of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, the National Chamber of Commerce examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, on the basis of communications from the BRH, the NKE examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxable persons had indicated in their tax returns and ZM in 43 cases.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the NK, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="598">The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 60,500 euros from a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech taxable person declared an acquisition of only 29,869 euros, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to check the value of the delivered goods.</seg>
<seg id="603">The German side stated in its reply to the Czech request for information that the German taxable person in question had delivered goods to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004 to the value of 27,381 euros, in the third quarter goods to the value of 31,997 euros and in the fourth quarter to the value of 10,276 euros.</seg>
<seg id="604">Furthermore, it emerged from the answer that the VAT ID number of the German taxable person was not valid until September 28, 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application by the German taxable person and had brought forward the validity of the USt-IdNr. retroactively as of May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this information, it was a (internal) purchase of goods by the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="607">In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKA found that in 2004 the Czech taxable person had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of the purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from the purchases from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the responsible clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was also included in the declared acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="609">In response to a request for information from the National Chamber of Commerce, the BRH stated that the German supplier had been registered in September 2003 as subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="610">At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number that ultimately applied to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is usually not possible in Germany to assign a VAT ID number retroactively to a taxable person, this was done in 2006 by the responsible clerk of the German tax administration retroactively as of 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO assigns a USt-IdNr. retroactively if the German entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO caused the delay after the taxable person's request for the issuance of a USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO grants the USt-IdNr. retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not need a valid USt-IdNr. for an intra-Community delivery according to Section 6 UStG.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of his supplier to declare the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO retroactively issued the USt-IdNr. in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.</seg>
<seg id="618">From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">The German authorities stated in their reply that the German taxable person had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organizational reasons it was not until 16 February 2005 that a USt-IdNr. was assigned in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="620">In response to a request from the local Czech tax official, the NKO learned that the tax officer had carried out a VAT audit with the Czech taxable person for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxable person had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 which he had rendered to the German taxable person before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">The (Czech) tax office imposed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 on the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="623">On the basis of a request from the National Chamber of Commerce, the BRH found that the German taxable person had only been assigned the VAT ID number when he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the submission of the VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this VAT return, the taxable person stated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic to the value of 160 euros (approx. CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In his VAT return for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="627">When checking the registration of the German taxable person in the system MIAS, the Czech tax officer stated that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the delivery of goods to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech taxable person issued a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries to the value of CZK 114,615 and VAT to the amount of CZK 21,777, which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">By making a request to the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person subsequently filed an application for the resumption of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxable person had been registered since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Accordingly, the Czech tax officer checked the validity of the registration of the German taxable person in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">From the German information it emerged that the German taxable person had only been assigned a VAT ID no. on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">As a result, the Czech tax officer rejected the request to resume the tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place because the German taxable person had only received a VAT ID no. on 11 November 2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient explained both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the value added tax on it and also demanded the reimbursement of input taxes in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German tax officer did not correct the information in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German taxable person mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German taxable person also confused the Czech tax official.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax officer reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxable person from a German taxable person valued at 22,686 euros.</seg>
<seg id="640">In a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that the Czech tax officer had examined in an external audit with the Czech taxable person whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxable person had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech taxable person did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number for transactions within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech tax officer also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxable person so that he could, if necessary, initiate a corresponding tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech FA regarded this business as the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set any sales tax for the purchase of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH found that under German law a taxable person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only have the UStIdNr. of the purchaser in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">In this case, the turnover according to German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community delivery, which should be subject to income tax in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this business incident, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount limit of 15,000 euros: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 12,561 euros from a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech financial officer carried out an audit for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">Within the framework of intergovernmental mutual assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery of goods by means of a SCAC print.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech taxable person stated that he had not received the goods, had never been in a business relationship with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been booked with him.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax administration rejected the request for the transfer of documents – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – because the turnover was less than 15,000 euros and no other justification had been given.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax officer did not receive any documents for a subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit remained inconclusive and the original tax determination remained in place.</seg>
<seg id="656">On the basis of a request from the NK, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative17" (section 22 (a) – (e) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German taxable person explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to tax exemption was recognised.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">Section 4.6.1 showed that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than the answers of the Czech financial administration:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. During its audit, the NKO found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of wa-ren deliveries made to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person to the value of 86,307 euros; however, the Czech taxable person declared for the same period in his VAT return only the purchase of goods to the value of 35,314 euros.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side indicated that the request for information could not be processed since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, a Czech tax official asked for a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 to the value of 1,265,554 euros by means of a SCAC print, with indications of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">At the time of its examination, the NKO found that a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.</seg>
<seg id="667">In a request to the local tax officer, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German taxable person to the value of 11,816.103 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax officer corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxable person gave a corrected ZM.</seg>
<seg id="669">Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out at the German acquirer in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all vehicles concerned had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were sold to other taxable persons in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to the MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech taxable person purchased a car worth 48,500 euros from a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="672">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="673">In response to a request from the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the National Chamber of Commerce found that the Czech taxable person had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Czech taxable person did not file any tax returns even after being requested by the tax officer. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the aforementioned delivery from the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech taxable person did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the reply to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the completion of the examination of the NCD how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="678">Due to non-fulfilment of the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial response was sent because at the time of the NK- and BRH examination, the relevant FA had not yet completed the external audit:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004 to the value of 16,991 euros by means of a SCAC print, with indications of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In his reply to the request for information, the German tax officer stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech taxable person for deliveries worth 16,335 euros.</seg>
<seg id="683">On the basis of the request of the NK, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the acquirer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth 16,335 euros twice in his VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, a Czech tax official asked for a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005 to the value of 198,167 euros by means of a SCAC print, with signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles, and that, moreover, the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">It found that the local FA had carried out several external audits with the Czech taxable person in order to check the deduction of above-average input taxes.</seg>
<seg id="688">However, an unauthorised claim was not established.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that the German taxable person had declared in his VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of 579,114 euros for the period in question, and that the examination of the German FA by the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.</seg>
<seg id="691">In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic inconsistencies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005 the Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 35,716 euros from the German taxable person; however, the Czech taxable person did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech taxable person did not cooperate with the tax officer and did not do business at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech tax officer asked for a review of how the German taxable person had communicated with the Czech in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="695">The German reply to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the address indicated and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder.</seg>
<seg id="696">The total value of the order was 155,000 euros, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth 21,659 euros.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech taxable person sent the German taxable person a false confirmation of payment for the amount of 155,153 euros in favour of the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="698">After uncovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the delivered material, with the exception of a part valued at 7,916 euros.</seg>
<seg id="699">In a request to the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that the financial administration, on the basis of the information received from the Czech taxable person, carried out, inter alia, retrospectively the sales taxation of goods deliveries from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.</seg>
<seg id="700">On the basis of a request from the National Chamber of Commerce, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person in the value of 7,916 euros.</seg>
<seg id="701">In accordance with German legislation, the German taxable person declared the reversal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.</seg>
<seg id="702">His ZM contained the following information concerning Czech taxpayers:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the verification of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCACVordruck.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had delivered goods to the German taxpayer with a total value of 396,126 euros and provided services with a value of 11,885 euros.</seg>
<seg id="706">It found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit with the Czech taxable person in order to examine this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech taxable person had supplied and installed a production plant for the German.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech taxable person supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German taxable person did not remove the assembled production plant and claimed defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person charged the German production plant for 107.100 euros and 11,885 euros for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German taxpayer received the bills, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">By enquiry with the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that all invoices in the books of the Czech taxable person had been properly booked.</seg>
<seg id="713">The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH found that the locally responsible FA came to the conclusion, based on the reply of the Czech tax administration, that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxable person to the German including the assembly performed.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German service recipient of the factory delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">Since the VAT liability of the German taxable person remained unchanged, the German FA did not cause any correction of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxable person A purchased a machine worth 58,000 euros from the German taxable person C in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech financial officer sent a request to Germany to verify this information.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German taxable person C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxable person B in 2004, but had returned it to the German taxable person C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German taxable person C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German taxable person C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxable person A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">He received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxable person's office in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">By enquiry with the local tax officer responsible for the taxable person B, the NKA found that according to the MIAS data, the German taxable person C had delivered goods (another machine) to the Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004 to the value of 88,027 euros.</seg>
<seg id="727">Taxable person B stated that he had not received this product, so that the local Czech tax officer sent a request for information to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">The answer was that the machine had been delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">In the course of further investigations with the taxable person B, the tax officer stated that the machine had not been booked with the taxable person B to the value of 88,027 ’ and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German taxable person C had delivered to the Czech taxable person A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">It also found that the Czech tax officer responsible for the taxable person A had carried out an audit of the taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax officer had the invoice of the German taxable person C of 7 February 2005, in which the taxable person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax official stated that the taxable person A had not booked this invoice.</seg>
<seg id="733">Taxable person A had concluded a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also took care of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxable person A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH found that the German taxable person C had delivered the machine to another German taxable person D, not to the Czech Republic, to the value of 88,027 euros.</seg>
<seg id="737">Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">Consequently, the German tax officer did not recognize the claim of the German tax-compulsory C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in its tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German taxable person D delivered the machine to the Czech taxable person B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">The BRH also noted that the German taxable person C had indicated in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth 58,000 ’ to the Czech taxable person A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="743">The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">During the examination of requests for information received, the National Chamber of Commerce found that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German taxable person to a Czech taxable person to the value of 879,680,625 euros.</seg>
<seg id="746">The German financial officer stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The German taxable person had not exercised any active business activity since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The National Court found that the Czech tax officer had carried out an external audit with the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="749">The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim of the German taxable person against the German tax administration, which the Czech taxable person had asserted as a shareholder in the German company at the German FA.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information given to the NK, the Czech tax officer does not yet have any information that the German tax administration is handling the case with respect to the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="751">From the available information it follows that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxable person in the MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for these inconsistencies was the omitted indication of the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see above). Section 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to the MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person delivered goods to a Czech taxable person with a total value of 33,205 euros.</seg>
<seg id="754">However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="755">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial officer requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="756">In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxable person, and that the other goods had been collected personally.</seg>
<seg id="757">By enquiry with the locally competent Czech Fi-nanzbeam, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person had filed a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="758">Nevertheless, the differences regarding the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so that the Czech tax officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="759">This test has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a German taxable person had delivered goods to a Czech taxable person worth 46,854 euros.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, a Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only 14,856 euros.</seg>
<seg id="762">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="763">With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31,999 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxable person and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="764">By enquiring with the local Czech tax official, the NKx stated that after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech taxable person and stayed with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">So far, no supplementary VAT return has been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech financial officer informed the NK ’ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT determination for the relevant tax period would be met.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods to the German taxpayer to the value of 11,600 euros.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax officer asked for verification whether the aforementioned Czech taxable persons actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxable person had founded a number of sham companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">In the course of the review of the transaction by the FA, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech taxable person, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech taxpayer presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech taxable person was not registered in Germany as subject to VAT and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax officer sent this information to the German tax administration in his reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="775">In a request to the locally competent Czech tax official, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German taxable person and at the same time asserted the right of deduction of input tax for the acquisition from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">In his Czech VAT return, he did not register any VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="777">Due to a supplementary VAT return, which had been issued after the external audit, the Czech tax officer fixed the VAT liability unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to Czech legislation, in this case there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">Thus, the Czech financial officer drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH noted that the German tax officer immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, from which it emerged that the goods had not left Germany, corrected the tax return of the German taxable person and demanded the payment of VAT to the value of 1,600 euros.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the responsible FA sent a control notification to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community deliveries which may not have been carried out:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax officer received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question whether the Czech taxable person had purchased a car worth 47,400 euros from the German taxable person in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The request for information was accompanied as an attachment by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="786">As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="787">In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax officer found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had no contact with a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="789">With this information, the Czech financial officer answered the request for information and at the same time declared that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.</seg>
<seg id="790">By enquiry with the local Czech tax official, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is unavailable.</seg>
<seg id="791">After a tax complaint procedure for the tax period February 2005, the Czech tax officer set the tax liability of the Czech taxable person at zero.</seg>
<seg id="792">In the course of a further investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an Internet advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="793">The BRH found that the local German tax officer had rejected the claim of the German taxable person to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was not able to clarify a difference of 3,000 euros between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="795">In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxable person should have delivered goods worth 89,424 euros to a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German taxable person did not comply with the MIAS data, the German financial officer requested the verification of deliveries and their payment within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In his reply to the request for information, the Czech financial officer stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech taxable person issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorized person, namely this shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax officer that the owner of the capital had deposited the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash receipts were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">In a request to the local Czech FA, the NKO found that the tax officer had recognised the Czech taxable person's right to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States to the value of CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the German tax officer did not correct the VAT return of the German purchaser, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the previous external audit did not show any signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to the MIAS data, in 2005 a German taxable person purchased goods from the Czech Republic to the value of 4,251,196 euros, according to which he had purchased goods to the value of 43,274 euros in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">The German taxable person declared the intra-Community acquisitions neither in his VAT declaration 2004 nor in the one for the year 2005.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, he did not declare any value-appropriate initial sales.</seg>
<seg id="808">Because of these inconsistencies, the German FA filed a request for information regarding the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery notified by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company had no managing director (or other legal representative).</seg>
<seg id="812">It can be seen from the documents handed over to the NKE by the responsible tax officer that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxable person, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the start of the sales tax audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the taxable person was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.</seg>
<seg id="815">The Czech taxpayer has not issued any VAT returns since April 2006.</seg>
<seg id="816">In the context of the parallel examination, the NKE, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two audit bodies exchanged information on the audited cases via the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the responsible FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do taxable business in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Based on this information, the company was registered from June 2005, but did not receive a German USt-IdNr.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria in the name, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to insufficient own production capacities, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German taxable person (UDE) based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of the wind turbines:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:</seg>
<seg id="824">– The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines in its name, at its risk and for its own account for assembly to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in his own name, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in one EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the country of residence of the Czech company19.</seg>
<seg id="828">Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction of input tax in its VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.</seg>
<seg id="830">However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">– The supply of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">– The delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) delivered both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The NKO found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although in this case there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the NKE and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT declarations and the MIAS data caused by the different legal provisions of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The cases examined also show that it takes some time for taxable persons and the FÄ to apply the new legal provisions:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods with a total value of 792,977,452 CZK to a German taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech taxable person reported intra-Community deliveries to another German taxable person in his ZM with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.</seg>
<seg id="842">From the information transmitted by the BRH to the NK, it emerged that in both cases they were electricity deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech taxable persons took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">In a further examination of these business transactions, an audit group of the NKA found that in 2004 different legal regulations on the supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic the taxable persons declared the deliveries of electrical energy in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 valid in 2004 as intra-Community deliveries of goods, according to the German legal provisions applicable in 2004 it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No. 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. When examining intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxable person in his ZM declared intra-Community deliveries to a German taxable person for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 with a total value of CZK 240.411.163 and another Czech taxable person in his ZM for the same period intra-Community deliveries to another German taxable person with a value of CZK 263.470.776.</seg>
<seg id="848">Information transmitted by the BRH to the NKE revealed that in both cases it had been supplies of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 in force from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place of performance where the purchaser has his legal domicile, place of business or place of business for which this delivery is made.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, the Czech taxable persons should not have indicated the electricity deliveries in their ZM for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community deliveries led to a difference in the amount of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKE.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both audit institutions gained in-depth knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the statutory provisions governing VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.</seg>
<seg id="857">For some of them, a further observation is worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit results, both auditors drew up recommendations for the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a review should be part of the follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two audit institutions form the basis for the successful execution of future audits in the field of VAT management.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement of works and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The awarding of services by public authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The task of the state is to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (threshold values).</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, EU member states have to transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The awarding of services is also an area at risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="12">Due to the generally high damage potential, the contracting authorities must therefore implement appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue benefits when awarding their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits both for the EU-wide award of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="14">The main focus of the audits was the application of the EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in construction and road construction or transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">Procurement below the EU thresholds has also been taken into account with a view to preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit results of both audit bodies are summarised in this Joint Report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="18">Testing areas and verified bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests, which he carried out in 2011/2012 with the building authorities, which are responsible for the road construction and the building construction of the federal government in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction work in road construction, railway construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is carried out predominantly by the building authorities of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In building construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budgets.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, freelancers are also involved in sub-areas of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="26">When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and in the market structure for construction services of both countries must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="27">Development of public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions based on it.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, for both EU-wide and national awards, many supplementary individual rules are prescribed by internal administrative provisions;</seg>
<seg id="31">such as the federal government’s so-called “procurement manuals“, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in compliance with public procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, the award procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and other statutory provisions that apply both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">Procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new regulation increased transparency in the use of public funds, increased competition and limited the possibilities for corruption in the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Principles of public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure apply in particular to EU-wide contracts.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are to be applied to the national award types (public tendering, restricted tendering, free-handed procurement), which, however, largely correspond to the above-mentioned EU-wide award types.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (in the case of contracts to be carried out throughout the EU) and the public tender (in the case of national contracts).</seg>
<seg id="39">In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested company can submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">The main purpose of this is to divide an overall construction measure into technical and partial cans.</seg>
<seg id="42">The individual awarding of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Czech public procurement law, in accordance with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including some 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Construction volume of public clients and shares of award types in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of this amount, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The construction volume of the federal government in building construction and highway construction (excluding railway construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="54">The volume of contracts for construction work in the federal building and highway construction sector was distributed among the award types in 2011 as follows: 80.7 % open procedures and public tenders, 12.7 % non-open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6 % negotiation procedures and hands-free contracts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public works in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, which corresponded to 37% of the total construction volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Breakdown by award type for 2011: 65.1% open procedure 14.3% non-public procedure 9.5% negotiation procedure 8.4% simplified procedure for contract volume below the threshold 2.7% other procedure</seg>
<seg id="59">The data relate to all public contracts for deliveries, services and construction services awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The o.a. Data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant part of public procurement, which is of great financial importance for all contracts to be taken into account in the prevention of corruption, and that the open procedure and the public tender are of outstanding importance in the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the results of the parallel tests</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel tests in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and on corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="63">In this context, the working groups of both audit institutions compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">In doing so, they found essentially:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (No. 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the EU requirements, the prevention of corruption is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which partly differ in their focal points and their detailing (No. 3.2).</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, an essential requirement for the award documents is that they must contain all the information required for the proper preparation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The service descriptions must be neutral and must not have any competition-restrictive requirements.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Germany, the award documents have largely met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the object of the order sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, construction services must be divided into lots if possible in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">In its tests, in particular in the field of road construction, the NKO found that the awarding of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Restrictions on market potential can lead to significant cost increases and entail the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">Pursuant to the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree on additional or amended services with the companies already contracted, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective specifications for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide contracts or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts, applies.</seg>
<seg id="79">This allows more companies to make offers.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economic results.</seg>
<seg id="81">For the construction projects, whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct estimation of the expected order value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, cost databases are used for the cost assessment of public buildings, especially in building construction,</seg>
<seg id="84">which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">In the case of construction work to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to adapt to the planned contracts at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the audited building authorities complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or missing controls may have impaired competition (No. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly prone to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries should switch as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.</seg>
<seg id="93">In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of applicants were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in tendering receive the same information during the offer phase in the interest of equal competition.</seg>
<seg id="97">A contact between these companies among themselves and with freelancers who were involved in the creation of the service description is to be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anticompetitive agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the audited building authorities in Germany partially did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">When opening up the offers in both countries, particular attention must be paid to the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="101">The requirements for labelling, documentation, custody and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly well defined in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tests in both countries revealed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by specifications for the structure and process organization.</seg>
<seg id="104">The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting authorities handed over offers for examination to third parties without first reviewing the offers and sufficiently documenting any abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="106">The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (No. 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition are to be informed of the intended award before the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection option also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="109">The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to meet the specified deadlines for the award of contracts or deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited building authorities in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.</seg>
<seg id="113">Also, some of the detected defects diminished the anti-corruption function of the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="116">EU public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the principle of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">To achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for construction works to be awarded across the EU for construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="120">For this purpose, their expected order amounts must reach or exceed a volume of currently 5,000,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="121">The rules relate in particular to the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of applicants and the Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of applicants and bidders.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of possible violations of public procurement law, the companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">Importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is understood as the abuse of a position of trust for the private benefit,</seg>
<seg id="128">which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">In doing so, they must review the organisation and organisation of their administrations in areas that are particularly at risk of corruption in order to implement appropriate safeguards against corruption.</seg>
<seg id="135">Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption – in particular bribery and bribery as well as acceptance and approval of benefits – is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="139">In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a guideline and recommendations on corruption12 prevention in the Federal Administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles must be observed for the award area: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eye principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and settlement, precise and complete documentation of the award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, further anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the public procurement regulations.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, for example, the responsible Federal Ministry for Procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,</seg>
<seg id="142">with the award data - such as the estimated costs and the order amounts - as well as information on the involved freelancers are collected nationwide and evaluated for abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, form the most important basis for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on anti-corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of the measures recommended therein have already been incorporated into national public procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions around14.</seg>
<seg id="147">The main provisions of the new legislation are as follows: reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation to publish the contracts beforehand by the contracting authority, including mention of the reasons for the tender, prohibition of limiting the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus abolition of the possibility of selecting bidders through lottery procedures, introduction of the obligation to publish the order documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Examination results for the individual phases of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Procurement Documents The Procurement Documents must contain all the information that the bidders need to make an appropriate bid.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the award documents must allow for a correct calculation.</seg>
<seg id="152">The bidders may not be transferred any risks that are not calculable for them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The award documents consist in particular of the service description and the contractual conditions.</seg>
<seg id="154">In addition, they contain the requirements for proof of the qualification (fitness) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.</seg>
<seg id="155">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="156">The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are directed in particular to the technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="157">These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="158">In principle, the service description must be product-neutral.</seg>
<seg id="159">Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.</seg>
<seg id="160">Avoiding restrictive competition requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of offers as well as for manipulation in their evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="162">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="163">Same or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for technical specifications have been transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="164">The services are basically product-neutral without factory specifications.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the service descriptions, the individual services must usually be divided into performance units with respective quantity specifications in detail.</seg>
<seg id="166">Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. B. Euro per m2 or per piece).</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.</seg>
<seg id="168">In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.</seg>
<seg id="170">Remuneration according to lump sum or time expenditure is to be avoided as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indeterminate requirements in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The call for tenders will not be published until the award documents have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Derogations from each other</seg>
<seg id="175">There is no obligation to tender for works in lots in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="176">If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public contracting authorities can divide construction services into several lots.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, construction services are generally divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and/or by type or subject area (professionals).</seg>
<seg id="178">The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to expand the number of possible providers and to make price agreements more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.</seg>
<seg id="180">Criteria for evaluation in the Czech Republic must be stated in the award documents, both in EU-wide and in national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should enable applicants to fully and conclusively identify the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in the EU-wide procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="183">In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be set out in an internal administrative award note.</seg>
<seg id="184">Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or experts in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="185">The aim is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contact with these freelancers without the client's knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send out award documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contact person for the companies is the client alone.</seg>
<seg id="188">There is currently no provision for this in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additional or modified services, which prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always required for large construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="190">In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of subcontracts to the already contracted company without having to carry out a tendering procedure with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="191">According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional services may not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to the award of such contracts without public notice.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.</seg>
<seg id="195">If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible according to the regulations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="196">In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed must be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.</seg>
<seg id="199">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, the performance descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">Some performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications – for example for graffiti protection, joints or noise protection plates – without this being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was considered.</seg>
<seg id="205">Performance directories subdivided by partial services</seg>
<seg id="206">The BRH has not in any of the examined proceedings found violations of the bid to advertise services in principle in a list of services subdivided by partial services.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="208">In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="209">In some cases, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the offer phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.</seg>
<seg id="210">Occasionally, the performance directories contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.</seg>
<seg id="211">A performance catalogue for demolition work even consisted almost half of such demand positions.</seg>
<seg id="212">Lots and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">Many awards lacked the prescribed reason why the services, which were mainly advertised according to the unemployed, were no longer divided into partial tickets.</seg>
<seg id="214">There were no objections when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="215">References to freelancers</seg>
<seg id="216">A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the involved freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="217">Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or reports.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender".</seg>
<seg id="219">In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities mainly attributed the complaints to the omissions of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="220">The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity to adequately control the performance descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="221">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral tender In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.</seg>
<seg id="223">The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.</seg>
<seg id="224">During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="225">Performance descriptions with performance units</seg>
<seg id="226">In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="227">As performance units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of the service descriptions</seg>
<seg id="229">During the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were changed four times within the framework of a non-open procedure in the period from August to September 2009,</seg>
<seg id="230">because the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.</seg>
<seg id="231">Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient structural preliminary investigations and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services to be commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="232">When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior equipment contained no requirements for product quality.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lots and aptitude criteria</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="236">An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts had been allocated separately, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible with a total cost of 620.3 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, six different buildings, which were the subject of a single contract, could have saved 2.5 million euros (25%) if they were awarded separately.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the construction of 20 bridges had been given off, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.</seg>
<seg id="239">When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the construction of a part of a motorway, the contracting authority demanded from the bidders in an open procedure, among other things, the proof of at least three road construction projects carried out, each worth 28 million euros from the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public procurement of another section of a motorway consisted of six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least 480 million euros in the last three years as an aptitude criterion for the companies.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were contracted by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.</seg>
<seg id="244">In 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even only one bidder submitted an offer.</seg>
<seg id="245">It showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Additional services</seg>
<seg id="247">When constructing a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the legally prescribed procedures when awarding additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.</seg>
<seg id="248">Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, additions were made in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21 % and 91 % respectively.</seg>
<seg id="249">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="250">For several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when awarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="251">Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without notice of award.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiation proceedings without a call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction period, the contracting authority expanded the scope of the work by 2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices for the additional works awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.</seg>
<seg id="255">Further findings</seg>
<seg id="256">On the basis of a sample test of construction projects, the NKA found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometer in the Czech Republic was up to 14.6 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="257">In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="260">The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="261">They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the service descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and prepare their offers appropriately,</seg>
<seg id="263">protect the client from additional services to be agreed retrospectively and also reduce the scope for speculation.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="265">There are no requirements to this extent in the Czech Republic, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="266">The requirements for the performance description have been largely met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which could also have led to restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The German law on the formation of lots promotes competition and leads to economic results.</seg>
<seg id="269">In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NK, the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots may result in restrictions of the provider field on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="270">The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="271">Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">In the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to the EU regulations as well as the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main order can be awarded under certain conditions without award procedures with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation procedure without notice.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="277">since the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the exceedance is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of award, the client determines the extent of the number of companies participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">It can leave the circle of potential applicants and bidders largely unlimited, for example by selecting an open procedure, or limit it by specifying non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="283">For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="285">When selecting the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European law bids on competition and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services are to be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="288">In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement and award construction services in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="289">A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated with too low cost values in order to remove it from the obligation to award construction services throughout Europe as a matter of principle.</seg>
<seg id="290">Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="291">The detailed justification of the chosen type of award and the examination of the application obligation of the EU procurement regulations are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on procurement procedures and the threshold value into national law.</seg>
<seg id="295">Derogations from each other</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EUR Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="297">There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or – in the case of national awards – the public tendering procedure generally takes precedence. This is determined by budgetary and public procurement law, as well as by the anti-corruption directives.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of award – as well as the non-open procedure or the restricted tender – are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by specifying on certain bidders and to make possible price agreements among bidders more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="302">The principle of public tendering is a central element of the prevention of corruption in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimation of the expected order value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.</seg>
<seg id="304">The construction offices in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain e.g. Cost parameters for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected order value of a planned advance or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.</seg>
<seg id="307">Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few construction administrations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.</seg>
<seg id="309">Procurement offices in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price analyses of comparable construction measures to determine the expected costs of construction services.</seg>
<seg id="310">In most cases, the cost estimates are based on estimates by the financing body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.</seg>
<seg id="312">Within the framework of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.</seg>
<seg id="313">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="314">This database is intended to collect information on the cost of materials and on construction and expansion works as well as other cost-relevant data in order to enable cost analyses and provisions of unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">In order to improve cost control, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects,</seg>
<seg id="316">which should serve as a benchmark for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="317">Key audit results BRH</seg>
<seg id="318">Choice of award procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities largely tendered the construction services in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus followed the budgetary and public procurement requirements.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the federal government's construction work in building construction was advertised publicly or in an open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">In the selection of non-public tender types, there were partly no detailed reasons why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.</seg>
<seg id="323">In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public tendering methods have significant competitive disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many offers as for free-handed contracts.</seg>
<seg id="325">The investigation also showed that the offer prices for restricted tenders and open-handed contracts were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a state accounting court confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement types.</seg>
<seg id="327">As a result of its studies on cost-effectiveness, the Federal Ministry of Construction even came up with twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Taking into account the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="329">In the case of the construction projects for which they had determined an estimated total order amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually drew up award plans in which they determined the construction services to be awarded in accordance with EU-wide and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of the construction work had to be awarded throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">A circumvention of the obligation to award EU-wide contracts through cost estimates that were too low was not detectable.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, it was partly due to incorrect calculations that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures actually fell short.</seg>
<seg id="333">During construction, some contracting authorities inadmissibly changed the definitions of their procurement plans.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures was still respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">For most of the examined construction measures, the share of EU-wide contracts was usually lower according to the billing results than provided for under the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities breached the requirement to advertise all 1,000,000 euros and more comprehensive individual cases in EU-wide procedures.</seg>
<seg id="337">and instead chose national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="338">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of type of award</seg>
<seg id="340">In several major construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects as part of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.</seg>
<seg id="341">As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in violation of legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="342">Calculation methods for the estimated order value</seg>
<seg id="343">In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an insufficient instrument for determining the expected order values.</seg>
<seg id="344">The data were based on just completed construction projects, but there were indications of a lack of cost-effectiveness, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contracted companies.</seg>
<seg id="345">For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined with the help of the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="347">In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.</seg>
<seg id="348">Actual order values differed greatly from the estimates.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, but eight additions in the course of construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros or 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.</seg>
<seg id="352">When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had only increased by 12%.</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have transposed into national law the EU rules for determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold value. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line with each other.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procurement procedures or public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="357">The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most economical results.</seg>
<seg id="358">The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not restricting the applicant field by tamper-prone stipulations of the client and by making price agreements between the bidders more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="359">The investigations have confirmed the advantageousness of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="360">Under Czech legislation, contracting authorities may award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in proceedings with previous competition.</seg>
<seg id="362">This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been unduly distributed in order to circumvent the criteria for selecting the type of award.</seg>
<seg id="364">When taking into account the EU threshold value, errors had to be detected in Germany which resulted in a fall in the minimum share of services advertised throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected costs of construction work and construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">The building authorities should, if necessary, ensure by means of further checks that the requirements for the choice of the type of award and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for appropriate cost investigations are created.</seg>
<seg id="367">Pre-information and notice</seg>

<seg id="371">The preliminary information should contain the essential information on the planned construction projects under public procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="372">They are necessary for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">In announcements, the client must provide more details on the construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="374">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other things, he has to make known the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.</seg>
<seg id="376">When describing the object of the order, the vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardized throughout Europe, must be used.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the client's procurement profile.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices may not contain any additional information at national level and may not be published until the publication text has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published for construction work not to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="385">Procurement procedures may be started at the earliest one month after sending the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the national Official Journal (for all awards).</seg>
<seg id="386">Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a preliminary information be dispensed with.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, no prior information is required for the non-EU procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions before restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Government's Internet portal and, if necessary, also in newspapers or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted tenders without participation competition, announcements of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.</seg>
<seg id="391">In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small part of the loose construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="392">In the Czech Republic, this regulation has only a small impact, as much less construction work is divided into lots.</seg>
<seg id="393">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Preliminary information</seg>
<seg id="396">The surveyed contracting authorities published preliminary information on all tested construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open proceedings, however, they shortened offer periods, although the period of 52 days required between the dispatch of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the twelve-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.</seg>
<seg id="399">Many published preliminary information lacked references to the planned division of construction services into lots.</seg>
<seg id="400">Announcements</seg>
<seg id="401">The notices of the audited bodies partly contained CPV codes which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not correctly record the required services.</seg>
<seg id="402">In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information – e.g. on implementation deadlines – than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="405">This published the notifications on its own fee-based procurement platform.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the notifications as prescribed to the free internet portal of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="407">Samples showed that only one third of the reports from the audited administration were published on this portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="409">Announcements</seg>
<seg id="410">When constructing a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.</seg>
<seg id="411">The contracting authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.</seg>
<seg id="412">The limitation of the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in detail either in the announcement or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it would evaluate the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="414">In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="415">The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because at no time in the procedure had it disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of the announcements</seg>
<seg id="417">During the renovation of former military premises, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.</seg>
<seg id="418">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage teaching system with pre-information and notice is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">Both countries have implemented the EU rules and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures also in the national procurement sector:</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of applicants for non-public tender types</seg>
<seg id="422">In contrast to the public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition in the non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="423">In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a selection in advance as to which companies should be invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption The EU regulations allow a limitation of the number of applicants in the EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="425">In the case of non-open procedures, however, at least five companies must be invited to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="426">At least three companies must be invited to negotiate with a contract announcement.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of companies to be invited is a process within the award procedure that is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. by allowing certain companies to be given unilateral preference.</seg>
<seg id="430">In addition, limiting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both cases, the delivery result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.</seg>
<seg id="432">The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulations, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="435">The rules for selecting applicants are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should switch among the companies to be invited as often as possible when selecting applicants.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor must competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The contracting authorities must justify the selection of candidates and document the process of the selection process in their award notes.</seg>
<seg id="439">Derogations from each other</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, in the case of restricted tenders, at least three and in the case of free-handed contracts, several suitable applicants must be invited to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="441">Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.</seg>
<seg id="443">For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction office or an agent from the contracting authority must usually amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and/or supplementing a new company.</seg>
<seg id="444">The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to definitively determine the circle of companies to be involved in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching agreements between the parties involved.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of companies to be requested is to be treated confidentially – also with regard to freelancers – and not to be made accessible to the general public.</seg>
<seg id="447">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic there are no corresponding regulations for the establishment and secrecy of applicant lists.</seg>
<seg id="449">According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is a loophole in Czech legislation in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="451">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of applicants</seg>
<seg id="454">The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit tenders for non-public contracts has been complied with, with a few exceptions.</seg>
<seg id="455">An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European procurement procedures for construction services in building construction showed that the contracting authorities requested an average of 6.6 for restricted tenders of the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for tenders for free-handed contracts.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of companies and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">Especially for trades with few providers, the contracting authorities did not always change the circle of selected applicants.</seg>
<seg id="458">Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and proven in their view.</seg>
<seg id="459">As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete even before the invitation to submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="460">The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services in the non-public procurement procedures was on average much lower and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Multi-eye principle and proposals for freelance workers</seg>
<seg id="463">Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely omitted to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.</seg>
<seg id="464">They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.</seg>
<seg id="465">Often it was also not documented who had proposed the companies requested to submit the offer.</seg>
<seg id="466">Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the applicant lists and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="467">Thus, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidential treatment of bidding lists</seg>
<seg id="469">At a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.</seg>
<seg id="470">In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or authorised companies would have been passed on unauthorised and e.g. Arrangements among these companies may allow.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="473">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection of candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders received no information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="476">In the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the announcements did not contain any information on how the selection of applicants should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="477">In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="478">The award committee then carried out a lottery procedure for selecting the companies.</seg>
<seg id="479">However, this approach, which was generally permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="481">Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German regulations restrict such possibilities of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can in particular counteract possible manipulative restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the deficits identified.</seg>
<seg id="486">Offer phase</seg>
<seg id="487">With the announcement of the award or with the invitation to tender, the offer phase begins, in which the companies can prepare offers on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.</seg>
<seg id="488">Applicants can submit their offers until the end of the offer period set by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="490">There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authorities have to comply with the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation existing during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="492">These are mainly organizational requirements and controls.</seg>
<seg id="493">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="495">The award documents on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their offers are, in principle, only to be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Freelancers involved in the award procedure may not perform this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information even during the offer phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">In case of ambiguity regarding the award documents or other questions concerning the tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="499">Freelance workers commissioned to draw up the award documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the entire offer phase, contact between the employed freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="501">Freelance workers must not become a hub of the award procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.</seg>
<seg id="502">Offers sent directly or by post must be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Offers transmitted electronically have a technical encryption.</seg>
<seg id="504">Derogations from each other</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="506">The offers received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and forwarded immediately, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for custody.</seg>
<seg id="507">This employee may not be involved in the awarding of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="508">The offers received are to be kept under lock until the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority records the offer data including order numbers as well as the creation and receipt details in a protocol.</seg>
<seg id="511">The custody of offers is not regulated in detail in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="512">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">The tests for the offer phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building administration.</seg>
<seg id="515">Dispatch of the award documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The contracting authorities of the audited building administration sent the award documents themselves or had them printed and shipped by an external service company.</seg>
<seg id="517">Freelance workers did not send out any award documents.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to applicants</seg>
<seg id="519">The audited building administration largely did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding when naming the contact persons for queries and information.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting office, but from the project management as contact persons.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some award documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had created the service descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="522">For inquiries during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="523">Labelling of bids</seg>
<seg id="524">At the audited building management, all received offers were provided with an entrance stamp and an entrance note.</seg>
<seg id="525">In some hands-free contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the preliminaries to the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Preservation of offers</seg>
<seg id="527">According to their labelling, not all offers were received immediately and immediately by the employee responsible for custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">In the meantime, the offers were stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which each employee had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another office had hung up a mailbox in a not constantly monitored hallway, in which the offers thrown in there sometimes even stayed overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">Since the insertion slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only employees but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to take received offers and, if necessary, manipulate them.</seg>
<seg id="531">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="532">No defects were objected to on the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="534">During the offer phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="535">By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.</seg>
<seg id="536">The regulations governing the receipt, custody and confidentiality of the offers appear to be suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening up of offers</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening up of offers</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.</seg>
<seg id="543">From the opening date, the bidders are bound to their bids until the expiry of the surcharge period specified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="545">There are no separate EU regulations for the opening of bids.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, for this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure, the national anti-corruption regulations contain extensive requirements for the protection of offers and competition.</seg>
<seg id="547">The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and comprehensibility of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulations and changes to the submitted offers.</seg>
<seg id="548">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.</seg>
<seg id="552">In most tendering procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="553">Only offers which were submitted to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are allowed to open.</seg>
<seg id="554">Offers received late may in principle no longer be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol containing, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices.</seg>
<seg id="556">The Minutes are to be read out and signed by the negotiators.</seg>
<seg id="557">It can also be signed by the bidders present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Derogations from each other</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a committee carries out the opening of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="560">Freelance workers can also participate.</seg>
<seg id="561">The Committee may also be entrusted with further phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.</seg>
<seg id="563">The negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.</seg>
<seg id="564">The negotiator and, in the case of contracts in building construction, also the secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the awarding and contract processing.</seg>
<seg id="565">According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date must include not only the offer prices but also information about Skonti and discounts as well as special features such as damaged or delayed offers.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="567">The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.</seg>
<seg id="568">The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for the processing.</seg>
<seg id="569">Corresponding Czech regulations do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="570">If only one offer is received in a tender procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unvalued.</seg>
<seg id="571">There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received here, it must be opened and then evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="573">BRH</seg>
<seg id="574">Multi-eye principle</seg>
<seg id="575">The audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.</seg>
<seg id="576">They held the opening appointments with negotiators and secretaries who were not charged with any other award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in the case of freelancers, there were occasional cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Minutes</seg>
<seg id="579">In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Labelling of bids</seg>
<seg id="582">The contracting authorities examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination marked the offers according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="583">In the case of tests carried out by some beneficiaries over a longer period of time, insufficient labelling had been found.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="585">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="586">Offer period</seg>
<seg id="587">When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the offer period. The contracting authority nevertheless accepted this offer.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="589">The rules governing the opening up of tenders in both countries are in agreement in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of offers can be significantly limited.</seg>
<seg id="590">The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the labelling, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict manipulation possibilities such as subsequent changes to the offers.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, those commissioned with the opening of the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The overall few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of offers</seg>
<seg id="595">Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="596">He has to determine the offer for the award of the contract, which corresponds best to the requirements according to the specified award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="598">The EU guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:</seg>
<seg id="599">First of all, the suitability of the bidders has to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="600">Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and possess the necessary professional and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="601">Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, must be excluded from participating in the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="602">The offers of the not excluded bidders are to be examined mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices must be examined by the client in particular.</seg>
<seg id="604">The examination and evaluation of the offers is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the valuation result can be improperly impaired and thus the determination of the economically most advantageous offer can be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the examination and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.</seg>
<seg id="608">It must also ensure the transparency and comprehensibility of the procedure and the decisions taken.</seg>
<seg id="609">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="611">In accordance with the requirements of the EU, the offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements for the aptitude certificates to be submitted by the companies as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the announcements or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">After checking the suitability of the bid, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.</seg>
<seg id="614">The valuation must be limited to the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The submitted offers must first be formally checked immediately to see whether they are complete and whether, for example, they are complete. Abnormalities are included, which could indicate possible manipulation intentions.</seg>
<seg id="616">If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the valuation of the offers gives an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.</seg>
<seg id="618">The decisions made during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="619">Derogations from each other</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly commissioned with the processing.</seg>
<seg id="621">The review of the offers as well as the computational examination of the offers may only be carried out by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="622">It only has to appoint staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.</seg>
<seg id="623">The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.</seg>
<seg id="624">If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be formed for the examination and evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.</seg>
<seg id="628">Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="629">If evidence or declarations required for the submission of an offer in Germany are only incompletely filed, the contracting authority shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is to be excluded from the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.</seg>
<seg id="634">If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id="635">If he fails to do so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases in construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price is valued, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.</seg>
<seg id="638">A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">A surcharge may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more offers fall below the correct price determination of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10 % or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their offers.</seg>
<seg id="641">If this is not possible for them, the contracting authority may exclude the relevant offers.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after the cost-effectiveness check if only offers with non-justifiable at low prices are available.</seg>
<seg id="643">In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge cannot be refused for offers with prices substantially higher than the client's calculation for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must report immediately to its specialist supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">It has to decide which measures have to be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.</seg>
<seg id="646">The leading level of supervision must, for example, also agree on construction services of more than 50,000 euros if a contract is to be awarded freely, if a surcharge is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Suitability and evaluation criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">The vast majority of the audited procurement procedures corresponded to the specified requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being available in full.</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, it was not comprehensible whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the award criteria announced in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the criterion "price".</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of persons involved and confidentiality of offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities used persons who were not authorised to do so when examining the offers.</seg>
<seg id="657">For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacities in the respective areas.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, the freelancers commissioned with the examination of the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfill the contractual obligations.</seg>
<seg id="660">For the construction services it was usually also not comprehensible whether the offers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing by the freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and computational examination of the offers</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting authorities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and having documented their results.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="664">In the audited documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partially not or only inadequately marked.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">For a sample in a building administration, the cheapest offers for three quarters of the audited procurement procedures differed more than 10% from the previously determined estimation costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">Every 20th award procedure has been cancelled because of inappropriate offer prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">Not all bidding examinations and reconnaissance discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, more detailed explanations were missing, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.</seg>
<seg id="670">Often the deviations were only generally justified, e.g. by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction services explained that it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of a tender for an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined estimate of these services.</seg>
<seg id="673">Further calculation tests or investigations on the causes of this deviation were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="674">In an enlightenment interview, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then commissioned company.</seg>
<seg id="675">As a result, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the client rated the commissioned company as a "cheap company" that could not keep quality or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another tender, a construction agency awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost determination.</seg>
<seg id="678">It did not cancel the invitation to tender, citing the unfamiliar justification that this company could be concluded on an adequate calculation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspicion of irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">In the case of an audited building administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the technical supervisor.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both offers from the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the application of the remaining regulations, the tests did not give rise to any significant complaints.</seg>
<seg id="683">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="684">Aptitude test</seg>
<seg id="685">For many of the examined construction projects, including university construction, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Valuation</seg>
<seg id="687">When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria in the examination and evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="688">In a construction project for the expansion of the railway network, the contracting authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of road maintenance measures, the prescribed criterion "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the offered shortening was insufficiently taken into account by bidders in second and third positions.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the offer selection</seg>
<seg id="692">In three award procedures in the context of housing promotion, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.</seg>
<seg id="693">In the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.</seg>
<seg id="694">Tests of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="696">The regulations for the examination and evaluation of offers in both countries comply with the requirements of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="697">For details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, however, the respective regulations differ from each other.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, the procedure is regulated more strongly than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular regarding the implementation of the multi-eye principle and the protection of offers.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, it had to be established in some of the audited procurement procedures that essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or only insufficiently documented.</seg>
<seg id="701">Without comprehensibility and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the public client having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulations in the further proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="703">If public clients have tasks carried out by third parties in the examination and evaluation of the offers, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">When assessing the appropriateness of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly in the aptitude test as well as in the application of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the award procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After checking and values of the offers, the award procedure is concluded by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">The companies have the possibility to examine the intended award in the case of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or with other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="711">A contract may not be concluded before this information period expires.</seg>
<seg id="712">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="713">If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, the conclusion of a contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">The companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court within the framework of this review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="715">The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the client to observe the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="716">To do this, he must sufficiently document the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="717">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.</seg>
<seg id="722">The client shall place the order within the announced surcharge period,</seg>
<seg id="723">also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="724">In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="725">The inferior bidders are to be informed promptly about the award decision and the reasons for not taking their offers into account.</seg>
<seg id="726">Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g. if the offer prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="727">Derogations from each other</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, there is a 10- or 15-day obligation to provide information and to wait before awarding a contract, even for construction services that are not to be awarded throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.</seg>
<seg id="730">In the case of the other proceedings in Germany, the bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, a tender procedure must be cancelled if only one offer has been received or only one offer could be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economical.</seg>
<seg id="733">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, companies received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the end of the information periods, which may lead to the invalidity of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In individual cases, order letters also contained content deviating from the content of the offer, such as changed dates, according to open procedures.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, the contracting authorities did not meet the award deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="739">In the case of an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract to the second most favourable offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the originally offered price after the expiry of the award period.</seg>
<seg id="740">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated in terms of content from the bidder's offer.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some contracts, e.g. for road maintenance construction measures, for the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the statutory period.</seg>
<seg id="743">When awarding construction services for the renovation of former military premises, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after the expiry of the statutory period.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements to complete the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of the inferior applicants or bidders increases the tools for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In future, the construction authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.</seg>
<seg id="753">The contracts awarded must be made known in EU-wide procedures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The order data is also recorded in an EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of the procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="756">A carefully and promptly created documentation enables the traceability of the award decisions.</seg>
<seg id="757">In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to justify award decisions in detail significantly restricts the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">The announcement of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be submitted by the respective contracting authority to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the announcements in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the EU Commission compiles an annual EU statistics, through which it can gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.</seg>
<seg id="763">Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar rules</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.</seg>
<seg id="766">The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Derogations from each other</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notice period is shortened to 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only in the case of restricted tenders and in the case of free-handed contracts from value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without value added tax (so-called "VAT"). Ex-post transparency).</seg>
<seg id="771">Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information about the award of contracts.</seg>

<seg id="773">BRH</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of the audited award procedures were not fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.</seg>
<seg id="777">In a tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.</seg>
<seg id="778">In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="779">Announcements on the award of orders</seg>
<seg id="780">In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to make the awarding of contracts known.</seg>
<seg id="781">Further award procedures lacked the evidence that the contracting authorities had made the awarded contracts known.</seg>
<seg id="782">Reporting and reporting obligations</seg>
<seg id="783">The statistical listings viewed contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and dispatched on time.</seg>
<seg id="784">Ex-post transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the audited building authorities published the order data of the completed procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="786">However, a construction administration did not publish this data due to a transmission error.</seg>
<seg id="787">The building administration noticed this mistake only after half a year,</seg>
<seg id="788">so that the order data of the procurement procedures completed up to that time have not been published.</seg>
<seg id="789">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings. These were mainly inaccurate information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the valuation commissions.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some minutes of the offer openings were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Announcements on the award of orders</seg>
<seg id="794">In the case of several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were published only belatedly or not at all.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary findings</seg>
<seg id="796">The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting obligations are broadly consistent in both countries and implement EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="797">The transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.</seg>
<seg id="798">The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the requirements in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="799">The shortcomings in the documentation and in the announcements shown limited the orruption-preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">The building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and assignments and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits carried out by the NCA and the BRH have focused on two main areas that are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works by public authorities: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">The requirements of EU law will allow cross-border competition to create a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Anti-corruption measures not only serve to prevent or at least reduce corruption. They should also avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two audit bodies on the application of the public procurement rules in both countries and the comparison of these regulations provide information on similarities and differences, which can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their procurement law and its application.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU public procurement rules</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed the EU's requirements for the award of construction services into national law.</seg>
<seg id="809">Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of works and the consideration of the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">The building authorities of both countries have partly backed these bids very extensively by further administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has also largely transferred the requirements for the construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="813">The building administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints raised when implementing the EU regulations.</seg>
<seg id="814">In particular, the audits in the Czech Republic have identified risks that affect the cost-effectiveness of the awards.</seg>
<seg id="815">For example, incomplete service descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, the cost assessments were usually insufficiently prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the transport sector.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">The investigations have not had the aim of uncovering cases of corruption,</seg>
<seg id="818">also because the Court of Auditors does not have the appropriate instruments for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of works and how these requirements are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">In preventing corruption, both countries have set different priorities.</seg>
<seg id="821">Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="826">In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very precisely how the bids for the prevention of corruption must be taken into account in the course of the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="827">The BRH considers, in particular, that the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is a suitable instrument for significantly reducing the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative intervention.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organizational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.</seg>
<seg id="830">The anti-corruption rules are largely taken into account in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the benchmarks.</seg>
<seg id="832">The building authorities should continue to train their employees on the requirements for corruption prevention and make them even more aware of this problem.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.</seg>
<seg id="835">Therefore, manipulation and corruption-prone tasks should only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.</seg>
<seg id="836">N.K.</seg>
<seg id="837">The Czech Republic adopted at government level a strategy against corruption, in which the area of public procurement is the most important component.</seg>
<seg id="838">The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.</seg>
<seg id="839">The examinations of the NCD took place during the implementation of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the profitability of the award of contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the appropriateness of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations and must properly document and publish all these aspects.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">In principle, the NCC and the BRH rate the implementation of the EU requirements positively.</seg>
<seg id="843">The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's rules on competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous material and ideal damage potential caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both courts of auditors see the construction authorities in their countries as being required to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.</seg>
<seg id="847">The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="848">A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a favourable effect on supply prices, provided that this leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient awarding of contracts by public authorities.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialized building authorities. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks – with the exception of transport construction projects – are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.</seg>
<seg id="851">The Court of Auditors of both countries has the intention, even after the completion of their joint project, to further develop the relevant findings for them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.</seg>
<seg id="852">Both audit institutions are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The principles and findings set out above are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the audit</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreword</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes are the main source of income for public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="5">A focus of the Court of Auditors' activities should therefore be on the audit of this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">This applies in particular to VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">This alone causes annual tax losses in the European Union of an estimated EUR 100 billion1.</seg>
<seg id="8">Already at the 6th EUROSAI Congress 2005 in Bonn, the participants pointed out the need for increased cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">This makes it possible for the Court of Auditors, e.g. Exchange examination approaches and optimise the examination practice.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2006, for the first time, the courts of auditors of both countries conducted parallel audits in the area of the USt.</seg>
<seg id="12">The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since USt fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the courts of auditors is needed. This allows a comprehensive assessment of whether the measures taken are suitable for effectively countering the USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two audit bodies decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Examination number:(CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Administration of the USt (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as NKx), audit</seg>
<seg id="18">The aim of the audit is to:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The USt administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities in intergovernmental mutual assistance should be examined.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit should evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the audit bodies.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, further examination fields - linked to the USt - should be processed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The findings should be compared in order to determine whether tax procedures can be optimised.</seg>
<seg id="23">The examination period was the years 2006 to 2008 including relevant information from the period before the examination period up to the conclusion of the examination.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination</seg>
<seg id="25">The courts of auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on an audit for the administration of the USt.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the previous parallel examination, they had uncovered suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,</seg>
<seg id="27">which made a re-examination purpose appear.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the audit findings, the two Court of Auditors issued recommendations for the administration of the USt.</seg>
<seg id="29">The aim of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the identified suspected cases should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The examination also dealt with other issues. These included selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of USt claims and the USt audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Court of Auditors found that:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous audit</seg>
<seg id="33">Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the registration procedures for the USt in the two states and found differences that caused problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxable persons within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This has also been taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798/2003 provides for the extension of the existing databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of USt persons.</seg>
<seg id="38">The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible deletion.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Court of Auditors expected Member States to agree, in accordance with their decision in principle, on appropriate arrangements to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the USt system as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the final version of the draft.</seg>
<seg id="41">The above-mentioned common rules are no longer included. The two Court of Auditors regret this.</seg>
<seg id="42">They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary notifications As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended that Member States submit summary notifications (CMs) on a monthly basis in the future.</seg>
<seg id="44">The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed more closely.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the deadline for the surrender of the ZM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, implementation did not enter into force until 1 July 2010. It has thus failed to transpose the obligation to submit the ZM monthly into national law on time.</seg>
<seg id="48">Recommendation 3: Data synchronisation of USt pre-registrations and ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of procedures for USt pre-registrations and ZM The German financial administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Federal Audit Office will monitor the further development.</seg>
<seg id="51">Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level In the course of the first audit, the two audit bodies agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Audit Office focused on the German participation in the "Platform for Risk Management".</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Verification of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">At the first audit, the Court of Auditors had jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or those of the taxable persons of the two states in the USt pre-registrations (or. USt declarations) or ZM had been explained differently.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for the audit.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits by the tax offices (FÄ) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit showed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. The respective financial administrations had taken appropriate measures to this end (e.g. subsequent USt fixes or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community sales</seg>
<seg id="62">The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between taxable persons in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is used to identify taxable persons at risk.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the point of view of an active participating state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with German USt-ID would have been classified as highly risky cases.</seg>
<seg id="68">The NKU found both normal business transactions and those suspected of USt fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected sales.</seg>
<seg id="69">The FÄ were only able to examine sales with high risk to a limited extent. This was particularly true for so-called "missing traders", whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to be able to prove fraud to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">Suspicion of carousel fraud in imports and exports</seg>
<seg id="71">it is advisable for customs and tax authorities to work more closely together in order to be able to track the originality of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany and a number of other countries have refused to participate actively in EUROCANET because they do not believe that there is a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Bundesrechnungshof found that the German tax administration uses other instruments to identify taxable persons at risk.</seg>
<seg id="74">However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation:</seg>
<seg id="76">was created by the EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network for combating USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are dealt with in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="81">Bundesrechnungshof and NKU compared the statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">These statistics contained inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two Court of Auditors consider it useful to re-discuss statistics at EU level in order to avoid any remaining inconsistencies in the future.</seg>
<seg id="84">If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the statistics should contain more information about the USt.</seg>
<seg id="86">An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">Both audit institutions believe that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Commission should support the Member States in this, if desired.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. USt testing at large companies</seg>
<seg id="90">The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation regarding the USt audit of large companies in both states.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they collected information from the financial administrations with a questionnaire, which they considered important in this context.</seg>
<seg id="92">It became clear that the situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="93">CZ has a system for selecting risky cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on USt audits, balance sheet data, and profit and loss statements).</seg>
<seg id="94">As a result, the USt control can be effectively controlled and analyzed overall.</seg>
<seg id="95">A special finance office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">Germany does not yet have a comparable system. This complicates the control and analysis of the USt control as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="97">The German financial administration concentrates more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the USt pre-registrations or USt declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="98">Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Examination procedure</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">Division II - Government Budget Revenues as well as the Regional Departments I-Pilsen, I-Eesk-Budjovice, xiii Brno and xv Ostrava audited in the period May 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="102">Certified bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FÄ: Tax Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Beclav, FA in Doma-lice, FA in Hodon-n, FA in Hradec Kr-lov, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA in Ostrava, FA in</seg>
<seg id="103">The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Examination procedures in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich examined from February 2009 to February 2010.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the examples, they announced the examination in several countries:</seg>
<seg id="107">Bavaria, Hamburg, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony. In addition, they conducted interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files from the following FÄ were included in the audit: - Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; - Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg für Großunternehmen; - Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; - Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; - Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="109">Discussions were also held with FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and OFD Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors</seg>
<seg id="112">In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both audit bodies met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">In December 2008, the Presidents of both Courts of Auditors signed the agreement on co-operation in the parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams informed themselves about the initial results obtained during the examination preparation, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on the next steps.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The examination teams exchanged the audit findings obtained up to that point and agreed on the timetable for the preparation of the joint audit report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two audit bodies set out the following topics for their parallel audit: - Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; - Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and from Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; - Review of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany; - Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of U.S. claims; - Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations in respect</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Examination of the management of VAT in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint audit</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU Supported</seg>
<seg id="124">on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended adapting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for the deletion of registration in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="125">These amended rules should reduce the risk of possible tax evasion more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="126">In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxable persons if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No. 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "USt Act").</seg>
<seg id="127">So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige the FÄ to delete if the taxable persons repeatedly do not submit USt declarations.</seg>
<seg id="128">Under the Czech USt Act, the FA may ex officio delete the registration of a taxable person if a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for doing so; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the USt Act; c) the taxable person no longer meets the requirements for tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="129">The first examination had shown that, due to the existing legal situation, FA Prague 1 must delete the USt registration of "foreign taxable persons"3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year, if they were not obliged to register and pay USt in the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the USt registration of these taxable persons, because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was solved by the amendment of the USt Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">Accordingly, the FA is authorized to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if he has not provided taxable or tax-exempt goods deliveries or services with the right to deduct input tax in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly submission of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="135">On the basis of the first audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle for the surrender of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The ZM must now be delivered electronically.</seg>
<seg id="138">In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with Section 9(1) of the UST Act are provided for a person registered in another Member State as subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="139">The prerequisite is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the USt for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation related to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically compares the data on intra-Community transactions from the USt declarations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">The proper collection of the USt is an essential prerequisite for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">That is why the fight against USt fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.</seg>
<seg id="148">In it, an external expert estimated the USt failure for the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006. After evaluating the available data, the tax loss for the period mentioned was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros. This was based on the fact that the EU-25 loses an average of 12% of the turnover taxes due to them each year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The estimated tax loss for CZ in 2006 was 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first audit found that a Member State cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">In relation to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).</seg>
<seg id="153">Risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxable persons within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected for this purpose (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The EUROFISC network aims to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat USt fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities should be improved in order to detect fraud as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to estimate the risk potential of intra-Community sales.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council6 already approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.</seg>
<seg id="157">The model for EUROFISC is EUROCANET, which was developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7.</seg>
<seg id="158">The purpose of the system is to uncover risky sales and identify entrepreneurs involved in organized USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report led to the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">Based on a detailed questionnaire, the German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system itself is constantly being improved.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data provided in the questionnaire is now collected electronically and will later be available for research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission had made a proposal8 to amend Regulation 1798/2003. This included common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="168">There was still a need for clarification and clarification in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly submission of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, a law9 on the transposition of EU directives into national law was passed.</seg>
<seg id="173">It contains, among other things, Provisions for the monthly levy of the ZM for intra-Community deliveries</seg>
<seg id="174">and enters into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the USt pre-registrations and the ZM</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint federal-state working group has been set up,</seg>
<seg id="178">which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the USt pre-registrations and the ZM.</seg>
<seg id="179">The concept is still under discussion with the countries.</seg>
<seg id="180">In addition, this working group dealt with a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level At EU level, relevant information is exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the initiative and, by written procedure dated 18 October 2006, initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the "Fiscalis 2006-2007" action plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform dealt in 4 sub-groups with the following topics: risk management tools, influencing the behaviour of taxable persons, evaluation, updating the risk management guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports from the Risk Management Instruments subgroups and the Update of the Risk Management Guide were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The question of the requirements for USt registration and its deletion in different countries has been dealt with at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amended Council Regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of the existing databases within the EU, including a database of USt identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="192">The questions of registration and deletion are reserved until further notice for the national legislation of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">There was still a need for clarification and clarification in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="194">The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">Member States reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="196">It no longer contains common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="197">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>

<seg id="200">Monthly submission of the ZM</seg>
<seg id="201">With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous examination, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the rate of payment of the corresponding ZM to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not implement the obligation to pay the monthly ZM tax until 1 July 2010 and thus not on time, while the CZ complied with the requirements of the EU.</seg>

<seg id="209">Germany and CZ use different approaches to identify high-risk entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">The Federal Audit Office focused on Germany's participation in the risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Verification of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">The first audit examined jointly transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether discrepancies had been found in the notifications of taxable persons in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two audit bodies selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for the audit, for which the tax audit by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">A Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 22 686 euros from a German taxable person in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxable person did not declare the acquisition in his USt declaration,daderGerman taxable person mentioned period had no USt identification number, but only a tax number for domestic German sales.</seg>
<seg id="218">Through international mutual assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that according to German USt law the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a USt identification number in order to be able to claim the tax exemption of intra-Community goods deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="219">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the examination of the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer filed an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods in the above-mentioned value and at the same time asserting his right to deduct VAT in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">A Czech taxable person is said to have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">However, he stated that he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not declare them in his USt statement.</seg>
<seg id="223">On the basis of a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German financial administration refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech FA could not obtain any documents, the tax audit remained inconclusive and the original tax determination remained in place.</seg>
<seg id="225">The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxable person purchased the goods from the Slovak taxable person and stated the purchase in his regular USt declaration for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">A Czech taxable person is said to have purchased a car worth 48 500 euros from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, he did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, he had not made a U.S. declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the USt for the quarter in question at 0 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="231">Based on information transmitted from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA asked the taxpayer in March 2007 to file a subsequent tax return, but the taxpayer failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="232">The audit found that the FA had carried out further examinations in this tax case in 2007. It found that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the tax period December 2004, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="234">The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is unlikely to be recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">A Czech taxable person is said to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 with a total value of 198 167 euros.</seg>
<seg id="238">In response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, it was stated that tax proceedings were pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">The audit of the Federal Court of Auditors showed that after the conclusion of the proceedings there was evidence that the German taxpayer was involved in fraud.</seg>
<seg id="240">The intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to employment taxation in the amount of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration, a USt audit of the Czech taxable person took place for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">Based on the examination findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional USt of 703 031 CZK for May 2005 and 726 551 CZK for June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">Czech taxable person A is said to have purchased a machine with a total value of 58,000 euros from a German taxable person in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="246">The German taxable person is said to have delivered a machine worth 88 027 euros to Czech taxable person B in the third quarter of 2004. However, B denied the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had purchased the machine from a German company with a branch in CZ.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech taxable person A did not specify the purchase of the goods from the aforementioned German taxable person in his USt declaration.</seg>
<seg id="249">The reply of the German FA to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but a delivery within the CZ.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the audit, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after completion of an audit and that the USt exemption was subsequently refused.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">A German taxable person is said to have delivered goods worth 11 600 euros to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary USt declaration which inadmissibly identified acquisitions from another Member State, including acquisitions in the above amount.</seg>
<seg id="255">The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the USt declaration of the German taxable person and set additional USt in the amount of 1,600 euros.</seg>
<seg id="256">Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding USt investment there, an examination is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="257">The ZM of the German taxable person has not been corrected so far, since in Germany only the taxable person who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the question of the acquisition of a car worth 47 400 euros by a Czech taxable person in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After an examination for the tax period 2005 the Czech FA fixed the tax liability of the Czech taxable person with 0 CZK and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="261">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech USt official had been deleted because he had failed to comply with his tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="262">The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxable person has so far not corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax ruling.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person delivered goods with a total value of 33 205 euros to a Czech taxable person, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="266">The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA examined the reasons for the inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="267">For the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person repeatedly issued subsequent USt declarations.</seg>
<seg id="268">Nevertheless, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of CZK 134 273 in the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this on the grounds that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated and accepted the USt statements made.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person delivered goods worth 46 854 euros to a Czech taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only 14 856 euros.</seg>
<seg id="272">As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA checked the actual value of the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="273">With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31 998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.</seg>
<seg id="274">According to the results of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer had filed a subsequent USt declaration for the July 2004 tax period after repeated warnings from the FA in January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="275">With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct input tax. His tax liability for the tax period in question therefore remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial administrations in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (e.g. subsequent USt fixing or prevention of pre-tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be an important source of information to identify high-risk taxpayers in the Member State of acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the responsible FA with the purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on sales and taxable suppliers deemed to be risky in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech taxable persons were selected for the audit;</seg>
<seg id="283">which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="284">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German financial administration did not participate in the exchange of data via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with a German USt identification number were classified as risky by the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit identified both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">In the cases concerned, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,</seg>
<seg id="288">e.g. B:</seg>
<seg id="289">During the examination of the early warning information, the FÄ found no suspicion of risky sales.</seg>
<seg id="290">The taxable persons concerned were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">The FÄ did not manage to prove violations of the rules for calculating the tax base and the USt on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relations with letterbox companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxable persons did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The competent FÄ reviewed most of the risk-bearing taxable persons and transactions mentioned in EUROCANET's early warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="294">However, their possibilities for checking risky sales, especially so-called "missing traders", are limited.</seg>
<seg id="295">In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide evidence of fraudulent action by the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="296">Stricter requirements for the registration of taxable persons for USt purposes and greater flexibility in the deletion of registrations would be helpful to combat the USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="297">The taxable persons involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for USt purposes in order to fake fictitious deliveries of goods throughout the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to other taxable persons, with which they then assert unjustified claims for deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="298">In the event of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is advisable for customs and tax authorities to cooperate more closely in order to be able to monitor the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.</seg>
<seg id="299">Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Findings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">They served as a basis for the selection of six German taxable persons whose files were checked.</seg>
<seg id="304">Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send any data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is justified by the fact that “from the point of view of the Federal Government</seg>
<seg id="307">no unquestionable legal basis exists, which would make it possible to break the tax secrecy existing in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET".12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German FÄ receive control notifications about the direct business relations of the taxable persons registered with them with companies from other EU countries recorded in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the respective German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company based in another Member State, which is also in business relationship with the German company from the control communication.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="314">Accordingly, the examination in this area had to be carried out differently.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, there were no significant differences in the success of detecting USt fraud. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other instruments at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13, which created EUROFISC, a network to combat USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemption for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">Legislation on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:</seg>
<seg id="324">Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties and as regards VAT and certain excise duties; and</seg>
<seg id="326">Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed implementing provisions for certain articles of Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">The CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308/EEC by Law No. 252/2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, this too had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, an amendment to the aforementioned law was required.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, Amendment No 191/2004 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new relevant piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the Regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the respective original.</seg>
<seg id="332">Essential principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. The principle of reciprocity applies;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. Mutual assistance must always be provided only upon request and in the event that all conditions are met;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. Mutual assistance does not cover claims which are considered criminal sanctions in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. The procedure of intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. In the recovery process, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. Mutual assistance is provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. The principle of exhaustion applies: the requesting State shall use all means available to it under national law to recover the claim.</seg>
<seg id="340">Law No. 191/2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: provision of information, notification of legal acts and actual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The competent FA shall transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the recovery request together with the relevant documents electronically to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ via the respective Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the language in question, scans it with all facilities and transmits it via the communication network or the common interface CCN/CSI to the competent financial authority of the state concerned.</seg>
<seg id="344">A request for recovery aid must meet the following conditions: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">The receipt of requests from other Member States must be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance of the CZ as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.</seg>
<seg id="348">If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, citing the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.</seg>
<seg id="349">The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance examines whether the request meets all legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="351">It will then send the request to the relevant FA through the relevant Financial Directorate. If the recovery request is granted, the FA must, among other things, determine the debtor's financial circumstances, e.g. by extracts from the land register, enquiries about existing bank accounts and registration of vehicles at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="352">After six months from the date of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="353">The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons concerned are unavailable and the claim cannot therefore be settled.</seg>
<seg id="354">All sums successfully recovered must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech FA dealing with the recovery may, with the consent of the requesting State, agree to the claim for hours or payment of instalments.</seg>
<seg id="356">The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the delay period in accordance with Law No. 337/1992 on the administration of taxes and fees</seg>
<seg id="357">the requesting State shall be entitled to do so.</seg>
<seg id="358">In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ forwarded the recovery requests received to the relevant FA in a delayed manner.</seg>
<seg id="359">The same applied to the forwarding of the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ to the competent authority in the requested state.</seg>
<seg id="360">The investigation found that the Ministry of Finance had violated the Act on Intergovernmental Assistance for the Recovery of Claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="361">The situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">Pursuant to Section 13(4) of Law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall draw up statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This includes the number of requests submitted in the previous year and the requests received for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims.</seg>
<seg id="364">Based on the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission prepares its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit showed that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the CZ gave the claims by EUR 5 250 000 too low. The reason was the incorrect indication of the amount of a USt demand introduced in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal comma in the conversion of the claim of Czech crowns into euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual recovery assistance is presented in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal basis for intergovernmental mutual assistance in tax matters is Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive)14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178/2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementation Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Accession Directive codified Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">It regulates, among other things, the recovery of USt and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and default surcharges.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Contribution Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC)17 of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated by the German Tax Code (AO).</seg>
<seg id="374">Section 117 (2) AO provides that the tax authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal norms of the European Communities applicable in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Official Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of the AO (section 249-346) contains the legislation governing the enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative activities of the financial authorities regulate in particular the execution and enforcement instructions.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Financial Authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Tax Office18.</seg>
<seg id="378">General conditions for the admissibility of a recovery aid request are:</seg>
<seg id="379">The legal requirements must be met (Section 251, 254 AO).</seg>
<seg id="380">All recovery funds available domestically have been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">The claims for which mutual assistance is requested are incontestable.</seg>
<seg id="382">The period between the issuance of the Enforcement Order or the date on which the claim or title became unchallengeable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.</seg>
<seg id="383">The claim must be at least EUR 1 500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States The German requests for recovery of backward taxes are forwarded by the enforcement bodies of the FÄ via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Tax Office of the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.</seg>
<seg id="385">The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental mutual assistance in tax collection (contribution) dated 19 January 200419.</seg>
<seg id="386">This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">In addition to attachments, the request will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the Central Authority.</seg>
<seg id="388">The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If not, the request will be returned to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="390">Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Tax Office then takes over the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedures for incoming requests from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="393">Requests for recovery from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a confirmation of receipt within ten days.</seg>
<seg id="394">It also checks whether the formal requirements are met.</seg>
<seg id="395">In principle, the Federal Central Office for Taxes passes these requests on to the Central Authority, which directs them to the relevant FA and monitors the completion.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim or final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">If the processing of a request lasts longer than six months, it reminds the Central Authority of the obligation to submit an interim report pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EC.</seg>
<seg id="398">After examining the formal and factual conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies announce relevant measures.</seg>
<seg id="399">All amounts added must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.</seg>

<seg id="401">Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).</seg>
<seg id="402">4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases</seg>
<seg id="403">A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between CZ and Germany were selected for the examination. Ten cases are listed below, including:</seg>
<seg id="404">The following was noted:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for U.S. debt of a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 for a total amount of 3 883 euros (109 820 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="407">It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="408">For the purpose of securing the recoverable claim, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxable person with a land deposit right.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since the contaminated property was not sufficient to pay the entire tax liability, a payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was made with the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31 August 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. As a result, the taxpayer had paid a tax debt of CZK 49 600 in the meantime (as of 25 August 2009).</seg>
<seg id="411">The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on 28 August 2009, a further CZK 3 000 were transferred.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery request for tax debts (UST, income tax) as well as interest and fees of a Czech taxable person amounting to a total of 180 869 euros (Section 4 434 915 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="414">It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="415">After reviewing bank deposits, securities, real estate, motor vehicles, and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have attachable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Investigations on the ground also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for USt together with interest and fees totalling EUR 3 139 (Section 84 846 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="421">It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now paid the debt.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully settled his debt in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to the long time that the Czech Ministry of Finance needed to forward the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was found that the amount added was offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounted to EUR 6 649 and was to be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance there was only a recovery request of 3 139 euros for the company in question. The recovery request of 6 649 euros could not be found there.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees amounting to a total of 39 957 euros and 956 654 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="429">It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA.</seg>
<seg id="430">The recovery procedure was launched on 1 June 2009. A decision was taken to attach the Czech bank credit and the debtor's salary (7 000 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros per month in the past, but the responsible German FA did not agree.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxpayer promised to discuss his case with the German FA in order to agree on another amount.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax of the year 2005 as well as USt for the years 2003 to 2007 together with interest and fees totalling 113 444 Euro ’ 3 116 304 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="437">It was not until 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to FA Prague 1, which is not authorised to handle tax cases in the CZ resident taxable person; on the basis of the available address, a locally competent FA could not be determined.</seg>
<seg id="438">In its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008, according to which the debtor's income amounted to 4,704 euros. However, it could not issue an enforcement order because the recovery request had been received after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to attach the debtor's assets to credit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA asked for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of a U.S. debt together with procedural costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.</seg>
<seg id="443">It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the responsible German FA, through the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of EUR 17,700 – CZK 439 226 – which had been added by attachment of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="445">A conversion error was discovered during the review of the amounts added.</seg>
<seg id="446">The recoverable amount of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at the exchange rate of CZK 1 EUR 25.065, but a comma error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct amount of the recoverable amount amounted to 5 833 782 euros.</seg>
<seg id="448">As a result, a request for recovery of EUR 5 250 404 was made too low.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA asked for recovery on account of a U.S. debt plus interest and fees of a Czech taxable person totalling CZK 1 970 632 - EUR 79 847.</seg>
<seg id="451">It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="452">The German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.</seg>
<seg id="453">Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's revenues in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability. On 8 April 2009 - 4 600 euros, on 6 May 2009 -3 000 euros and on 16 June 2009 - 2 500 euros.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were transferred to the account of the responsible FA in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA asked for the recovery of tax debts totalling 398 653 euros, 9 832 779 CZK, including property acquisition tax.</seg>
<seg id="458">It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="459">In a letter from the German financial administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009, the request was returned.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration justified this on the grounds that the real estate acquisition tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">In addition, Article 2 g) relates to liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and assets not mentioned in Articles 1, paragraph 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new recovery request to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the real estate tax arrears in the amount of CZK 61 759, but the arrears in the USt, corporation tax and income tax.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the Czech FA in charge sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 – EUR 123 328.</seg>
<seg id="467">The USt debt was CZK 1 133 967.</seg>
<seg id="468">Only on the 18th. April 2007 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration</seg>
<seg id="469">and it was not until 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech FA the reply of the German Finance Administration of 9 November 2008. Brussels, 20 July 2007</seg>
<seg id="470">According to which the German FA issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account on 11 June 2007. The bank stated that it was not in a business relationship with the taxable person mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="471">Thus, the request for the German financial administration was deemed to have been settled.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the Czech FA sent a recovery request to the Czech Ministry of Finance for US-debt totalling CZK 1 296 845 – EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The responsible Finance Directorate sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German Finance Administration on 15 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before submitting the request, the Czech FA carried out the tax claim by attaching the accounts to banks and salary attachment as well as by burdening a property.</seg>
<seg id="477">Before the recovery request, an information request was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">According to the reply letter of 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxable person had his residence in Germany and had income from non-self-employment in the amount of 8 437 euros. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the recovery request and did not forward it to the relevant Czech FA until 12 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="479">According to this, the tax liability in Germany is not recoverable due to the insolvency of the debtor.</seg>
<seg id="480">No assets were found, the income from non-self-employment was already the subject of other enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German financial administration considered the request to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the case of recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU Member States for intergovernmental assistance.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in CZ and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The Federal Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors have compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">Disagreements arose.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States draw up their statistics with greater care.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a larger number of requests for mutual assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics have narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both Court of Auditors consider a renewed discussion at EU level on statistics to be useful in order to avoid the remaining inconsistencies in the future.</seg>
<seg id="490">If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics include both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. B. VAT, income tax) and the amount of the amounts added per Member State should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="492">Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by the Member States, the Commission could help Member States to assess their measures to combat USt fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors argues that Member States with a low rate should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.</seg>
<seg id="495">The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the competent FÄ, in particular in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="496">The same applies to the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="497">The investigation showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance was in breach of Law No. 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance in so far as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State within the six-month period from the date of receipt of the request on the progress of recovery measures.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Value Added Tax Examination at Large Enterprises</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Value Added Tax Examination at Large Enterprises in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">Background</seg>
<seg id="501">The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="502">The audit of large enterprises is regulated by Czech Law No. 337/1992, the "Tax and Fees Management Act".</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been established to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the tax period in question amounts to at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.</seg>
<seg id="504">The taxable person is a large company based on the amount of turnover. Income or corporation tax return classified in the respective tax period; for the first time for 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A natural or legal person will no longer be run as a large-scale business for the purpose of sales taxation if, in three consecutive investment periods, their net turnover in the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period for which lt for the first time. Tax return the requirements were met.</seg>
<seg id="506">A taxable person can only be deleted from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been checked beforehand for a tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">By the end of 2009, all large companies had been audited at least every five years.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, taxable persons have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on the proper determination and collection of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="509">The examinations by the FÄ should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually include several tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="510">The large taxable enterprises were audited by the special inspection bodies or audit services of the competent FÄ, which were set up for a total of 13 FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="511">A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the requirements of the Head of the Finance Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition, she also examined</seg>
<seg id="513">taxable persons with unusual and special business activities and</seg>
<seg id="514">those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="515">Taxable persons with complex location distribution and organizational structure are also examined,</seg>
<seg id="516">Taxable persons suspected of large-scale tax evasion</seg>
<seg id="517">as well as taxable persons belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified deduction of input tax.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information on the number of examinations carried out by the special audit bodies of the FÄ and the additional tax results of these examinations are shown in Table No. 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No. 531/1990 for the regional financial authorities. In particular, it proposes the creation of a special financial office with national competence for selected taxable persons (legal persons established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Value Added Tax Examination at Large Enterprises in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">Background</seg>
<seg id="522">The USt audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. The general provisions of the Tax Regulations (AO), the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and the Audit Regulations (BpO) apply to audits.</seg>
<seg id="523">There are also work aids.</seg>
<seg id="524">Tax regulation</seg>
<seg id="525">The provisions of Sections 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 - External Examination" contain, in particular, rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its substantive scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the examination announcement, examination principles, obligations of the taxable person to cooperate and prerequisites for final discussions as well as for the transmission of the audit report.</seg>
<seg id="526">External tests are carried out by the responsible FÄ (Section 195 AO).</seg>
<seg id="527">Financial Administration Act Pursuant to Section 5 (1) No. 1 in conjunction with Section 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Office for Taxes to participate in external audits of the FÄ.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and scope of this cooperation will be agreed between the authorities involved.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Office for Taxes may require that certain establishments it has renowned be audited at a certain point in time.</seg>
<seg id="530">In this case, it may lay down rules for the external audit of these taxable persons.</seg>
<seg id="531">Audit Regulations Pursuant to Article 108(7) GG, the Audit Regulations (BpO 2000) were adopted with the consent of the Federal Council.</seg>
<seg id="532">It applies to external audits of the state financial authorities and the Federal Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Pursuant to Section 3 BpO, the companies are regularly classified in size classes.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large companies must undergo a follow-up test (point 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">Pursuant to Section 33.1 BpO, each competent financial authority shall maintain a group directory within the meaning of the provision.</seg>
<seg id="536">Administrative work aids</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the following working aids have been issued for the administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">- "Single Handbook for the USt Special Examination";</seg>
<seg id="539">Turnover Tax-Country-Online - USLO (dialogue system in the intra-Community USt control procedure) with instructions on how to use the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;</seg>
<seg id="540">Work aids for difficult and special situations.</seg>
<seg id="541">Central database for the storage and evaluation of USt fraud cases and the development of risk profiles -ZAUBER;</seg>
<seg id="542">Taxable persons are classified in size classes. These are based on criteria such as turnover and profit, whereby the limit values vary depending on the branch of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies - not only large enterprises - is to be determined regularly (last cut-off date: 1 January 2010).</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, large companies have to be checked completely.</seg>
<seg id="547">The tests are announced and usually extend to the USt,</seg>
<seg id="548">i.e. the audit covers all relevant taxes, i.e. income tax, corporation tax, commercial tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="549">The sales tax can be audited either by auditors or USt special auditors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">The BpO 2000 assumes three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">The audit is subject to all taxes to which a company has been charged.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit at large companies</seg>
<seg id="555">In accordance with the agreement, both courts of auditors did not examine individual cases. They looked into the question of how the financial administrations proceed in the USt audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="556">With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial administrations that is essential for the audit of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="557">What statistical records and evaluations for the USt testing of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">Are there statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between USt fraud control and general USt testing?</seg>
<seg id="560">CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat USt fraud and general USt audits.</seg>
<seg id="562">Are there statistics or records on the timeliness of the tests?</seg>
<seg id="563">CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected USt-mandators is recorded in the ATIS system;</seg>
<seg id="564">The same applies to information about the beginning and end of the examination of the FA.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the statistics for auditors summarised at federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.</seg>
<seg id="567">USt special auditors focus on the last USt investment periods and are also authorized to audit large companies.</seg>
<seg id="568">The federal statistics for USt special auditors do not contain any information on the size class of the audited company.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are statistics or records on the nature of the surplus result; e.g. B. subdivided by:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. real additional result (e.g. B. Application of a reduced rate instead of the general rate of VAT)</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. Incorrect surplus result (e.g. B. Relocation/shifting of a matter not objectionable under VAT law to another tax period)</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)</seg>
<seg id="573">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the additional tax result broken down by type of tax, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Irrespective of this, the amount of additional payments and the receipts of payments are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by type of tax. However, no distinction is made between tax liabilities arising from a tax return and those arising from the audit activities of the FA.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not differ according to the above-mentioned criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Nor did most financial authorities, where local surveys were carried out, differentiate in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="580">- Are there any fields of examination that are likely to yield results?</seg>
<seg id="581">CZ: Yes, the FA can select test cases based on criteria associated with selected key figures stored in the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="585">Accordingly, auditors and tax investigators of the countries have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold value is exceeded in ZAUBER.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. on the origin of the USt surplus result achieved.</seg>
<seg id="587">What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">CZ:</seg>
<seg id="589">- Large taxable companies have unlawfully used input tax deduction for purchased deliveries and services,</seg>
<seg id="590">- which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity in accordance with Section 72 (1) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="591">- which were used for representation expenses in accordance with Section 75 (3) CZ UStG;</seg>
<seg id="592">due to invoices that do not comply with the requirements of Section 73 (1) CZ UStG</seg>
<seg id="593">- Large taxable enterprises have omitted the registration of USt to be paid as provided for in Section 21 (1) CZ UStG.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="596">Findings on the USt from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, the Federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the database ZAUBER, into which auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="598">- Does the financial administration analyze areas of audit that are likely to yield results and draw consequences for strategic management?</seg>
<seg id="599">CZ: Yes, for example, nationwide tests are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not provide any information on particularly "energy-based" audit fields.</seg>
<seg id="602">With regard to the analysis of such information, the benefits and the way in which it is used further, there were different views among the survey bodies.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some senior financial directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but the FÄ is free to use it or not.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from USt audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss statements are processed in the system.</seg>
<seg id="606">CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases based on a wide range of information.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the evaluation and management of USt tests in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In the CZ, the establishment of a special finance office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="610">Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="611">The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.</seg>

<seg id="613">On the basis of the information in USt pre-registrations or USt declarations as well as test notices, qualified examiners select the cases to be examined and ensure the applicable taxation.</seg>
<seg id="614">Suitable management processes and risk management systems must be introduced in order to reduce revenue losses at the USt and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs.</seg>

<seg id="617">5. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation between the two audit institutions has proved its worth.</seg>
<seg id="619">In this way, necessary insights into the systems used in both countries could be gained: This applies in particular to: - intra-Community sales, - risk management at USt, in particular with regard to the selection of risky sales, - recovery of USt claims and - USt testing of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="620">The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting USt fraud and in the systems described above.</seg>
<seg id="621">These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="622">They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested parties on which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud. This applies, for example, to the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The experience and insights gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of the USt in the future.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Kommunique</seg>
<seg id="625">The report has been prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the Presidents of the Czech Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors.</seg>
<seg id="626">Status of information: June 2010.</seg>
