about how long these symptoms have been present?
and all chest pains should be treated in this way, especially given your age
and together with high temperature
and also need to check your cholesterol and blood pressure
and do you have a high temperature right now?
and are you experiencing this chest pain right now?
and besides, is it hard for you to breathe
and can you tell me what you have other symptoms other than these?
and how high was your temperature
and I also have a cough
and I have a little cold with cough
and I have really severe chest pain today
and does this time match the hay fever you are exposed to
and chest pain arises
and i think i got a bit of temperature
and I want you to describe what place of the chest you are in pain
and they also have a bit of high temperature
and with your history of diabetes
and you know it feels like my chest is going to be crushed
and you know people coughing at me all the time
and you are experiencing chest pain
and you said it was chest pressure
anyone in the family have heart problems, heart defeat, myocardial heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Any other symptoms or problems you have noticed and muscle pain related?
Do you have any other patients with the same symptoms at home?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you experiencing breath now?
Do you still experience chest pain
since it's flu season
but we should also not be left unattended because of chest pain that has cardiological nature
but now the more important problem is this chest pain
but my breath is hard
but i know a lot of people coughing at me
but we must approach the treatment of any chest pain with maximum seriousness
but you're breathing good right now, right?
since I don't remember this chest pain anymore
Does this look like someone is squeezing your chest
y'all still feel the breath

you experience something like this feeling of embarrassment in your chest
you know i have diabetes and all
you said you were experiencing this chest pain
COVID-19 apps are software applications for mobile phones designed to help in the epidemiological investigation in the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying faces ("contacts") who could contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been developed or proposed in some regions, officially supported by the authorities.
Several options have been developed for contact tracking applications.
This created a discussion on privacy issues, especially with regard to systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
The softer options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to register user's close to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join their efforts to integrate the functionality of supporting such applications through Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay has launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have interacted people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has open source and will be transferred to government control. North Macedonia has launched the StopKorona app working on Bluetooth, helping to track contacts with potentially infected people and providing prompt communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for registration on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said the contact tracking app is in the final stage of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an app with geozoning function, which is to ensure that patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, security professor, Cambridge University, indicates a number of potential practical problems that can arise with applications-based systems, including false work and potential inefficiency if the application is used only a small part of the population.
Given the concern about the spread of misleading or malicious " coronavirus " applications, Apple has restricted the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related applications in the App Store, including only " official " or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Participants of the privacy campaign expressed concern about the effects of mass observation of the population through coronavirus-related apps; in particular, the question of whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic when the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limitation of this type of oversight.
Organizations have announced eight conditions for state projects:
observation must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The expansion of monitoring and observation must be accompanied by reservations about limitation of the validity;
data use should be limited to the goals of combating the spread of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity must be protected and evidence of such security must be provided;
digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined at the level of legislation;
protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse should be guaranteed;
" meaningful participation " of all " relevant stakeholders ", including public health experts and marginalized groups should be ensured. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their list of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the constant surveillance problem, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems of their devices as soon as the need is gone.
In some countries instead of apps use network tracking location, which excludes the need to download the app and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to the original location data also have great potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location; a number of privacy systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see para. section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile devices and card tracking data, and then combined them to create text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
Not only did the government use this information to prevent citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but also made information on the location of public, which was made possible due to significant changes in the protection legislation that were made after the MERS outbreak in this country.
You can access this information through a number of apps and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and confidentiality systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
Tracking the contacts in which remains confidentiality is an established concept, a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013 As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups were working on confidentiality solutions, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register a user closer to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized confidentiality tracing (DP-PPT / DP-3 T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for identifiable personal data never leave the device and all comparisons occur on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform that keeps confidentiality while collecting and using location data or crossing paths to monitor COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research outlined in Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a confidentiality technology that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to allow users to exchange confidential information on location and health with other users and officials without putting the confidentiality of these data.
On April 2020, 5, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were founded by a global coalition of TCN, aimed at reducing fragmentation and global compatibility for tracking and alert, which is a key to their widespread.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it opened the source code BlueTrace used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts, which they claimed to provide confidentiality, which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to keep confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
deployment of tools to allow governments to create official applications to monitor the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but keeping confidentiality
Integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve constant surveillance problems, first introducing the system through operating system updates and then deleting it the same way after the threat disappearance.
Hand washing, also known as "hand hygiene" is the process of cleaning hands to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms or other malicious substances.
Regular hand washing with soap in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecally.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or ordinary cold, for example, if he touches the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous shells) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding, before eating, and after food or processing raw meat, fish and homemade birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleansed with the help of ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after treatments for care for a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing the baby who went to the toilet.
After a scratch, cough or sneezing.
After touching animals, food or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic actions related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases), as well as chemicals that may be malicious or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who do food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for everyone else.
Hand washing is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and also reduces infant mortality rate in domestic childbirth.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhea diseases can be reduced by learning simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50 %.
Regular reminders about the benefit of washing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to providing low-income regions with clean water.
Reducing the number of diarrhea cases by 48 % may be due to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ORZ), subject to the appropriate habits in every home, schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the main cause of mortality among children under the age of five, which brings about 1,8 million children a year.
Almost 3,5 million children die from diarrhea and pneumonia in general.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before eating and after a toilet that became a solid habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea mortality by almost half, and death from acute respiratory infections-for a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Hand washing also prevents the emergence of impetigo - a disease that is transmitted with direct physical contact.
A small negative effect of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to dry the skin, and consequently, damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that too frequent hand washing can lead to itching and skin whipping - a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis especially common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important for reducing the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptating (urination, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (change of diapers), before feeding the child before receiving food and before / after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of disease: before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, cough, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the procedure for washing hands with soap is quite a little common.
A study on hand washing in 2015 in 54 countries showed that on average for 38,7 % of families, soap washing is common practice. A 2014 study showed that the highest rate of 97 %, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US is closer to the middle, its 77 %; the lowest rate was recorded in China-23 %. Currently, there are several methods for changing behavior and developing a habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hand washing of school children at the set time of the day is one of the methodologies that helps to teach children to this procedure.
The "Emergency Medical Care Program" implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale measures to strengthen children's health and improve children's education.
This national program is based on deworming, which is held twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride.
The same program is successfully carried out in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from skin covers is more effective if soap or washing products are added in the washing process.
The main effect of soap and washing products is to eliminate barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective skin cleansing, as fats and protein components of organic pollution are poorly dissolved in water.
Enough water, however, contributes to the cleansing process.
Solid soap, due to reusable use, may also contain bacteria that may fall on it when used.
A small amount of research on getting into each bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggests a small probability of such a hit, as bacteria washed away with foam.
The CDC still claims that "hand dispenser liquid soap is the preferred option for hand washing".
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in communities caring for their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has an electoral effect on organisms that have antibiotic resistance.
However, antibacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match advertised.
In addition to the surface-active substance and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acetic acetic, ascorbic, milk) as a pH regulator, as well as anti-microbial active petrobial acid and other cuts (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis carried out by the Oregon School of Public Health showed that in terms of preventing diseases and removing bacteria from hand skin, simple soap is as effective as usual antibacterial soap containing triclosan.
Hot water comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, to remove natural fats that hold pollution and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to common opinion, scientific research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial burden on hands.
Hand disinfectant (sanitaiser) or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene tool that does not contain water.
In the late 1990 s and early 21th century, alcohol-free hand hygiene products (also known as alcohol disinfectants, antiseptic hand disinfection or sanitary).
Most of these products are made based on isopropylic alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickers, such as acrylic acrylic acrylic acrylic acid polymer, or moisturizer, such as liquid or foam glycerin, which ensure the convenience of using these products and reduces skin drying effect.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases anti-microbial activity. Disinfectants with at least 60-95 % of alcohol effectively destroy germs.
Disinfectants on alcohol-based kill bacteria, including multiple medicinal resistance bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, RSV, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70 % of alcohol kill 99,97 % of bacteria (3,5 reduction logarithm similar to 35 decrease) on hands 30 seconds after use and 99,99 %-99,999 % bacteria (logarithm 4-5) on hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Disinfectants on alcohol basis are almost ineffective against noroviral (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing products must be used to carefully process and sourn the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both palms, as well as the space between fingers throughout the length are wiped for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam or gel is completely absorbed.
Fingers on both hands should also be carefully rinsed. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing to hand washing rather than using disinfectants, especially if hands are heavily contaminated.
The increase in popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not serve as a replacement for full hand washing if there is possible to use water and soap.
Frequent use of alcohol disinfectants can cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain softening and (or) skin moisturizer.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other softening substances to the remedies.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing softening components caused significantly less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or supplements present in disinfectants do not occur.
A lower probability of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in favor of choosing disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free products do not cleanse their hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand disinfectants are not so effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms like ordinary soap and water, as pathogenic microorganisms still remain on hand.
The effectiveness of the disinfectant for the hands that does not contain alcohol depends largely on components and composition, and has been historically lower than alcohol or alcohol-containing.
More recently, it has been proven that drugs that use gas chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to lose efficiency after multiple use, probably due to progressive side skin reactions.
Many people in low income communities can't afford soap and replace it with angry or clay.
Evil or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or evil are contaminated by microorganisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, zola is a disinfectant, as when contact with water forms an alkaline solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends using zola or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infected, the US Center for Disease Control, it is recommended to use hand washing technique, including the following stages:
Put your hands under warm or cold water.
It is recommended that the water is recommended, because standing waters can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water doesn't matter.
Wash your hands, washing them with lots of soap, including the back side of the palms, as well as the areas between fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that when using soap (not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Hold your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Screening helps to remove germs from the skin, and the longer you third your hands, the more germs are removed.
Carefully strip your hands under the water.
Hands in standing water can provoke reinfected.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on their own.
Wet and wet hands are easier to get polluted. Most often, people leave areas such as thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and under their nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use moisturizing lotion to prevent hand skin drying, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottle pumpkin with holes and (or) use of ash, if necessary, for example, for example, in developing countries. There are water-saving solutions in areas (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), such as foot pedal taps and other inexpensive options.
A faucet with a foot pedal is a simple design consisting of a tank hanging on a rope and a knife lever that should be pressed to make water pour hands, while using a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but some disputes are being held over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Growing volume of research shows paper towels are much hygienic than electric hand dryers installed in many toilets.
A study sponsored by the European Symposium on paper napkins and towels was sponsored by Westminster University in London in 2008; the comparison of paper towels, hand dryer with warm air and more modern hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the finger pillows increases by 194 %, and on the palms of 254 %.
It also turned out that after washing and drying hands in the air flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pillows increases by 42 %, and on the palms - by 15 %.
After washing and drying hands with paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the finger pillows decreases to 76 %, and on the palms - up to 77 %. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors of toilet rooms and toilet environment with every type of drying.
A string air dryer that produces air at 180 m / s (650 mph, 400 mph) is capable of blowing microorganisms from hand and from its own block and potentially infect other users of the toilet room and bathroom within a radius of up to 2 meters.
Using warm air hand dryers distributes microorganisms within a radius of up to 0,25 meters from the dryer.
When using paper towels there was no significant distribution of microorganisms. In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study on assessing various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of drying hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers compare to dryer with paper towels.
Cleaning hands using disinfectant napkins can be an alternative solution when traveling without soap and water.
Disinfectant for hands on alcohol should contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignatz Zemmelweiss discovered his high efficiency (in 1846) in preventing diseases under stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices really helps to reduce infection levels.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each hand.
Hands should be carefully wiped at each other, crossing your fingers.
If there is dirt under your nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them with a dry clean towel.
After drying your hands, closing the faucet, as well as, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, a paper towel should be used.
This allows you to avoid re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of washing hands in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their spread.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing order remains unacceptable in most medical facilities: many doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus distribute microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic treatments can reduce the level of blood flow infections by 66 %. The World Health Organization published a leaflet of standard hand washing and handling to be applied in the health sector.
The WHO draft manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby co-author.
If you need to confirm compliance with regulatory requirements, commercial devices can be used for measuring indicators and hand hygiene verification.
The World Health Organization means "five moments" when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological liquids,
before using antiseptic and also
after patient care treatments. Adding antiseptic chemicals to hand washing soap (" medical " or " antimicrobial " soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgical operations or in an environment with high antibiotic-resistant organisms. To "clean" hands before surgery requires a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching it with your hands; a little chlorohexidine or iodine or iodine water should also be used for hand-washing sterile hand drying towels, sterile friction and other sterile tool for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry must be taken off.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to elbow usually within 2-6 minutes.
No need to wipe your hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During the rinse, the water from the forearm should not fall back on the hand brush.
After the washing is completed, the hands dry with sterile fabric and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after care for a sick person.
To combat staphilococc infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 % of washing is the first 20 % of washing, and that very few additional benefits were received when hand washing rate was increased by more than 35 %.
Compared to washing antibacterial soap, washing with ordinary soap leads to more than triple increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparison of hand washing with alcohol and hand washing with antibacterial soap, on average of 30 seconds each procedure, showed that handling with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial pollution by 26 % compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol solutions for hands, in terms of reducing the amount of the A H1N1 flu virus and the clostridium difficile dispute. Hand hygiene activities in medical facilities may include training of hand washing staff, improving the availability of alcohol-containing hand-containing solutions, as well as written and oral reminders to staff about the need to wash their hands.
Additional research is needed on the most effective measures in various medical facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or hand washing in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to vaccinate the habit of washing your hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are far from every private or public toilet, hand washing cranes, although there are cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by rooted habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Propaganda and stimulating hand washing with soap can affect political decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate results.
Systematic analysis of 70 studies found that to improve the health situation of hand hygiene in countries with income countries, health, health care at the community level, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of propaganda about hand washing in schools is the approach of the United Nations Children's Fund "Three Star Approach": it promotes simple economic measures in schools that stimulate hand washing students using soap, as well as other hygienic requirements.
By enforcing minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
Installation of handwashers is one of the possible measures implemented in the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene to reduce the incidence and infant mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emoji that symbolize hand washing.
Some studies discussed the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health - especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and "founder of modern care".
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasms.
In the 1980 s, due to the outbreaks of digestive tract and medical care infections, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of pork flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better understanding how important it is to wash their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, there were posters with " proper hand washing technicians in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing your hands" means showing your reluctant to accept responsibility for anything or to be a participant of anything.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew's Gospel: Pontius Pilate "washed hands" when making a decision to crucifixion Jesus Christ; this phrase later gained wider use in some English communities.
In the play " Macbeth " Shakespeare " Lady McBeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to clear the imaginary spot symbolizes an unclean conscience for the crimes she committed and prompted her husband.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than other people, and they are more important for them.
It is also less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after what they saw will participate in any other "cleansing" compensating activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions, hand washing has both hygienic purpose and symbolic importance. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided in many religions, including Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe mandatory hand washing after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after every meal.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: at the moment in China and other countries More than 3 people died in the world, and the number of infected has exceeded 80
Like the homological SARS-Cov virus that caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severity of the disease and lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and strikes older people more often than young, and men are more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications about the new disease, this article offers a relevant and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnostics, treatment, forecast of further current and prevention of this disease.
While many questions are still to be found, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate dangerous disease.
Spring celebration (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who have urged to the outbreak of a new viral infection to stay home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after him.
Given the high level of similarity with cov (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus SARS-CoV-2, 11, and the accompanying disease is a coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread across the country, and then almost 50 other countries around the world.
According to the data of March 2020, 2, more than 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40 patients were recovered, more than 3 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "number one enemy to society" and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 publications about COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting from the first report of January 7, 2020 a year in which defined the sequence of the virus, allocated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize research results in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other coronavirus disease - the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012
We will also discuss the facts about the prevention and prediction of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronavirus has traditionally been among pathogens that are not deadly dangerous to human beings and mostly cause approximately 15 % of total respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have twice faced high-pathogenic coronavirus of human, that is, the coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) that caused the outbreak of diseases initially in China In 2003 and Saudi Arabia, respectively and soon spread to many other States with a terrible rate of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in the figure. Figure 1.1, a report on clusters of unknown origin pneumonia came to the National Health Commission of China from the city. Wuhan December 31, 2019
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case in the city was registered. Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread quickly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of medical workers, which allowed to suggest the possibility of transmission of the virus from a person.
January 23 in the city Wuhan has been introduced quarantine, stopped working in public transport.
On January 24, according to the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contacts with the seafood market in the city. Wuhan, who was considered the starting point of spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus is a global public health emergency.
At the time of preparing this report, the disease has spread across China and has already infiltrated about 50 other countries worldwide (figure 50). (Figure 2). 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and the extent of the danger of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, the results of a multi-center clinical study, which attended by 8 patients, including 4 patients with COVID-19, the following updated development picture was presented epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
All age groups have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but mostly people between the ages of 30 to 65 years old.
Almost half (47,7 %) of those who were older than 50 years old, very few under 20, and only 14 infected were not yet 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0,31/100) than among women (0,27/100).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mostly in Hubei province and in nearby regions.
On average, from the moment of COVID-19 symptoms, it took place 5 (2-9) days before the diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4,8 (3,0-7,2) days.
From the moment of symptoms to death, the average, there were 9,5 (4,8-13) days.
Reproduction base (R0) was 3,77 (95 % CI: 3,51-4,05), and the adjusted R0 was 2,23-4,82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, coincided with large-scale transport on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
The deaths among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1,44 % (95 % CI: 1,10-1,86 %) and the adjusted mortality rate among patients is 3,06 % (95 % CI: 2,02-4,59 %).
The three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 were: sex (male), age (₹ 60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronavirus is a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one thread of meaning RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and betacoronavirus are known to amaze people.
In case of defeat SARS and MERS, glycoprotein of shell thorns (S) is linked to cell receptors of angiotenzin-type 2-type 2 enzyme and dipeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, after which the membrane synthesis occurs.
Cytoplasma is released by the viral RNA genome; after replication of the viral genomic RNA, along with shell glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the membrane cell, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence appeared on January 10, 2020
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, which is 99,98 % coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first hearth of the disease outbreak in the Juanan seafood market in the city. Wuhan.
Genetically SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-Cov than MERS-Cov.
SARS-CoV-2 particle enlightening electronic microscopy were found in ultra-thin cuts of human breathing epithelium.
It is found that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-Cov.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 connects to the ACE2 enzyme than in the case of SARS-CoV, explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients less severity than SARS-Cov.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-living protein, orf3b coded, and classified protein encoded orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 protein protein can play some role in terms of the virus pathogenic and suppress the IFN☀️; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, a group of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the full-size ACE2 enzyme structure with a resolution of 2,9 ☀️ in a complex with a B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can link two S-proteins, which serves as evidence for coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-Cov-2. infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to a person through civites and camels, respectively.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-Cov-2 with other coronavirus, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, as the new virus is 96 % identical to two similar to SARS coronavirus, namely coronavirus SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what species became an intermediate owner, through which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect the person; the path of transmission also remains to be found.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and colleagues suggested that snake-person were snakes from bats from bats, during which occurred homological recombination in S-protein.
According to the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins - long-term mammammals who eat ants and often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on 99 percent genetic resemblance between coronavirus pangolins and SARS-Cov-2.
However, the 1 % difference between both genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with specific evidence has not yet been obtained (figure. (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown for the most part.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV laboratory conditions can survive for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20°C and 40-50 % humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56°C for 30 minutes; effective block the virus activity can be broadcast, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, hairdressing acid, chloroforms and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorohexidine.
The human population in general does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
Currently there is no data on detailed research on immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier research on other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure. (Figure 4). 4).
As a rule, the virus first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognizing receptors (ORR), including S-type lectors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes inflammation factors, maturity of dendrity and type I interferon synthesis that contain the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophagocytosis against viral antigens.
However, thanks to N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid immune reaction.
Soon, an adaptive immune reaction will be included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ T-cells and CD8 +, play an important role in protecting the body.
T-CD4+ cells stimulate the generating virus-specific antibodies in B-cells, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill the virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines helping protective cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit T-cells functions, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, the antibodies that are allocated from a healed patient, have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, hyperreaction of the immune system entails local education of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario, lead to polyorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to amaze older people with accompanying pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for people who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or have immune system violations.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in the city. Wuhan, the estimated average SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is between 1 to 14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, the study of 1 cases showed that the incubation period lasted on average of 3 days, with the scattered between 0 to 24 days.
A later study described above, based on the demography data of 8 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4,8 (3,0-7,2) days.
It is very important for the health authorities to adjust the quarantine measures to adjust the quarantine measures to the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease is asymptomatically.
A common practice was a 14-day quarantine for people who had contact with the virus or virus infected.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, nose, chest pain, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have a week after the beginning of the disease, there were shortness of breath and (or) hypoxia.
In severe cases, the disease has progressed quickly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
High temperature patients and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even when there are no pathologies in chest pictures.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 found the following symptoms prevalence rates: 98 % high temperature, 76 % dry cough, 55 % breath, and 3 % diarrhea; 8 % of patients required artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from the last two studies of family infections and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in a study of MERS-CoV patients who also had high temperature (98 %) dry cough (47 %) and shortness (55 %).
However, 80 % of them required artificial lung ventilation, this indicator is much higher than among COVID-19 patients, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
MERS patients also observed diarrhea (26 %) and throat pain (21 %).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99-100 %) dry cough (29-75 %) breath (40-42 %) diarrhea (20-25 %) and throat pain (13-25 %) and artificial lung ventilation requires 14-20 % of patients.
As of February 14, the death from COVID-19 was 2 % and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66
In comparison with this SARS mortality rate by November 2002 was 10 % of 8 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, the demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed 37 % of 2 confirmed cases.
According to an earlier study, the base rate of reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was identified at 6,47 at 95 % trust interval (CI) within 5,71-7,23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the interval only 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-Cov and SARA-Cov on symptoms, mortality rate and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show the higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infected with a new virus is lower than the last two.
Thus, it will be much harder to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov epidemic.
Cluster manifestation often occurs when infected within one family or a group of people who come together for any reason or were together on a transport, for example on a cruise liner.
Patients often went to the city. Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted with infected or patients for the last two weeks before the disease began.
However, according to the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, after discharged from the hospital, can again become the virus, and this is an alarming signal to the quarantine extension of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1 patients with COVID-19 have been installed lymphopenia with leukocyte level
In the blood of some patients found increased levels of liver, muscle enzymes and myoglobin, and most patients observed increased levels of C-jet protein and blood erythrocytes.
Patients with a severe disease, D-dimer, the decay product of fibrin the blood has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has constantly decreased.
Most patients with COVID-19, during X-rays of the chest-ray, have found pathologies characterized by uneven eclipses on both sides or "matte glass" in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ORZ).
In the development of the ORZ, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.
Type I and II pneumocytes dysfunction reduces surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing lungs ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray study often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes and interfabric lymphocytic infiltration, and multi-nuclear syncitial cells in lung patients who died from the disease correspond to viral infection and the same as found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19, the method of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 was used through a polymer chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false negative results that can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, China began to diagnosis based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying exclusively on PCR with reverse transcript).
The same was the situation with SARS diagnosis.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray research results.
On February 14, 2020, a group of specialists under the leadership of Mr. Feng Zhang, described the protocol of the application of the SHERLOCK based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows to identify synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 with a density of 20 × 10-18 mol to 200 × 10-18 mol (10-100 copies per microliter of the original sample) with indicator stripes in less than an hour without use complex equipment.
This new method, if it successfully passes clinical testing, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and convenience of conducting them.
Due to lack of experience in countering previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide patients with COVID-19 only supporting therapy while trying to use any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (table (Table 2). 2).
These therapeutic methods include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressors, steroids, plasma of healed patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of healed patients were offered to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks mostly lungs, and perhaps less affected by other ACE2 organs, such as gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
Nevertheless, breach of work and respiratory organs are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, respiratory function support, including common oxygen, high oxygen, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical lung ventilation, which are assigned depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of an extracorporal Oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapulmonal circulation used to treat the life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of water-salt balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protecting vital organs is essential for patients with SARS-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to be a result of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS virus.
The cytokine storm is a form of a system inflammatory process developing in response to the allocation of cytokins, including TNFa, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNa, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokins provoke immunocites to release a huge number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of the ODS and polyorgan failure.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially patients in severe condition, immunity is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab were used to treat cytokine storm, monoclone antibodies serving as an interleukin inhibitor-6.
Other methods of treating cytokine storm based on immunity suppression include modulation of immune response to control T-cells; the blockade of cytokins IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of janus-kinases; application of pancake, suppressors cytokine signals 4 and histondeacetalasis inhibitors.
steroids are widely used as immunity suppressors to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses.
However, steroids in large doses do not benefit in treating severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly deteriorate the forecast.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium dosage are recommended to be used with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of drafting this document, there is no confirmed effective anti-viral therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of remdesivir, nucleotide analog, proved to be an effective treatment of an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola virus and the Marburg virus.
Later, the remdesivir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses from single-chain RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this medicine to China to conduct couple research on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results of these studies are looking forward to it.
In addition, baricitinib, a-interferon, lopinavir / rinavir and ribavirin were offered as possible options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir / rhea can be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver defeat and other side actions.
The interaction of these drugs with other medicines prescribed patients should be careful.
Plasma of healed patients and antibodies development
Blood harvest from patients who are treated from contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy population has been used for a long time.
Indeed, the blood of healed patients often contain relatively high antibodies to combat pathogen.
Antibodies are in immunoglobulin, produced by B-lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogens molecules and address them.
Based on this prerequisite, plasma was allocated from blood samples of COVID-19 patients, which was then introduced to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral load decreased, and oxygen satuation has increased.
However, in order to propose a mass use of this method before specific therapy, it is required not yet verification or explanations.
In addition, some plasma shortcomings should be carefully examined in mind the therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emissions syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential life-threatening.
Concentration of blood antibodies is usually low, and plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It's not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to overcome the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to allocate the B-cells of healed patients and identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or screening to find effective antibodies against critical virus proteins.
This is how we can immediately move to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for millennia to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as highlighting and verifying these components or their optimal combination seems difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treatment for patients with light and medium-to the severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found effective in COVID-19.
The largest proportion of COVID-19 patients was noted in a number of China's provinces, which used Chinese traditional medicine in the treatment of 87 % of patients, including Gansu (63,7 %) Ningxia (50 %) and Hunan (50 %) while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used only about 30 % of patients with COVID-19, the lowest proportion of recovered (13 %).
However, this is a rather rude comparison, as the assessment should be carried out with many other influence factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On February 2020, 18, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study that comparison of treatment solely on Western medicine and combined treatment methods of Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the deadlines of normalization of body temperature, eliminating symptoms and medical care in the hospital conditions were significantly fewer patients who used a combination of methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than patients who were treated only in Western methods.
The most amazing is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to deteriorate symptoms (from light to heavy) was noticeably lower in the group treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in a group that was treated only by Western methods (7,4 % compared to 46,2 %) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8,8 % compared to 39 %).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled research, more and more regions.
A certain interest is also obtaining, if possible, describing the mechanism of action and explaining aspects of the effectiveness of components used in Chinese traditional medicine methods.
Patients who suspect or confirmed the presence of COVID-19 are mostly afraid of an acute and even deadly disease, and people closed on quarantine are also bored, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid insomnia, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
Early stages of the outbreak of SARS virus reported manifestations of a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arotic symptoms, deliria, and even suicidal behavior.
The compulsory tracking of contacts and quarantine, among the measures taken by the health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic can increase people's anxiety and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and contact with them, and all other people who need it.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric care teams should be formed, clear information with regular and accurate update on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role to interrupt the transmission chain of infection and infected people to susceptible owners and often apply in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been carried out to create S-protein vaccines, aimed at developing long-living and highly active anti-body neutralizing and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
During animal research, living weakened vaccines from SARS virus were developed.
However, before clinical studies, it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when they are used in age patients, a model of infected with deadly doses, and the degree of protection against zoonous viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and hasn't reported any new case since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of the MERS virus, emerging in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the preservation of zoonous sources in endemic habitats.
To combat MERS, vaccination strategies were developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral particles and recombine protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long term (on average of 18 months) necessary for the development of vaccine and the dynamic change of coronavirus.
As an earlier unknown disease, COVID-19 is just starting to show a full picture of the clinical flow of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients manage to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also related to the high rate of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to formulate a predictive model of the disease in order to prioritize their measures, especially in areas where there are lack of resources.
Based on clinical studies submitted to date, the following factors may affect the prediction of the disease in patients with COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor in predicting the disease caused by the SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mostly strikes patients between the ages of 30 to 65, 47,7 % of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have initial diseases and complications, and were much older than those patients who did not require such therapy (on average 66 years vs. 51 years), which indicates in favor of that that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0,31/100 vs. 0,27/100) as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are higher probability of developing acute damage to myocardial and arrhythmia.
Cardiological phenomena were also the main cause of death of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also relate to ACE2-positive holangiocytes, which could cause liver breach in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and initial diseases are closely interconnected and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory research: the level of C-jet protein in the blood reflects the extent of inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor in the flow of the disease, reaction to therapy and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the level of C-jet protein, the degree of severity of the disease and the forecast under COVID-19.
In addition, the result can also predict the increased level of lactatdehydrogenase, asparagin-aminotransfers, alanin-aminotransfers and creatinases.
These enzymes in large quantities stand out by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs in case of tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditionally cardiac or liver dysfunction markers.
The main clinical symptoms: to predict results and complications in COVID-19 treatment, along with other factors, you should take into account the data of chest X-ray research and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
Using steroids: as described above, steroids are immunity suppressors widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
As corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the disease have developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused life disability and low quality of life.
Thus, in case of steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small dosage and short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with high uncertainty and watch the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve stress from such patients and help them get back to normal life, psychological consultations and long-term support.
According to the demographic research conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic seems to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tracks, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronavirus that cause common cold diseases, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory ways and cause weak symptoms or not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients with early illness or are not over the incubation period can, while leading their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, which significantly makes epidemiological control.
However, it was believed that the SARS-Cov virus was believed to happen when patients are seriously ill, while in most cases, there was no early infection.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is harder to control.
Currently, there is a lot of work in China, which the universal quarantine is announced in the city. Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the quarantine regime has been extended for almost the entire population, introduced to interrupt the SARS-CoV-2. virus.
While these measures are doing great harm to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients identified is decreasing, indicating the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic calculations, the outbreak of the disease will end by March, and the phase of extinguishing will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020
Researchers from the group led by Ira Longini, have made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could hit two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nose and throat, taken from patients recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus can become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently being used may have had an effect.
According to the original predictions, Ebola fever should have struck up to a million people and caused half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to take control.
There is a chance that, like the SARS-CoV virus, infecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus can weaken, and over time it will disappear or transform into a less pathogenic virus that coexist with a person.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic (figure. (Fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by high speed through cough or sneezing, and perhaps through direct contact with the virus contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in kale, meaning that it is also possible and orally-fecal method of transmission.
According to one of the latest research, 41 % of the cases out of the 138 researchers may have resulted from hospital infection, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical staff.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders who contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing facial masks; both surgical masks and respirators of class N95 (series No. 1860 s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent microdrops of liquid from potentially infected to fly in the air and settle on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860 s) can protect from inhaling virions from 10 to 80 nm, they miss only 5 % of virions; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size, like SARS-CoV and they are both about 85 nm.
As particles can even penetrate through five surgical masks folded together, medical workers directly contact with patients must wear N95 masks (series No. 1860 s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical workers should wear a protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also fall into the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor infected SARS-CoV-2, despite wearing a N95 class mask; perhaps the virus hit his body through inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, medical workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type protective glasses.
All potentially threatened or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands with disinfectants more often, try not to leave the house, and restrict contacts with potentially infected people.
The distance to the patient is considered to be the distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to humanity, the high level of its similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 2020, 7, was supposed to be an alarming signal for China, taking in attention experience gained by him during the SARS outbreak in 2003
However, only after January 19, 2020, the Director of the Center for Disease Control in the city. Wuhan calmed the citizens by saying that the new virus has low contagiveness and limited reproductivity when transmission from person to person and that preventing the spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tensions, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Chinese New Year celebration, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be held within the city. Wuhan with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitude and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information from clinics, and do not wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain the potential epidemic at the early stages of its development, rather than to calm the public; and (4) to conduct targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness on epidemic diseases and regular inspection and improvement of society response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the previously unstudied coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019
In less than two months, the disease covered all China and at the time of drafting this document was distributed in 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19, the SARS relapse.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of controlling the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 strikes older people more than young people and men in more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rate among older people is also higher than among young people.
SARS mortality is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10,91 % compared to 1,44 %).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even with an asymptomatic disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of diseases, so it is harder to hold the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and larger than SARS-Cov.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples for SARS-CoV-2. RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients can show positive samples on the virus again.
All of this significantly increases the risk of virus spread.
Against the background of such rapid promotion of COVID-19 research, some important issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the detection of a 96 percent homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronavirus, we still can't claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.
What animal has become an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original owner, for example from bats, to human?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission, and the epidemiological situation can exacerbate at any moment.
Molecular modeling and biochemical samples showed that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus be introduced into respiratory cells and provokes subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also relate to ACE2 cells in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of transmission from person to person?
Will it cause the world pandemic, will it disappear as SARS or will periodically relapse like flu?
These aspects are of priority, but it will take time to find answers to these and many more questions.
However, we have no choice but whatever it takes to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it does not expect the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be received earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five candidates for vaccines underwent research on stage I safety.
The COVID-19 virus was discovered in December 2019
In 2020, a major outbreak of this disease spread worldwide, leading to significant investment in the development of vaccine and research activities.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2
As announced in April, the key challenges of the CEPI initiative to develop vaccines are to provide the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technological platforms for creating an effective COVID-19. vaccine.
Some of the main goals of the platform included in Phase I safety research:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and drug-candidate for vaccine: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and drug candidate for vaccine: CanSino Biology, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 more vaccines were announced-candidates, but there are little public information (presumably under planning or development).
In stages I-II, preliminary safety and immunogenity testing is usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and at several sites, with simultaneous definition of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the test usually covers more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for disease prevention, while at the same time tracking side effects at optimal dosage.
Out of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not been tested (still under pre-clinical research).
On January 2020, 24, Queensland University, Australia, announced that it is exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral protein to stimulation of immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced its own vaccine to start testing in 2021
The beginning of vaccine development projects were also announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020 and the University of Hong Kong - January 28
On January 29, 2020, Jansen pharmaceutical companies led by Hannek Shuitmaker, announced that they start working on the creation of their vaccine.
Jansen, together with his biotechnology partner Vaxart is developing a peroral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine on technology similar to the one used for cancer vaccination against neo-antigen.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of work on vaccine synthesis and the beginning of trials.
On February 27, 2020, Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it is starting a project for developing a peptide vaccine II-Key vs COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a drug candidate for a vaccine that could be tested on people in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Research, Fort Detrick, and Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, which is located in the western Maryland, announced that they are developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that she had partnered with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of vaccine.
Partners have also announced plans to conduct pre-clinical trials and phase I clinical test by July 2020
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are studying 11 isolated patients, and that it would take at least two years and a half to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company, Quebec, reported that a partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research, they created a piece like coronavirus.
Potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, and people testing is scheduled for July or August 2020
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "big money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government expressed his protest.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German BioNTech for joint development of the IRNA vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for the IRNA vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing pre-clinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it will receive pre-clinical trials and their final drug candidate for vaccine can start testing on people in the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation for Epidemics (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $ 4,9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine development consortium with the participation of Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. The total investment of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is $ 29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in developing the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian officials in the field of healthcare announced that scientists have begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers of Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine from COVID-19.
The drug candidate for the vaccine was developed within 14 days after receiving a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced $ 275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine candidates for Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and Saskatchewan University.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced $ 192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to create a national "vaccine bank", which will include several new vaccines that could be used in case of a new outbreak of coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine on mice, saying that "MNA introduced subunit vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, causing strong antigen-specific antibodies [ at mice ] that showed up 2 weeks after immunization".
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that might be released in the form of a nazal spray.
With the help of bacteriophagus, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and create harmless viruses that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-CoV-Cov-2. virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three US universities combined IBM supercomputers resources combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other advantages in addition to disease prevention properties.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4170 health workers.
Perhaps the vaccines developed will be unsafe or ineffective.
Early research on the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for deterrent 3 biosafety measures in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination of ensuring standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccine for SARS treatment that would be safe and effective for people.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for atypical pical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health institutions worldwide. There is no proven vaccine against MERS either.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that SARS study at the time, could be the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutic tools against MERS-Cov infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that passed phase I of clinical trials on people, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector vaccines and were in the process of development, two adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one - MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The conspiracy theory was spread on social media, which claimed that the COVID-19 virus is not new, and that the vaccine already exists.
Social media publications quoted the words of some patients who claimed that patents for genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the external surface (cellular membranes) cells in lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the relevant angiotenzine-transforming enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotenzine-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution to treat cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often mentioned as hACE2.
Angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 is a zinc metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains N-end peptidase domain M2 and C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid collection.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane of type I, its fermentatively active domain hits the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
ACE2's extracellular domain is deviated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as the stadase, and the obtained soluble protein is released into the blood and eventually comes out with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar cells of the lung type II, subtle intestines, arterial and venous endothelial cells and cells of smooth muscles of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 iRNA is also found in brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain barrel.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight of ACE.
ACE spreads angiotenzin I hormone into vascular angiotenzine II.
ACE2, in turn, snifies carboxic end amino acid phenylalanine from Angiotenzine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Phe) and hydrolizes it into vasodilatatory angiotenzin (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also split a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotenzin, Dynorphin A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transport and is present for Hartnoup disease.
As a transmebran protein, ACE2 serves as the main point of entry point for some coronavirus, including HCov-NL63; SARS-Cov (SARS-CoV-2 virus); and SARS-2 (COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, S1 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 protein with ACE2 fermentative domain on the surface of the cells leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and endosomes inside the cells.
This entry process also requires prime protein S serine protein TMPRSS2 carrier protein, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to the thought that reducing ACE2 levels in cages can help in the fight against infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to the systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 2012, 11, "the use of APF inhibitors was due to a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 % compared to the control group".
Moreover, " the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients who received APF inhibitors who were at higher risk by pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with reducing pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than patients with common risk of pneumonia ".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is an innovation in therapy with acute lung damage and apparently improves pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory failure caused by lipopolipopolysugar.
The rhACE2 half-output period in people is about 10 hours, and the start of the action is 30 minutes, in addition to the impact of 24 hours.
Some data indicates that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with intolerant classical inhibitors of the Renin-angiotenzine system (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases that have increased circulate angiotenzin II. RhACE2 introduced was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of acute respiratory disstress syndrome.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 This is the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on January 2020, 30, an international public health emergency was announced, which was later recognized as a pandemic on March 2020.
As of April 2020, 10, approximately 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 were registered in 210 countries and regions, which killed approximately 97 people.
About 364 people have recovered.
China's mortality rate is 4 %, while it ranges from 13,04 % in Algeria to 0,08 % in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficult breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
From the first symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
Basic treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, cough mouth cover, keeping distance between people, identifying and self-isolation of people suspecting their infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by introducing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfew, workplace risk control and closing various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic implications, transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a widespread shortage of goods aggravated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have been closed nationwide or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99,4 % of students worldwide.
The Internet has begun to spread misinformation about the virus, xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who resemble them, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus spread.
As a result of the reduction in the number of travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions has decreased.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province), China, reported that pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation into the situation began in early January 2020
The cases of infections were mostly related to the wholesale market of Juanan seafood, so the virus is believed to have zoonous origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. This is a recently open virus that has a great resemblance to coronavirus, coronavirus, and SARS-Cov. It was later found that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of infections recorded in December 2019 were relevant to this market.
On March 13, 2020, the publication of the Southern Chinese branch of the newspaper "Morning Post", which was not verified, it was suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019 years. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infections in China has decreased, but it was unexpectedly growing in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly lower, in particular, due to many cases with weak symptoms.
By February 26, there were relatively few cases of infections among young people, with patients who are 19 years old and under 2,4 % of cases worldwide. Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom Patrick Wallance estimated that 60 % of the British population will be infected before the time of effective group immunity is formed in the country's population.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who were tested on COVID-19, and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has been able to verify more than 3 % of its population, and in many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have been adopted an official policy that prescribing not to test only minor symptoms.
A study published on March 16 showed that in China until January 23, 86 % of COVID-19 cases were found, and that such unregistered patients have become a source of infection for 79 % of registered cases.
Statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of actual infections in Italy has largely exceeded the number of cases recorded.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infection (R0) on COVID-19 were from 1,4 to 2,4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this indicator could be 5,7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are safely recovering.
In other, more complex cases, the beginning of symptoms to death ranged between 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period of 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80 % of fatal cases were over 60, and 75 % of those who died had related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official mortality data from the COVID-19 pandemic usually includes information about the deaths of patients with positive results of COVID testing, which was performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official numbers may not take into account of dead people who have not tested - for example, in the case of death at home, nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data on Italy shows that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID by 4-5 times.
The US Spokesperson of the CDC Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes: "We know that [ claimed number of dead ] is below the actual". His words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the United States. Such incomplete data accounting is often found in pandemic such as the H1N1 pork flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was registered in Wuhan on January 9, 2020
The first death outside of mainland China was registered on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside of Asia in France on February 14
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths were registered outside of mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents, except Antarctic, reported deaths. Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and the time of disease; they are also affected by testing, quality of health systems, treatment schemes, time since the outbreak outbreak and population, such as age, gender and general health. The "mortality / morbidity" rate represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnostic cases of infection during the given time interval.
According to Jones Hopkins University statistics, as of April 2020, 10, the global number of deaths and infections is 6,0 % (97).
Data in different regions differ.
In China, the mortality ratio of morbidity decreased from 17,3 % (for those with symptoms on January 1-10, 2020) to 0,7 % (for those with symptoms appeared after February 1, 2020 years). Other methods include determining the mortality rate of the disease (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the infections (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not attached to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators on specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Evidence Center estimates that the mortality rate of this pandemic is between 0,1 to 0,39 %.
The top digit of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary testing on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
Peak and exact duration of the flash are not defined and may vary depending on location.
Matei Bonnie, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that " uncontrollable infectious outbreaks tend to go on the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease starts to extinguish.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when it will happen ".
Senior Medical Advisor of the Chinese government, Jun Nanshan claims that "it can end by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations to stop the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "would circulate maybe for a year or two".
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neal Ferguson, "until the vaccine is created ( maybe 18 months or more )", physical distance measures and other measures will be required.
William Shaffner, Vanderbilt University, says: " I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear forever, because it is so easily transmitted ", and that it " can " can turn into a seasonal disease, flash every year ".
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific, and some infected people can endure the disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are high temperature (88 %) and dry cough (68 %).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the formation of the airway (mucus), loss of smell, shortness, muscle and joint pain, headache, headache, chills, vomiting, blood, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims to be sick in serious shape with the development of respiratory problems about every sixth person.
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as breathing, constant pain, or chest pain, a sudden sense of consciousness confusion, difficulty awakening and lip. In case of these symptoms, you should immediately seek medical attention. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people infected people may be asymptomatically, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that people who are in close contact with patients who are confirmed, under strict control and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic flow of the disease ranges from several units to 44 % of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. While there is no complete clarity on the symptoms of loss of smell: the initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was originally 30 %, and then fell to 15 %.
Some details on ways to spread the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mostly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops that stand out into the air along with cough, sneeze or during conversation; close contact means contact is between 1 to 2 meters (from 3 meters (from 3 up to 6 ft).
According to some research, drops can spread from 4,5 meters (15 ft) to 8,2 meters (27 ft).
There are assumptions that the virus may also be transmitted through small drops thrown into the air during conversation that are able to stay in the air for a longer time. Respiratory drops can also be formed when exhale, including during the conversation, although the virus usually does not be carried through the air.
Drops can fall into the mouth or nose of people around, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical treatments, such as intubation and heart-pulmonary ICU (SLR), can lead to spraying out of exhalation and therefore, the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches the contaminated surface, including skin, with a further touch of their eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of SARS-CoV-2. fecal transmission is most contagious within the first three days of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before symptoms and later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests were positive in testing three days before symptoms appeared, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus before the pronounced symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but research on contact tracking in some countries also found cases of transmission from asymptomic carriers.
Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not quite clear how easily the virus is spread, it is known that one patient usually infected by 2-3 others. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304) the virus is able to live up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on copper surfaces up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals received a positive result on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although British authorities advise washing their hands after contact with animals, just like, for example, after contact with other surfaces that infected people could touch.
Heavy sharp respiratory coronavirus syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first found in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in the relatives of coronavirus. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed using domestic soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a great resemblance to the original SARS-Cov virus.
It is supposed to have a zoonosis origin.
The genetic analysis of coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with Betacoronavirus, a subgenecovirus (cellular line B) together with two other strains of bats of bats.
At a holistic and genomic level, it is 96 % identical to other samples of the coronavirus of the bat (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids of certain parts of sequences of pangolin and human virus sequences.
A holistic-genomic comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarities (92 %) is between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate owners of the virus.
Virus infected can be pre-diagnosed with symptoms, although it should eventually be confirmed by analyzing polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions match other pneumonia and diseases.
Since March 2020, American College of Radiology published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnosis".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2, and the first one was published on January 17
Real-time polymeric chain reaction is being tested (RT-PCR).
It can be carried out on respiratory samples and blood samples.
Results are usually ready within a few hours to a few days.
Usually, a nasal dab is used for the test, although the zeva can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to identify antibodies.
As of April 2020, 6, none of them have been accurate enough to receive approval for widespread use.
In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features of visualization of symptoms on X-ray and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral spreadings by matte glass and no pleval outlets.
The Italian Radiological Society is preparing an international base of photos of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to similar to other infections, such as adenovirus, when identification of COVID-19, not confirmed by PCR tests, have limited clinical specifics.
A major study was conducted in China, which compared the results of the chest and PCR testing, and it was found that, although the shots are less specific in the case of infection, they can be transcripted faster; they are more sensitive, and therefore this one diagnostics method can be seen as a screening tool in infected areas.
To diagnose the virus using X-ray and computer tomography, neural neural networks were developed based on artificial intelligence.
Strategies for preventing disease transmission include maintaining common personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding eye touch, nose or mouth with dirty hands, cough or sneezing napkins that should be thrown out immediately after use.
Those who may have already been infected should wear a medical mask in people's places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance yourself from people. Many governments recommend refrain from any non-term trips to countries and areas affected by flash and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among the population, some members of which do not know where and how they were infected. Medical workers who care for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with other people and eye protection. Tracking contacts is also an important method used by the health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent it from further spread.
Government s' use of data on the whereabouts of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concern about confidentiality and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International), as well as more than 100 other organizations, made statements requiring to limit this type observation of people.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use were developed and proposed; as of April 2020, 7, more than a dozen expert groups worked on developing solutions that ensure personal data confidentiality - for example, registration of user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he gets a notification. There are also baseless versions on how to prevent infected - for example, nose and mouth that is actually ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine at the moment, although many organizations are working to create it.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash hands.
The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing your hands with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with heavy hand pollution, as well as before eating, after a swelling, cough or sneezing.
This is necessary, because, while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap that opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using disinfectant hands on alcohol treatment with alcohol content of at least 60 %.
WHO recommends people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (the stainless steel surface is starting to operate a minute after application) with 62-71 % ethanol, 50-100 % isopropanol, 0,1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0,5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0,2-7,5 % of povidon yodine.
Other components such as gasalconia chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if COVID is suspected or confirmation of an institution such as an office or a day hospital, all spaces of such space, including cabinets, toilets, public premises, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote remote control and ATMs used by sick people have been disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend to cover your mouth and nose with the back side of the elbow or napkin and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of the mask can limit the volume and range of exhale products that dissipate in the air when talking, sneezing and cough.
WHO has released instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist from Leeds University, "using a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, and touch with dirty hands is the main way of infection". Masks are also recommended for those who care for people who can be infected.
WHO recommends healthy people to wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using a mask really allows to reduce the number of touch to the face.
Several countries have started calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC centers, USA, recommend wearing non-medical facial masks. China separately emphasized the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 ft) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Thai health officials are urging people to make facial fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are forbidden to go outside without masks, closing their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnam government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has obliged all visitors to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, in Taiwan, where ten million medical masks per day was ordered to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and intercity buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going outside; residents who cannot buy masks were recommended to sew them on their own at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is a measure against infection to slow down the spread of the disease by minimizing close contacts between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theaters and shopping centers.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting trips, avoiding people's places, using contactless greetings and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments of the regions, especially the flash affected, are currently prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people who can gather in one place according to the recommendation of US government and health organizations has been rapidly reduced from 250 people (in regions where there were no data on COVID-19), to 50 people, and later - up to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned to gather in groups including more than two people. Seniors and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension, and weakened immune system are facing an increased risk of getting the virus in serious form. The CDC recommends them to stay home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of disease in the region. At the end of March 2020 WHO and other health authorities have begun to replace the term " social distance " with " physical distance ", thus clarifying the purpose of this measure - to reduce physical contacts within social connections, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
Using the term "social distancing" has been understood in such a way that people should be exposed to complete social isolation instead of staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among others, recommendations were given to sexual intercourse only with your regular partners you live with and who you are sure it does not have a virus and its symptoms.
Persons with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and those who suspect that they are infected, are recommended to self-isolation at home.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. The governments of many countries have also introduced mandatory or recommended that the population of affected areas to place themselves on quarantine.
Persons in high risk groups have been prescribed strictest quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected or recently visited the country or region, largely affected by the epidemic were recommended that quarantine within 14 days from the last possible contact.
Strategies against outbreak include deterring the spread of the disease, suppression or mitigation.
The disease is deterred at the early stage and aims to monitor and isolate infected, and implies other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease is impossible, efforts are aimed at mitigating the consequences: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of disease can be taken at the same time.
The suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the basic number of infection to below 1. Part of the infectious disease outbreak is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the alignment of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overload of health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with outbreak include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as school closure and abolition of mass activities; involving the community to promote such measures and participation in them; and environmental protection measures, such as surface cleaning. After the seriousness of the outbreak in China, more decisive actions were taken to contain outbreaks, such as isolation of whole cities and strict travel ban.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as organizing the alert system about the displacement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support for self-isolation infected persons and imposed great fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan increased the production of medical masks and fined for accumulation of excess supplies of medicines. Modeling in the UK and the United States showed that there are serious problems with regard to mitigation (slowdown, but not stopping the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the epidemic growth).
Optimal policy to mitigate the disease could reduce peak load on the health care system by 2/3, while mortality is doubled, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.
The suppression may be a preferred method, but it must be used until the virus is circulated among the population (or until the vaccine is developed, if it happens earlier), because otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There are no anti-viral drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment at the moment, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking unprescription medications for cold, drinking enough liquid and recreation can help to ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous introduction of liquid and breathing support.
Using steroid drugs can only hurt.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for use for COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO is considering improving capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the main response to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO Regional Bureau have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to help redistribution of resources at several levels, including the focus of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancellation non-urgent procedures, where possible, detection of the virus and isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as enhancing the ability of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of available ventives and beds.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection - the so-called "zero patient".
The first known case of infection with a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019 in Hubai province, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province has gradually increased.
They were mostly related to the wholesale market of Juanan seafood, which live animals were also sold, and one of the theories is that the virus has infiltraced into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has zoose origin. On December 26, the Hubei province clinic was registered in the case of mass disease of unknown origin, which was conducted by doctor Zhang Tianjin, who reported this case to the Jianghan Center for Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan.
On December 30, a group of doctors of the central clinic of Wuhan warned their colleagues about "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlian, were warned by the police of liability to spread false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, received a reprimand from her bosses for raising panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhanya Municipal Health Commission published a public notification and informed WHO about the situation.
Wuhanya health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread in other Chinese provinces, which was facilitated by Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway node.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two people sick in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by January 2020, 20, the symptoms of the disease already appeared in 6 people. As of March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy on the largest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world. As of April 2020, 9, more than 1,61 million cases of infection were registered worldwide, more than 97 people died, and more than 364 were recovered.
About 200 countries and territories recorded at least one registered case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen zone restricted free movement and established border control.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay at home, mandatory shelter or isolation), and curfew. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90 % of the United States population, were on any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are isolated in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in on isolation in South Africa and 1,3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1,7 billion people worldwide were on one form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2,6 billion people - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on December 2019, 1; according to another report, the accuracy of which has not been verified, this date is November 17
On December 26, the doctor Zhang Jisian worked with a mass disease of an unknown type pneumonia, which on December 27, her clinic notified the Center for Jianghankhan in Wuhan.
The primary genetic testing of the patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhanya published a public notification.
WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan about the responsibility of "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission argued that there was no "clear evidence" of the ability of the newly discovered virus to transmit from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary General of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping "People's War".
The events of the "largest quarantine in human history" began to be unfolding. On January 23, the sanitary cordon and the ban of entry to Wuhan and back, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities of Hubei province and affected a total about 57 million people.
In the city, the use of personal transport was banned.
In many places, Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25).
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital Huoshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was subsequently built, Leishan, who received other patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China has also reprofiled 14 other institutions in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issuance of health certificates for travelers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebration.
Universities and schools have been closed across the country.
Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote mode of work.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei province and beyond.
Public transport schedule has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
A regime for the movement of citizens has been introduced in many cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restrictions on outdoor movement. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, there was only one case of transmission of internal infection in the country, which occurred five days before, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 2020, 24, China's Prime Minister Lee Ketsyan reported that the spread of domestic disease was largely stopped and the outbreak in China was taken control.
On the same day, restrictions on trips to Hubei, except Wuhan, were lifted, this happened two months after the quarantine was closed. On March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for visa or residence permit will be suspended from March 28 The exact deadline for cancellation of this order was not called.
Those who want to come to China will have to apply for visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government urged enterprises and factories to resume work and provided monetary stimulating packages to companies. On April 4 at 10:00, the national three-minute of silence " was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Quinmin, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to those who died online while keeping physical distance, to avoid the COVID-19. re-19. flash
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, which occurred largely due to the fact that a large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji's followers came to Tega from Wuhan, which is allegedly a source of flash.
As of February 22, out of 9 church followers, 1 (approximately 13 %) reported having symptoms of the disease. On February 23, 2020, the highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea.
On February 28, more than 2 confirmed cases of infection were registered in Korea, and already on February 29, this indicator increased to 3
All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after three soldiers confirmed the presence of a virus.
The outbreak affected the number of travel, therefore, the airline's flight schedule has been changed. South Korea has launched a program to screening the population for the presence of a virus, tracking contacts and organizing quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the biggest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included compulsory information about their symptoms through a mobile app by all who came from abroad, the main testing for the virus, the next day, and expansion of testing opportunities that allowed to test up to 20 000 man.
The South Korea program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that there did not isolate whole cities. Initially, South Korean society was divided because of President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the President's actions, or called for impeachment for inadequate, in their opinion, government's response to the outbreak of the disease.
On March 23, it was reported that the lowest total number of infections in one day in South Korea has been registered in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be placed for a two-week quarantine.

The first measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher schools and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rukhani said on February 26, 2020 that the government does not plan to quarantine whole areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be placed on quarantine.
In March, plans were announced to limit intercity trips, but intense movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.
Shia shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020 Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of concealment of the scale of the flash in Iran by 28 February, more than ten countries were linked to cases with Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreaks there could be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian government by this date.
Iran's Parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members, reported on March 3, the results of the virus testing proved positive.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison leadership to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all prisoners.
The organization says there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths within one day - the largest number of deaths registered in the country since the outbreak.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials died from this disease.
By March 23, 50 new cases of coronavirus disease were registered in Iran every hour and every ten minutes - one new death from coronavirus.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also expected that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country's financial capabilities to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights demanded mitigation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease came into Italy, when two Chinese tourists had SARS-CoV-2 tests done in Rome, gave a positive result.
The number of cases of infection has become rapidly increasing, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to China and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A non-associate cluster of COVID-19. infection was discovered later. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21 On February 22, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the flash, according to which more than 50 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed on quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: " Entrance to the disease outbreak zone and departure from it will be blocked.
In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend the work of enterprises and to cancel sporting events ". On March 4, the Italian government ordered to close all schools and universities across the country as 100 people have already been recorded in Italy.
All major sporting events, including football games in series A, were supposed to be held behind closed until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered to suspend almost all commercial activities and close enterprises except for supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, ICU and ICU (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics on protocols to prioritize patients with medical care that may have to be involved.
On March 19, Italy overtook China by coronavirus mortality rate, ranked the first place in the world, after the announcement of 3 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, there were 128 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15 deaths and 21 cases of recovery, with most of these cases focused in the Lombardy region.
One of the CNN reports indicates that such a high mortality rate in Italy can be helped by a combination of two factors - a large number of older citizens of this country and the lack of opportunity to examine anyone who is still sick with coronavirus.
The United Kingdom responded to this virus most calmly of all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticized for the lack of a quick and serious response to the danger in which the population of the country. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending to refrain from all trips and social contacts that are not of priority, offering people to work from home as possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment facilities such as pubs and sports clubs should close as soon as possible and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 % of their wages, but not more than £ 2 in a month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning to gather more than two people and restricting travel and active outdoor recreation only to cases of extreme need.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were introduced with police involvement, penalties and dispersion of people.
Most enterprises were ordered to close, except for enterprises that provide "population life", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, economic stores, gas stations and garages.

Despite this, the testing of the population in the United States did not start immediately, and the true magnitude of the disease outbreak was hidden during this period.
Testing was difficult due to marriage test sets issued by the federal government in February, the absence of permission of the federal government to use non-state test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria before the beginning of March to allow citizens testing (this could be done only by the appointment of a doctor).

Employees may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others or fear of possible infection.
Commercial templates may change both for the types of goods for which there is demand and the ways to purchase such goods (e.g. shopping during non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there are possible disruption with the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The plan for the epidemic and response is possible to use the protection.
The plans address risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors, at home and communities, as well as risk factors of individual workers, such as elderly or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the control tools needed to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise from the epidemic.
Plans for epidemic preparedness and response can be subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the epidemic response goals: reducing the spread among staff, protecting people at higher health complications, business operations, and minimize negative effects on their supply chains.
Responses are affected by the degree of the seriousness of diseases in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control means is a structure widely used in ensuring safety and hygiene for grouping such funds depending on efficiency.
When the risk of COVID-19 is impossible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19, the most effective safety equipment, then - administrative measures and finally, personal protection.
Safety engineering means isolation of employees from jobs and do not rely on employee's behavior, which may be the most economically profitable solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action from an employee or employee.
Personal Protection (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help to eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protection should be chosen depending on the threat to an employee, fit in size (e.g. respirators), used consistently and properly, regularly verified, maintained and replaced as necessary, and removed, clean and stored or recycle to avoid infection.
The US Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) believes that the least risk posts have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all jobs include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay home, respiratory etiquette including cough and sneezing, napkins and garbage containers, remotely ready or replacement work, if necessary, recommendations for employees to avoid using other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Quick detection and isolation of persons who could potentially be infected is a critical step for protecting employees, customers, visitors and other persons in the workplace.
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend employees with acute respiratory diseases symptoms to stay home until heat ceases, lack of increased body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of heat-lowering or other medications symptoms, and also prescribes the flexibility of hospital leaf policies, allow staff to stay home to care for a sick family member and to ensure that employees are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, average risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1,8 m) with people who do not have confirmed data or suspicions of COVID-19 infection, but there is a chance of SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of disease in the society in the territory of business or in connection with recent trips of such a person to COVID-19.
These categories include public contact workers, for example, schools, high-density working environment and some major retail stores. Engineering and technical safety tools for such higher risk groups include installing high-effective air filters, increasing ventilation intensity, physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protective screens, and installation of windows for customer service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for this group and higher risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replace personal meetings with virtual means, replacement schedules, termination of non-critical trips to COVID-19, development of communication plans in emergency situations, including a forum for answering questions, providing relevant training for COVID-19 risk workers and protection measures, training for workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, the proper use of such funds, providing resources and working environment that promotes personal hygiene, regular hand washing requirement, limiting access to the workplace by customers and the public, posting information pointers on the need to wash hands and other measures against COVID-19. Depending on working tasks, employees at least average need to wear personal protection products, including combinations including gloves, robe, screen or face mask or protective glasses.
In rare cases, employees from such a risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on the plane, then to ensure proper safety of workers and other passengers, measures such as isolation of a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, providing a mask or asking such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when cough or sneezing.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler, either in touch with physiological liquids or potentially infected surfaces and perhaps additional personal protection if the patient has fever, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and infected surfaces should be cleansed and disinfected. In cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, safety measures include delayed illness travel, self-isolation and immediate information to the medical center on the ship when there are heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be held in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare institutions, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the community.
With a minimum or medium level of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, such as cancellation of departures for personal meetings, assembly and other mass events, such as physical or choral singing, cafeteria food, increasing the distance between desks, adjustment time of arrival and care, limitation of insignificant visits, use of a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, long-term non-school may be considered. For law enforcement officials performing daily duties, direct health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same instructions prescribed by ambulance feldshers, including the use of appropriate personal protection.
When close contact during detention, employees must clean and disinfect their shape belts and equipment before reuse using domestic aerosols or wipe, comply with standard operating procedures for preventing the spread of disease and disposal of used personal protection, as well as use and washing clothes.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff who contact patients with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19.
They have a very high risk of infection in their aerosol treatments or when collecting / processing of persons with confirmed diagnosis or expected COVID-19.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol education include sensing, cough, bronchoscopy procedures, some dental procedures and surveys or collecting invasive methods.
High-risk morgue workers are employees who handle the bodies of people with a confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such employees conduct an autopsy, they go into a very high risk category. Additional safety engineering equipment for such risk groups include the use of isolated premises for patients with a confirmed disease or COVID-19, including during aerosol education procedures.
In some health and morgue institutions, special ventilation with negative pressure can be effective.
Samples should be treated with the precautions provided for biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends allocating patients to distinguished waiting areas, depending on the availability of suspicions of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protection, OSHA recommends that respirators to workers interact at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed patients disease or suspicion of infection SARS-CoV-2, as well as those conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In the USA, the NIOSH, N95 or higher-grade respirators should be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies individual selection requirements and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for an employee. WHO does not recommend using special clothes, because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted respiratory, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends using only surgical masks for the staff who perform screening at the patient's reception point.
Those who collect samples from respiratory tracks from COVID-19 patients or carriers of this disease without aerosols, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the face, robe and gloves.
When conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol education, instead of surgical mask, you should wear a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Given the lack of individual protection products around the world, WHO recommends minimize the need for such remedies by using remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent windows, providing access to a patient with COVID-19, only those persons, who provide direct care, only use of personal protection necessary for a specific task, long use of the same respirator without removal, when working with multiple patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and coordinating the personal protection supply chain and recommendations not to use masks for people who have no symptoms.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the millionth of infections across the world
According to Jones Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection has exceeded one million worldwide.
At least 52 thousand people died from coronavirus-19
The border came on the same day when the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and the first case of death from coronavirus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that did not record coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1 confirmed cases of infection, including 79 in twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 Central European time (0800 UTC) April 4
More than 244 thousand cases of coronavirus infection were registered in the United States, of which at least 5 were flying exodus.
CBS News, referring to Jones Hopkins University reported that more than 1000 deaths caused by coronavirus infection were recorded in the US on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tightening measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin extended the regime of self-isolation of citizens of the city until May 1
Previously, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive salaries until April 30
Portugal Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; voting results: 215 votes for ", ten abstentions and one vote against ".
Saudi Arabia extended curfew in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina full-time, while earlier curfew lasted only from 3 am to 6 am.
Thailand planned to introduce curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio State Governor, Mike Dewaine, announced that the domestic self-isolation regime in the state has been extended by order until May 1
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
From the first symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases come to lung symptoms, but in some cases, the disease flows into viral pneumonia and polyorgan failure.
As of April 2020, 17, more than 2,24 million cases of infection in 210 countries and regions were registered, more than 153 people died from this disease.
More than 568 people have recovered. The virus is mostly spread in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops, cough, sneezing or conversation.
Although these drops are exhaled, they usually pose a threat to the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through long distance air.
People also get infected by touching the contaminated surface, then their eyes, nose or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms and later stages. Standard diagnostics method is a polymeric chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken like a nasopper.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspicion of illness, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations on using medical masks differ: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, while others demand it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may not have symptoms or have flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness.
Emergency symptoms include difficult breathing, constant pain or feeling of breast conscience, consciousness, difficulty waking up, face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, you should immediately seek medical assistance.
More often, symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose or throat pain.
Also, in different percentage ratios, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Some cases of diseases registered in China were originally only a feeling of chest and heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progression, developing into pneumonia, polyorgan failure, and in the end, death comes.
It's called incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97,5 % of people begin to manifest symptoms within 11,5 days of infection. According to available data, not all infected symptoms appear.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the disease is still completely unknown, but preliminary data indicates that they can help spread infection.
The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; Korean Disease Control and Prevention centers (KCDC) reported that in 20 % of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations about the virus, the disease was asymptomic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily summary since April 1; out of 166 cases of infections registered on this day, 130 (78 %) refused to be asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a great concentration of the virus.
With loud speech, there are more drops in the air than in the speech of normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that with open cough, drops can spread at a distance of up to 4,5 meters (15 ft).
The virus is usually not transmitted by airway, but the National Academy of Sciences suggested that the transmission of the virus is still possible, and testing of air recycled air collectors located in the hallways outside people's rooms showed the presence of a viral RNA.
Some medical treatments, such as intubation and heart-pulmonary ICU (SLR), can lead to spraying out of exhalation and therefore, the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through feces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms, but this risk is small.
Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not quite clear how easily the virus is spread, it is known that one patient usually infected by 2-3 others. The virus is able to survive on the surface from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus is able to live for one day, on plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and 99 % of copper surfaces up to 4 Hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and washing products have a pretty useful effect in combating infection: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and also able to eliminate it from skin surfaces and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as gasalconium chloride and gluconate chlorohexidine (surgical disinfectant) are less effective against this virus. During a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
Five out of six patients showed the highest blood virus concentration, and the sixth patient has the highest blood virus in the second day of testing.
Heavy sharp respiratory coronavirus syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe sharp coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first found in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in the relatives in nature of coronavirus.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap that opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the body most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates the masters cells through angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is most common in alveolar cells of lung cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the owner's cage with a characteristic surface glycoprotein - "thorn" (peplomer).
12 % of infected people who were diagnosed with a hospital in Wuhan have been diagnosed with acute damage to myocardial, which is more often found in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system violations observed during the progress of disease, but acute damage to myocardial can also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large numbers as they participate in the work of this body.
High frequency of thrombosis (31 %) and venous thromboembolism (25 %) was observed in patients in OIT with COVID-19 and can indicate adverse predictions. The autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocytocontaining inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressing epithelial respiratory cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-KSF T-cells correlated with recruiting inflammatory monocytes that provide IL-6 and severe lung pathology for patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also found at the autopsy.
WHO has also published several testing protocols on this disease.
Real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard method of testing.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by a noseal smear, but also can also be used by nose or mokrot.
Results are usually ready within a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks, and their results don't matter directly.
Chinese scientists have managed to highlight a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop tests with a polymeric chain reaction (PCR) to identify the presence of this virus.
As of April 2020, 4, antibody tests that could detect infection at the current time, and the past, were under development, but have not yet widespread.
Chinese experience in studying the results of these tests showed that their accuracy is only 60-70 %.
On March 21, 2020, the US Food and Drug Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first test for diagnostics in place, giving permission to use it at the end of this month. The diagnostics instructions issued by the hospital of Zhonnan Wuhan University specifies methods of detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multidimensional subpleval trics of "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural domination, a symptom of a bubble bridge (a fitting thickening of the partition with alveolar filling) and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic defeats and pathophysiology of COVID-19
The main results of the pathological study performed during the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurite, pericardite, sealing and lung swelling
You can observe four types of severity of viral pneumonia:
light form of pneumonia: lung swelling, pneumocytes hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitional inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the education of multi-nuclear giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exsudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intra-vascular closure (DVS syndrome); leukoerytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding people's places, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touch, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends cover your mouth and nose with a cough or sneezing, or, without a napkins, cover your mouth and nose inside the elbow area of the hand.
After cough or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out a quality hygienic procedure for hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of fabric facial masks in public places, in particular, to limit the transmission of infection to persons with asymptomatic disease. Social Distance Strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and enterprises were closed, restricted movement of citizens and major public events were closed.
Distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1,8 m) apart.
There are no medicines with confirmed effectiveness against COVID-19. As the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, the bulk of the measures against COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as the "plateau".
The CDC also recommends washing your hands with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with heavy hand pollution, as well as before eating and after a swelling, cough or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of disinfectant alcohol (alcohol content - at least 60 %) hand processing tool, but only when soap and water are not available. Regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These compositions use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial alcohol disputes and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown support therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs.
The CDC recommends those who suspect that they are infected with the virus to wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporate membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended to comply with personal hygiene rules, healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supporting therapy methods can be shown to patients with light symptoms at the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations on caring for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, ICU. doctors and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource - IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific COVID-19 treatment.
To treat symptoms as first line medications, some medical workers recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) compared to ibuprofen.
In the implementation of procedures that can occur in which air-drop-drop-drop, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
Medical workers who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends putting in air-drop-drop isolation (AIR) - an additional measure in addition to standard safety measures for contact and air. The CDC has published recommendations on the use of individual protection (SIZ) during the pandemic.
Recommended individual protection: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. From the above means, it is preferable to use respirators, not medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has allowed the use of these respirators in accordance with EUA EUA.
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but not under the instruction, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective facial screens or, at least, make masks independently at home.
In most cases, COVID-19 forms are not heavy enough to require artificial lung ventilation or alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is currently being studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with an intense air flow or two-level positive pressure in the airway.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical condition is as effective as the vent.
Some physicians choose for invasive mechanical lung ventilation if available, as this method significantly restricts the spread of particles in the air compared to the nasal cannasal air flow. The risk of severe disease for older people (those over 60, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack per capita hospital beds, and health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in cases of COVID-19 infections in severe form requiring hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5 % of patients were hospitalized in ICU, 2,3 % needed mechanical support for lung ventilation, and 1,4 % died.
In China, about 30 % of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually get into ICU.
The task of providing artificial lung ventilation is complicated, as sharp respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops under COVID-19, and oxygenation is causing more problems.
Inhaling pressure and PCV support is necessary to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal damage to the ventilation, which can develop pneumotorax.
On earlier models of fans, high VAT may not be available.
Research on potential treatment began in January 2020, and at the moment several antiviral drugs are under clinical trials.
The most promising is the remdesivir.
The development of new medicines may last until 2021, but some of the testing has already been approved for other purposes or are in the last stages of the test.
Anti-viral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of disease.
Recommended by WHO volunteers take part in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatment methods. The FDA has granted temporary permit to use reconvalescent plasma as experimental treatment where human life is in serious or direct danger.
Its application has not been subjected to clinical studies that must be carried out to prove safety and effectiveness of treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to fight the outbreak of disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number to login.
The app can detect "close contact" with surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is found, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Analytics of big data collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence - such tools are used to track infected people and people in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security authorities to track the data of mobile phones of people who are allegedly infected with coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for those who can contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided to federal government agencies of Germany and Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the whereabouts of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology was introduced to identify quarantine violators.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Julio Galler said that mobile network operators say that "40 % of people still continue to move around the territory".
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, which was attended by more than 42 participants.
Estonia's President Kersty Caljulaid also urged to seek creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may be stressed about quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O ' Connor's words: "Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, health, stress and economic recession are the perfect conditions for hurting people's mental health and well-being".
The disease can leak in light shape with minor or absent symptoms reminiscent of other common upper respiratory diseases, such as normal cold.
Patients with a light form of illness are usually recovered within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 form based on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data on COVID-19 Some people have COVID-19 can hit their lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
Persons with the heaviest flow of COVID-19 can quickly progress into acute respiratory disstress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorgan failure.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal thromboeducation, as well as heart, kidneys and liver problems.
The anomalies of tromboeducation, especially the increase in protrombine time, were described in 6 % of patients with COVID-19, while kidney failure is observed in 4 % of this group.
Approximately 20-30 % of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to research in early stage, the average time from initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2,8 % and 1,7 % among women.
Histopathological studies of postmortal lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
In pneumocytes, there were viral cytopathic changes.
The appearance of the lung resembles acute respiratory disstress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11,8 % of deaths registered by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart problems were to increase troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 % of hospitalized patients had preceding health problems. Accessibility of medical resources and socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary due to such regional differences and methodological difficulties.
Not enough effective calculation of cases in easy form can lead to an overdue to mortality rate.
Nevertheless, the fact that deaths occur as a result of past-acquired diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is underrated.
Smokers have severe symptoms of COVID-19 developed in general, 1,4 times more often, and such patients were about 2,4 times more often needed intensive care or died compared to non-smoking. Concerns were expressed about the effects of the disease in the long term.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinics found that some patients who have recovered from this disease, the lungs decreased by 20-30 %, and their scan detected damage.
After recovery, this can also lead to "After ICU" syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients have a strong immunity against it has been developed from the virus.
Judging by the current of other coronavirus, this is considered likely, but it was also reported cases where after recovery from COVID-19, the coronavirus tests were still positive.
It is believed that in these cases, there was an exacerbated protracted disease rather than a reinfection.
The virus is believed to be natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost completely due to its transmission from the person.
A study of the first 41 cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls on December 2019, 1 the earliest date of the first case of the disease.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is December 8, 2019
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All numbers vary according to the region and the time of disease, they are also affected by testing, quality of health systems, treatment schemes, time since the beginning of the outbreak, and population, such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency codes under ICB-10: U07. 1-for deaths from laboratory confirmed infection SARS-2 and U07. 2-for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed with COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a certain period of time.
According to Jones Hopkins University statistics, as of April 2020, 17, the global number of deaths and infections is 6,9 % (153).
This figure varies depending on the region. Some other methods include determining the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as well as determining mortality rate from the infected infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) that died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not attached to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not developed for all patients who have suffered infection, you can understand how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castillion d ' Adda, a small village with a population of 4600 people, 80 people (1,7 %) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of carnival among youth, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths could be officially classified as such.
Furthermore, Germany's health care system has not been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 % of the population can have antibodies, judging by the blood donor.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0,004 % of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to research conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The greatest risk group is men over 50 years old; the gap between men and women decreases only from the age of 90
In China, the mortality rate was 2,8 per cent for men and 1,7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, less prevalence of smoking among women, accompanying males (e.g. hypertension manifested in men at a younger age than women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 % of those infected were men, and 72 % of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and ARVI have various gender statistics.
Most of health workers, especially nursing staff, are women, respectively, they have more likely to get infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of this disease - COVID-19.
WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adan GebreJesus, explains: " CO " means " crown ", " VI " virus ", " D " - " disease " (disease), and 19 was flash first detected: December 31, 2019.
Such a name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international name recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called heavy acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public messages, WHO further uses the terms " COVID-19 " and " virus responsible for COVID-19 ".
Both the disease and the virus itself is usually called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were usually called " coronavirus " and " Wuhank coronavirus ".
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical places in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended using the terms " acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov " and " 2019-nCoV " as temporary names of the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, official names were published - " COVID-19 " and " SARS-CoV-2 ".
Due to restrictions on standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials, such as nose swab tampons, as well as parts of the ventives.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it within the required time, then one of the local production was reprofiled and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first time the outbreak of COVID-19, the Internet has spread various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects.
People can probably infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At the moment, there is no approved virus or medicines for its treatment.
Currently, government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are undergoing various international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial ("SOLIDARITY Test"), which aims to assess the healing effect of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no ready vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing drug candidates for vaccine.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrates human cells using ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous research on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First of all, researchers are eager to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead form, aims to cause a quick immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19. infection.
The second strategy, creating a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is aimed at destroying S-thorn protein, which helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccine, new method for creating vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed on any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficiency. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine for four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Anti-body intensification has been identified as one of the potential problems in developing SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Drugs approved for malaria were estimated during seven tests, four of these studies were hydroxychlorohin or chlorohin.
Reprofiling antiviral drugs is most of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine studies of phase III on remdesivir were conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. For the same purpose, several other existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorohin and hydroxychlorokhin, lopinavir / rhetonavir, and lopinavir / ronavir combined with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who received remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already in the USA, China and Italy. The use of chlorohin previously used for malaria treatment was considered in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
Nevertheless, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend using chlorohin.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to lethal exodus.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for emergency use of hydroxychlorohin and chlorohin at the discretion of doctors who treat patients with COVID-19. The Chinese instructions of the 7th edition also specifies interferon, ribavirin or umiphenovir, as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for inhibating SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo, showing SARS-CoV-2 inhibitrations in low concentrations. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 penetration through interaction with ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to reconcile protein the transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies on the use of chlorohin and hydroxychlorohin with or without azitromycin have serious restrictions that prevent the medical community from using these treatment without more detailed study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication at the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There are evidence that hydroxychlorokhin can have the properties of hypercytokinemia. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, a tocilizumab was included in the recommendation for coronavirus treatment.
This drug was released on stage 2 of the non-randomized test, which is being conducted nationally in Italy, after positive results were obtained from patients with severe disease.
Combined with a blood serum on ferritine to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refracter cytokins caused by another cause, T-cellular therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocylizumab is an effective means of treating cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of cleansed and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19, to people who need them is currently being considered a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results were unconvincing.
Neutralization of the virus is an expected effect that passive antibodies can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms, such as anti-body cellular cytoxicity and / or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive therapy with antibodies, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconvalescent blood serum may be increased, which consists of liquid part of the blood of the healed patients and contains antibodies against the virus.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of syndromes with a high level of resemblance
Lee Wenlian, a doctor of the central clinic of Wuhanya, who later got infected and died from COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packaging that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday night, the Australian Woolworths and Coles stores reduced the amount of toilet paper packaging that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country, to two and one pack respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a restriction on one pack.
These restrictions have been reported in announcements at the cash box office and on the Facebook page.
Citizens reportedly started making emergency stocks due to fears that COVID-19 may lead to the introduction of a regime of general self-isolation.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one pack.
Earlier, March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number to 4 packs.
The Coles trading network in its press release of March 8 reported that with the four packs restrictions " in many stores, toilet paper is still getting sold too fast - one delivery within an hour ", and called such demand " unprecedented ", while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called this trend " unexpected ".
According to the representative of Woolworths, last week there was a dramatic increase in sales.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited this number to two packs.
To fill the deficit, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased supply frequency, Woolworths ordered additional batches while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to restock, but this is difficult due to local authorities restrictions on the timetable for trucks.
It expects the cost of products, as suppliers try to meet demand, but less and less favorable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to stocks depletion, some stores are unable to hold stocks on Wednesdays.
In the report News.com. au Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, told me that stores replenish stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, so the amount of stock is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of the goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the lack of stocks.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and goods like toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn't panic like that",-says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the producer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported on the end of stocks.
According to News.com. au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper toilet paper manufacturer, also producing Sorbent products, reported that they are working around the clock to ensure enough goods.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the absence of buyers on the week of Labour Day holiday, some real estate sellers started offering free toilet paper to the first auctions.
The Thursday edition of the daily edition of NT News printed in Darwin included an eight-page tab designed to cut and use as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia report on March 3, stores reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of goods purchased, saying they do not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantery, hand washing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, Sunday night it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.

PERMISSIONS: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that shed light on the relationship of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We did not have precedents of such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperation and community development around the world, which is at the core of such an organization.
We watched friendly and caring relationships between all of our colleagues, which was reflected in electronic correspondence, calls and chats - a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, thankfully, amazing people work with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed about the appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important the world is to address Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible because of your work, whether it is to ensure the functioning of sites, pay for our colleagues, or community safety protection.
The world needs information provided in Wikipedia and today it's even more important than ever before.
At such a time to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
Due to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will be making important changes to our work together, starting in the coming week.
Adjustment of the order of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
In the course of communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, then let it be.
For all staff, contractors and freelance employees:
according to our expectations, it will be required to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until the following orders are received.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work well for more hours, this is allowed for our mission purposes.
However, the world is unpredictable now; whatever your needs are, whether to take care of your family, purchase food items or going to a doctor, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't follow your working hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
This is clear and undeniable, but we mention it.
No hospital sheet or leave required: just inform your supervisor and help the team review the calendar and work schedule to reach key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, let Brian know from T & C Ops to provide support and proper attention from your situation).
Hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirm our intention to comply with our contractors and employees with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will receive a payment according to normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This in particular means periods of illness when you can't work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in times like this.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust your actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We should always support these activities.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising (among others) are critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current goals and shift the focus on providing support, which is essential to our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us and we just focus on the most significant projects.
Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We don't plan to work "twice as much to catch up on the missed" after the pandemic is over.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic terms for the current time.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed and will work on setting new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What's happening to APP (annual plans)?
In order to adjust the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the terms of our Annual Plan 2020-2021
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time to build a budget, which will allow staff to prioritize critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, and anyone who needs or who wants to work, A reduced schedule will be provided for the next few weeks.
Such an extension of the deadline allows to significantly reduce the current burden of planning and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, to inform representatives and teams up-to-date information on the next steps immediately after receiving the corresponding confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for leading this work.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week we found out that one of our colleagues from San Francisco may be infected with the COVID-19. virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in San Francisco office.
They used antiviral medical class solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevator halls through which we can access our floor.
The building uses its own rules that prescribe careful with the use of products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in DC (DC) is on the WeWork network that shared with us and all DC staff, its COVID-19. rules.
Last week, our office in the county of Columbia has completely moved to remote work according to San Francisco instructions.
As some of our colleagues from New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting a room in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues who work remotely know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some tips:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them into a course consisting of days.
Clearly determine the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out the materials in advance.
By default, use video connection to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools like Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator - a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in chat and control the list of speakers, as well as responsible for keeping notes (or joint).
If you need to use a convenient headset, please contact the technical support service via email.
Take advantage of your benefits of Wellness Reimbursement when buying snacks.
Connect to #remoties in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is exploring ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to promote the efficiency of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grants to cancel wikimedia-funded events such as "editathons" until WHO announces the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may be impossible to conduct agreed grants and no one will be fined for forced delays or changing such goals.
We will hold follow up next week with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
Universal moods in the global community is not only a grieving of interrupting work, but also some sense of relief for mutual understanding and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
Regarding prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide community space to monitor impact and communication.
We stay in touch on COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC / 07:00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together by connecting to each other.
We are together in this situation and ready to help anything we can.
At the same time, you can still receive information from such electronic correspondence, and other important information on COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have a significant impact on the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflow, problems with information coverage or if necessary, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and connect as needed.
If you have privacy concerns, please contact Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as abandoning our work and our commitments.
Rather the other way around: this is recognition of the possible current need for a drastically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to provide the opportunity to continue the work to provide the necessary support of our movement and the world through the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate times.
Today is the time to support each other and create a space for important work coming weeks and maybe months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with maximum benefits as soon as this need arises.
And now please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of Leadership Team (Grant I, Heater W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Refresh diagnostic criteria for " cases of suspicion of disease " and " confirmed cases " COVID-19
February 6, 2020 Our group has published a brief guide for diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information about our experience we have gained and provides verified recommendations to combat this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually based on the current results of research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for " disease suspicion " and " confirmed cases " in accordance with the document " Recommendations on diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 " (seventh version), released by the National Health Committee of China.
December 2019 There was an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which now received the official name of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called "severe acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
March 11, 2020 WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a brief guide and published it on the Internet on the website of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020
This post attracted a lot of attention.
We note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually based on the current results of research and clinical experience; thus the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between January 16 to March 3, 2020 Seven issues of the document "Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19" published by the National Health Committee of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) and the content of some of its provisions have changed significantly.
Recently, the work prepared by Zhou (Zhou) with co-authors, comments on our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostics suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as provided valuable background information on this pandemic, which covered the whole world.
We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of "Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19" (test seventh version) and the results of current research, and their work needs an update.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (March 3, 2020) to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming the case of suspicion of the disease, one element of the characteriological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or location in the city. Wuhan and its surroundings or in other settlements where COVID-19 cases were registered within 14 days before symptoms are shown; (2) history of contacts with patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (c positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from the city. Wuhan and its surroundings or from other settlements, where COVID-19 cases were registered within the last 14 days before symptoms are shown; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (₹ 2 cases characterized by high temperature or respiratory symptoms registered within 2 weeks at small plots such as a house or apartment, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19; (3) total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage manifestation of symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of the disease should be based on the case of suspicion of the disease with one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genome sequencing of the virus shows high homogenity regarding new coronavirus; (3) positive results of serotest for SARS-Cov-2 antibodies IgM and IgG; or changing the test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, or titer growth at least 4 times in the recovery phase of the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) real-time test for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples were added.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) Issues; and then the seventh edition, the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers searching for the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as to test samples, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of various samples and helps to incorporate positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
However, there is more evidence of the need to be caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without expressing symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou (Zhou) and others should be updated as it has no clinical symptoms classified as a low risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to receive more direct evidence and encourage readers to comment.
With regard to the diagnosis of " suspicion of disease " and " confirmed cases ", we invite readers to monitor and strictly follow the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update their recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19-day maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that there were 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were home.
In total, 17 deaths were registered.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora told that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two dead were over the age of 60, two between the age of 51 to 60, and one at the age of 41-50
She also reported that two dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19. pandemic
Clinic employee informed the local news agency Anadolu that Jalal Syfur Rahman, director of the Bengal anti-corruption commission, which was in treatment at the Kuwaiti clinic.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh Obaidul Quader said that public transport will be discontinued for a longer term than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport work has been stopped from March 26 and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, April 4
Transportation of essential goods - medicines, fuel and food - was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were registered in Bangladesh on March 8, two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have already recovered.
The World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-Cov-2.
Although the term "pandemic" characterizes only the extent of the disease, not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that governments need to take action:
"All countries together are still able to influence the progress of the pandemic".
It is possible if countries are involved in identifying, testing, treatment, isolation of patients, monitoring cases of disease, and mobilization of their citizens ", said Mr. Tedros Adan GebreJesus.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming rate of the spread and seriousness of the disease and the disturbing level of inaction".
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in his interview on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus has been tracked from the moment of its emergence to continuous global spread".
Mr. Gebrejus expressed a similar point of view, saying that " we have never seen a coronavirus pandemic.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before ".
First, in January, WHO declared an outbreak of this disease in public health emergency, which is of international importance, and then granted it a new status - a pandemic.
Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it will be worse".
According to the Associated Press on Thursday, at least 126 cases of COVID-19 were registered in the world, more than 4 people died.
Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated virus SARS-Cov-2 includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OT-PCR, which recoronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed only for detection of SARS-CoV-2. RNA.
It is used to confirm enough recent or active infections.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and for popular control.
Anti-body tests identify the number of people who suffered the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to treat them to the hospital, or were absent.
The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing, no country has been reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By March 23, no country was able to verify more than 3 % of its population, and information about the number of tests carried out in different countries is very contradictory.
These differences in information probably significantly affect registered mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
With real-time polymeric chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out of respiratory trails, including a nose or a sample of a mokrRT-PCR.
Results are usually available for a few hours to 2 days.
From-PCR-test, carried out on the swashes taken from the throat, is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, continuing, however, multiply in the lungs.
Infected patients tested in the second week of illness may be taken as an alternative to lower respiratory tract material with a sucking catheter, or you can use the food (wet).
One of the early tests of the PCR was developed at the Shari Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and founded 250 sets that were distributed World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-Cov-2 detection kit based on the PCR of clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the gene "E", common to all beta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. Chinese company BGI Group became one of the first companies to obtain permission from China's National Drugs Management for emergency use a set SARS-CoV-2 detection based on PCR. In the United States, the CDC Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes their real-time diagnostic panel for the RT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of test sets issued incomplete results due to faulty reagents and narrow area of testing conducted by CDC in Atlanta; as a result in February 2020 on average, fewer than 100 samples per day.
Two components tests were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date, state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Medicine Quality Control Office as part of emergency use permit. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics started testing for COVID-19 across the country from March 9, 2020
No quantitative restrictions have been stated; fence and processing of tests must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology "VECTOR".
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervision Service. It was reported that on March 2020, 12, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19. March 2020, 13, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA approval for using a test that can be held within 3,5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit for Abbott m2000 laboratories to test the Abbott m2000; previously issued such permission to Hological, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives EUA from the FDA for about 45 minutes.
The FDA has also approved a test that uses the technology of isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18 cars in the US, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50 tests per day. Taiwan is currently being developed using a monoclonal antibody, which is linked to the nucleocapse protein (N-protein) of a new coronavirus, and there is hope for the possibility of getting results in 15-20 minutes, like an express flu test.
The March 2020 Specialized Literature Review concludes that "chest x-ray has a little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [ computer tomography ] can be of such value even before symptoms appear".
Typical signs identified during CT include bilateral multidimensional subplural sealing tricks of "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetric and aposterior distribution.
Subpleural domination, the symptom of the bubble bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions match other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, American College of Radiology published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnosis". As of March 2020, CDC recommends using exactly the method PCR.
Partly immune response to infection is expressed in antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after day 7 of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct popular control. Analysis can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by diagnosis on site (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one specimen of peripheral blood, although serial samples may be used to track immune response.
At PoCT, one blood sample is usually received by puncture of each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood fence stage is not required to take test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all necessary registration procedures and can now spread their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency application test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits to use their test kits that can detect IgG and IgG and IgA blood samples with the ability to fight the virus.
Testing performance is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore, this method works much faster than the usual PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. At the beginning of April, the UK found that none of the antibody analysis kits acquired is satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspicion of the virus to stay home: "Emergency Department staff give the patient a sample test", the patient spits in it, gives back and gets the test results. British NHS announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing at home that eliminates the risk of infection by patients of other clinics, or the need to disinfect an ambulance if used to transport the patient. During the express testing on COVID-19, a medical worker takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centers helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. On March 2 in Germany, the National Association of Doctors of compulsory Health Insurance said that it is ready to conduct about 12 tests a day in outpatient conditions, and a week earlier they could only do only 10 tests a week.
If the examination is appointed by a doctor, the expenses are covered by health insurance.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany's total performance in terms of testing is 160 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct express testing in several large cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests passed in Germany was unknown as only positive results are registered.
The first laboratory study showed that at SARS-CoV-2, a total of 483 tests were taken at SARS-12/2020, up to week 12/2020, inclusive, and 33 491 sample (6,9 %) the result was positive. Researchers of Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample shows a positive result. In Wuhan on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory with an area of 2000 square meters. metres of emergency detection called " Huo-Yan " (Chinese, or " Fire Eye ") that can handle more than 10 samples per day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; modeling showed that if this laboratory was not put into operation at such an accelerated pace, Hubei disease would be 47 % more, and accordingly, quarantine costs would also be twice as high.
Huo-Yang laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened at the opening of the Lab in Wuhan.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity indicators were 50 tests per day. Open multiplex schemes of Origami Assays have been released, which can test up to 1 patients on COVID19 using only 93 tests. Such balanced structures can work in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the lack and insufficient number of reagents, mass testing in the EU, UK and the USA became problematic.
As a result, some authors addressed test samples processing protocols that provide for heating samples at 98°C (208°F) within 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the amount of coronavirus testing carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita is now exceeding any other country, and most of the population will be tested soon.
This was due to express testing opportunities, along with the acquisition from Group 42 and BGI mass testing laboratory (created based on their Huo-Yan emergency laboratories in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is able to carry out tens of thousands of Ts of tests of RT-PCR a day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale working outside China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of making test kits that go to low-income countries that do not have resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by United States sanitary and epidemiological centers was unavailable until January 28, leading to the absence of test sets in the United States. At the very beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States, there were problems with reliability of test sets, and these countries, and Australia, were unable to provide enough sets recommended by health experts.
But in South Korea, experts say, widespread availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has worked to provide testing opportunities, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programs, as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19. pandemic. As a result of the increase in demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private US laboratories, which have received hundreds of thousands of samples tests, turned out to be overloaded, and stocks of materials for the fencing of smear and chemical reagents quickly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported on problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
American test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws", and for this reason, the government eliminated bureaucratic barriers that prevented private test development. Spain purchased test sets from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these sets were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the result of inaccuracy could be a bad samples fence or misuse of sets.
The Spanish Ministry said it would revoke the sets that produce inaccurate results and replace them with other sets - Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 % of the test sets that the Czech Republic acquired in China gave the wrong results. 1,2 million test sets purchased by Slovakia in China have also been found inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovich proposed to drop them to the Danube. Athesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test sets purchased in China had a " high level of errors " and the Ministry " did not use them ". UK bought 3,5 million test sets in China, but early April 2020 years have been announced the unfit of these sets for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose tests have produced a positive result on SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring people who were in contact with such patients, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Wo, where for the first time in Italy died from COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing the entire population of about 3400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were placed on quarantine.
Entrance to the territory of the settlement was closed and this measure completely stopped the spread of infection.
In the context of intense tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less stressful than in other developed countries, and there was not necessary to imposed extreme restrictions as forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many events were cancelled and on March 28, Singapore began to advise residents to stay home, but schools that ended on March 23, opened on schedule.
Several other countries, for example, Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic due to intense tracking of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions were less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that more tests were carried out in countries than deaths, mortality rates were far lower, probably because these countries have managed to identify more patients with weak symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results of COVID-19 tests to one of 16 control WHO laboratories for confirming testing.
7 of these 16 control labs are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the next chart, the indicators of the "positive results" column depends on the policy of testing adopted in a specific country.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in interest compared to the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
A rapidly growing rate of cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in the UK between January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union / European Economic Area and in the UK, thus confirming that despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapandemic all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care offices need to increase the level of preparedness for patients with COVID-19, who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
December 31, 2019 in the city Wuhan of Chinese Hubei province has been recorded several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus is now known as the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
From now on, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 began to call a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available to date, about 80 % of people with COVID-19, the disease leaks in a light form of or without pneumonia infection, while most patients are recovering.
About 14 % of COVID-19 cases develop into a heavier form with the need for hospitalization, and in the other 6 % takes critical form when intensive care is required.
The death rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 %.
This study analyzes the trends of COVID-19 cumulative incidence in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK and their comparison with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei province.
We are also comparing the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA and in the UK with data on Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020
COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA and UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the CEO of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19. pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria for which WHO determines the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU / EEA were registered in France on January 24, 2020-all three patients returned from the city. Wuhan of the Hubei province of China.
As of March 2020, 15, cases of COVID-19 have been identified in all 30 EU / EEA countries and in the UK, with 31 December 2019 to the date recorded 39 768 infections and 1 deaths, of which 17 cases, including 1 fatal, are Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 on the number of recorded cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, such as the ministries of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to analyze COVID-19 trends in the EU / EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data in Italy.
As an indicator of the propagation of active cases of COVID-19, a cut covid-19 was calculated covid-19 in 14 days, taking into account the usual COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to March 15, 2020
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country on 8:00 March 2020, 15, compared to Italy data for the period from January to March 15, 2020
COVID-19 development trends in EU / EEA and UK
Trends for the development of the cut cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the 14-day period in the EU / EEA countries and in the UK as a whole were in line with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (figure. 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the UK as a whole began to grow around February 21, and on February 2020, 28, there was a sharp of this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but also in all other EU / EEA countries and the UK there were similar trends in the increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
In the figure. 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU / EEA and in the UK compared to the same indicator for Italy for the period from January to March 15, 2020, 31
According to this data, the total number of cases already registered as of 8:00 March 15 in 15 other EU / EEA countries and UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA and UK.
The observed trends of COVID-19 cumulative incidence suggest that the pandemic is developing at comparable speed in all countries.
And this is despite different stages in different countries, the differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and perhaps different criteria for the recognition of disease cases and different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19, including "catching" testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10 % of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions are already been filled.
Currently, the data on the admission of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) ICU ICU / EEA is available only available for 6 % and 1 % of cases respectively (no data).
However, there is a systematic collection of such information to complement the current surveillance data, which is the number of cases and deaths.
According to the 2010-2011 study conducted in Europe, there is a significant scattered in the number of beds in intensive care offices and intensive care units: from 29,2 in Germany to 4,2 beds per 100 people per 000 Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 beds in ICU and intensive care offices per 100 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the express risk assessment of COVID-19 shows scenarios of modelling of health systems with estimates for hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU / EEA and in the UK, when the risk of lack of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90 %.
Since cases are grouped in certain EU / EEA and UK regions and hospitals and intensive care offices usually serve the population of a certain territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in the intensive care offices are recommended if possible the level of Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the EU / EEA and UK, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 contact scenario, which has been unweakened for a long time, and for the increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who need of medical care and in particular, intensive care, for example, can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the Express risk assessment, an operational, proliferation of SARS-COV-2 has a prompt and comprehensive approach, with a further transition from deterrent to minimizing consequences, as given the predictable rapid growth in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may not have enough time to understand, take and adjust their response accordingly unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on the results of express risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries only have a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce their health systems.
If you don't do so, the health care system in other EU / EEA will face an influx of patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Zoonoznoe origin of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated coevolution of coronavirus (Cov) and their carriers, including people, for millennia.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coronavirus (HCov) cause lung disease, such as common colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our idea of how disastrophic and life-threatening to life can be.
The emergence of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-CoV-2) in central China again drew attention to coronavirus and surprised us with a high transmission, but weaker pathogenity of this virus compared to the SARS virus-Cov.
The coronavirus infection of a person is a zoonosis, and understanding of its zoonosis will be very useful.
Most of the coronavirus of human beings come from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate tanks are also known - carriers of some human coronavirus.
The definition of carrier animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals that are carriers of coronavirus can also shed light on the coronavirus pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we provide available data on seven human coronavirus, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonous origin and ways of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we compare and comparison of different human coronavirus in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, today's epidemic caused by coronavirus detected in 2019 (COVID-19).
In addition, the conditions necessary for successful change of carriers and the impact of the virus evolution on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronavirus is a Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar thread of the RNA.
These viruses with the largest RNA-containing viruses, which accommodate between 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides, have been named thanks to its form, which, when considered under an electronic microscope resembles the crown.
In terms of structure, coronavirus contain unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genomes contain two large open partially overlap reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcasted into polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further recycled to generate 16 unstructured proteins designsp1~ 16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured protein, including spike protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
In other coronavirus lines, a number of line-specific accessory proteins are also encoded.
Based on the differences in sequences of protein \ coronavirus are divided into four types (alpha -, beta -, gamma and coronavirus), while the type of betacoronavirus includes most human coronavirus and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and betacoronavirus are bats and rodents, while birds are the main tank for gamma and coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus has constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some of them evolved to dangerous pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus are known.
These include human alfacoronavirus HCov-229 E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronavirus include HCoV-OC43, HKU1, the coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov), the coronavirus of the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-Cov) and the coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome of SARS-Cov-Cov-2.
Human coronavirus HCov-229 E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause light form symptoms, such as cold and (or) diarrhea.
Unlike them, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic infectious infectious diseases of lower respiratory pathways in a relatively more patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory disease (RZ) and manifestations of extralung symptoms.
The first thread of the human coronavirus HCoV-229 E, B814, was obtained from a sample of a separated patients who were sick with a cold in the 1960 s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229 E and HCoV-OC43 virus that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a common concept that the infection of human coronavirus was considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8 people were sick, and the total mortality rate was approximately 10 %.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with sporadically spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus found in 2019 (2019-nCov), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is an aronavirus disease of the current coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), which is as of As of March 3, 2020, more than 3 lives were killed, and the number of infections exceeded 91 people.
The alarm is received and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2. pandemic.
All seven human coronavirus have zoonosis, their sources are bats, mice or pets.
Numerous data sets show in favor of the evolutionary nature of all human coronavirus from bats, to which viruses have adapted well adapted well and do not show pathogenetic properties, but demonstrate wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the whole world a serious challenge from a medical, scientific, social and moral perspective.
The study of the zoonous mechanism of the origin of human coronavirus will make it possible to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors that limit interspecies transfer.
Perhaps it will also prompt or accelerate the search for a tank, intermediate and amplifying SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which is very important for preventing the respread of the disease in the future.
This review contains general information about zoonosis, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronavirus are not usually not pathogenic for their reservoir media, but are becoming pathogenic after the interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the trend of evolution of human coronavirus, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by the weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. is considered.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930 s.
Before the strain of the HCoV-229 E virus was first obtained from a sample of the nose-sil patients with colds, various coronavirus found different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, pigs, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronavirus have been identified.
Table 1 informative and clearly presents a brief history of the detection of human coronavirus in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229 E virus was derived from the airway patients with infectious infectious respiratory tract in 1966; this virus adapted to breeding in WI-38. pulmonary cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229 E have colds, including headache, sneezing, general malax and throat, while high temperature and cough were observed in 10-20 % of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was allocated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of suckers.
Clinical signs of infection with HCoV-OC43 look similar manifestations of HCoV-229 E virus infection, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from defeat by other respiratory pathogens, such as type A flu viruses and rinovirus.
Both the HCoV-229 E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus have widespread in the world and are usually transmitted in winter in moderate latitudes.
The incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, and followed by approximately two-week illness.
According to the results of the study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229 E virus have developed a common cold of light shape.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity have a severe lower respiratory infection.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the "epidemic of atypical pneumonia", was the first in the history of humanity, a well-documented pandemic caused by the coronavirus, and the disease turned out to be the SARS-Cov virus, the third of the third of the detected human coronavirus.
The first case of SARS disease was detected in late 2002 in Guangdong province.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease has spread in many countries and across different continents.
It was estimated that each disease could infect about two more people; the incubation period was between 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the viral load was 10 days.
SARS-CoV patients initially appeared muscle pain, headaches, high temperature, general malnutrition and chills, and among later symptoms, cough and respiratory failure.
SARS are lymphopenia, liver violations and increased creatkinases are common deviations from SARS.
SARS patients also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cells proliferation and macrophague levels.
Approximately 20-30 % of patients later need ICU and mechanical lung ventilation.
In such severe cases \ in addition to lower respiratory tracks, other organs may also be infected, including gastrointestinal, liver and kidneys, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that may be lethal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was allocated from the open biopsy of the lung relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been aimed at the research of human coronavirus.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it primarily strikes young children, older people and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For HCoV-NL63 disease, manifestations such as runny nose, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study describes the allocation of the same virus from the nazal material taken from a 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but it is actually common everywhere.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to cause approximately 4,7 % of widespread respiratory diseases, and its peak at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is connected to obstructive laryngitis, which is also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to non-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolithic, HCoV-HKU1 is linked to the exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229 E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus that causes respiratory illnesses of light forms, have been identified worldwide.
All these four coronavirus caused non-hospital infections have adapted well to people, and their mutation, which involves high-pathogenic diseases are usually unlikely, although the incidents were unknown, as a rare example with a more virulent subtype HCov-NL63, which Recent reports have caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to effectively transmit and preserve in the human body, these human coronavirus become less virulent or pathogenic.
The coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first allocated in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most laboratory confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, there are cases and dissemination through episode secondary cases of infections with close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressing acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also developed acute kidney failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronavirus transmitted to human.
More than 30 % of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2 laboratory confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome with high mortality (34,4 %), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
Between mid-end of December 2019 in town. Wuhan of the Chinese province of Hubei has been identified clusters of patients with pneumonia, which now, looking back to the past, is linked to an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself was called "coronavirus infection 19" (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90 confirmed cases in the world, with the death rate of approximately 3,4 %.
It should be noted that the death in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4,2 %, and beyond it is 1,2 %.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronavirus, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by temperature, cough and breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly move into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82 %), these viruses still form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater ability to transmission than SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov.
SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections have been recorded, which indicates the ability of this virus is rapidly spread around the world.
As a result of comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronavirus, important similarities and differences are revealed.
First, coronavirus transmitted to a person have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coronavirus.
Secondly, the gravity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus causing extrahospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229 E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to what is most often observed in human coronavirus infections, including non-specific manifestations, light symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, you can highlight a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, in terms of SARS-CoV-2, there are also interesting patterns characteristic of human coronavirus that cause extrahospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronavirus causing extrahospital infections.
On the other hand, there is still to check whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission decreases with each subsequent virus (i. e infection of each next person), as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronavirus causing extrahospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the samples of kala.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral path of SARS-CoV-2 is as meaningful (at least in some circumstances) as it is in the case of SARS-Cov.
The question of the possible seasonal SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronavirus that cause non-hospital infections is of particular interest.
Nevertheless, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogencies and sustainable distribution after the transition through people.
All four human coronavirus causing extrahospital infections with light shape symptoms have adapted well to people.
On the other hand, it may be people who adapted well to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors after the pandemic of human coronavirus in the past.
Human coronavirus causing severe diseases in people, and people who have human coronavirus cause severe diseases simply have not survived.
For this to happen, human coronavirus must replicate in the human body enough to accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter the constraints of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people will be infected, the more chance that the virus is fully adapted to the person.
If he adapts well, his transmission among people will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infectious diseases control measures.
Over the years, four non-hospital coronavirus has been circulating among the population, causing common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not need a tank animal.
SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov and MERS-Cov have not adapted to a person well enough, and their transmission among people cannot be supported.
They need to preserve and multiply in their zoonous reservoirs and look for cases of getting into susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or reinforcing media.
SARS-Cov-2 has features like SARS-Cov / MERS-Cov and four HCov extrahospital viruses.
It is very easily transmitted like off-hospital HCov, at least currently.
But it's more pathogenic than off-hospital HCov, and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-Cov.
It remains to be seen if he adapts completely to human and whether it will circulate in a human environment without a tank or with an intermediate animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, enhancing and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary HCov carrier if it carries a close ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and unpathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the tank carrier has constantly moved HCov for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural HCoV carriers or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCov was only listed in the intermediate carrier right before or so when it was listed to a person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonous source of human infection and play the role of an intensifying carrier, allowing the virus to replicate the virus to replicate it to people, and then transmit to people, increasing the scale of infected people.
HCoV can move a dead end if it can't stand the transmission inside the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long endemic.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that zero patient SARS had contact with hunting animals (wild).
Further studies of seroprevalence showed that animal traffickers have igG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus is higher than the general population.
Himalayan cyvetes (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in the live animal markets became the first installed carriers of viruses like and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all the quotes in markets, SARS was no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that Himalayan quotes living in nature or on farms that did not enter markets, in most cases SARS-CoV was not defined, which allows to conclude that Himalayan civilians could only serve as an intermediate amplifier, but not natural tank SARS-Cov.
It is remarkable that since 80 % of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the probability that intermediate amplifiers can also serve many types of small mammals.
All of them seem to be impasse carriers of the SARS-Cov virus.
The subsequent search for the natural animal-Cov discovered a close cov bats, which was called the associated with atypical pneumonia of horseshoe bats HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3) and which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice are positive for SARS-Cov antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronavirus of bats have 88-92 % the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-Cov.
These research laid the foundations of a new concept that bats have become the carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-Cov) were also identified in bats, but none of them, which is designated by WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
SARS-Cov receptor is known to be human angiotenzine-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, obtained from the test of the faeces of bats, uses ACE2 bats, quotes and human as a receptor to enter the cage.
It is interesting that serums of recovery patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 presents SARS-Cov's closest ancestor in bats, sharing 95 % of nucleotide sequences homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent SARS-Cov virus, and bats are not a direct SARS-CoV reservoir.
Philogenetic analysis refers to MERS-CoV to the same group as Cov-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same receptor of the carrier, Dipeptidase-4 (DPP4) to infiltrate viruses.
The sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-Cov virus is phylogenetically closer to the betacoronavirus sequences of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, the wild bats have not found a live MERS-Cov virus.
MERS-CoV's homology and its closest relative Cov-HKU25 coincides only 87 %.
That is, bats may not have been a direct tank carrier of the MERS-Cov virus.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East showed that single-mountain camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as the camels of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-Cov, identical to the virus found in people, has been allocated from the nazal of single-mountain camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true MERS-Cov reservoir carriers.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected by MERS-Cov have minor symptoms, but a massive virus.
It is remarkable that infected camels have allocated the virus not only respiratory path, but also a fecal way, which is also the main way of allocating the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome did not have any contact with camels before symptoms and are believable to human transmission or transmission of unknown channels including unidentified animal species that are MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology coincides with Cov RaTG13 of bats allocated from the Asian horseshoe Rhinolophus affinis.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov, the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too big to attribute their parent relationship.
That is, bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical coronavirus of bats are found in the future.
SARS-CoV-2 direct animals are supposed to be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, with many initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates the likely transmission from an animal to a man.
Several recent studies on the basis of metagenomic sequencing found that a group of endangered by small mammammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica), could also carry parental betacoronavirus, the SARS-Cov-Cov-2.
The homology of nucleotide sequences of these new genomes of coronavirus of pangolin is 85-92 % coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also close to RaTG13, with identity at nucleotide sequences being around 90 %.
They are clustered in two authentic differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in a philogenetic tree, one of which has a domains (RSARS-CoV-2 with the identity of amino acid sequence. %.
Quite the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more divergent despite higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
An earlier study of sick pangolins also reported on the definition of viral contigs in lung samples, which were similar related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other assembly and manual processing methods to obtain a genome sequence, including about 86,3 % of full-size viral genome.
It is impossible to rule out the possibility that pangolin became one of the intermediate SARS-CoV-2. carrier animals.
However, due to the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and the Pangolin betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov-2. pangolin-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals have not yet been installed.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolins, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 has the highest homology of sequences in the whole genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of likeness between pangolin betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is for a recombination between the betacoronavirus of pangolin, the SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronavirus.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonous origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high-pathogenic viruses HCov, HCov-229 E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63and HCoV-229 E can come from coronavirus, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It was reported that the coronavirus of bats, named ARCoV. 2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and discovered in the North American three-color suckle, demonstrates close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229 E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was suspicion that its intermediate carrier could be camel.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of famous coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and table 2.
Philogenetic analysis gave evidence of the events of HCoV interspecies transmission in anamnesis.
When there was an interspecies transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus and people infected with pets, a respiratory infection pandemic was registered.
The history of HCoV-229 E interspecies transmission is not so clear.
Alfacoronavirus of bats, close HCov-229 E were found.
There is an alphaca alphaca alphaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to a person.
First of all, people, not alpacas, could contact with bats in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, alphaco-coronavirus, HCoV-229 E, bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while alphaca alpaca caused a seizure of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaca alphaca has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, it is impossible to rule out the probability that alpacas received an alphcoronavirus, a relative HCoV-229 E, from people.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit to HCoV-229 E to people.
On the other hand, while the alphacronavirus of bats could serve as a genetic pool of the HCoV-229 E virus, alpacas and single-mountain camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to people, just like in the MERS-Cov virus.
MERS-Cov serves as a great example of interview transmission from bats to single-hump camels and from single-mountain camels to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-Cov virus from bats is known by its original identification and was then confirmed by subsequent research.
Apparently, bats give a rich pool of viruses for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats "perfect distributors".
On the other hand, the MERS-Cov virus was introduced to one-hump camels a decade ago.
He adapted well to these camels, which from the intermediate carrier turned into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
These animals have the MERS-Cov virus causing a very lung disease and characterized by relatively low frequency of mutations.
His episode show to man is an accident and the man remains a dead end of MERS-CoV as his transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-Cov, the role of pangolins, if any, in transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In particular, the betacoronavirus of pangolins are high-pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be the dead end carriers of betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as well as cyvettes in the case of SARS-Cov.
In future research, several possibilities of interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be confirmed or excluded from animals to human beings.
First of all, bats can be a tank carrier for the SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an environmental niche with bats thanks to coal mining or cutting these animals.
Secondly, pangolins can be one of the intermediate amplifying carriers, which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently hit.
People are infected with the virus through the cutting of mascara and eating wild animal meat.
It is quite possible that many animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, including pets.
Pets and wild animal examination on antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in the third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolins.
SARS-CoV-2 animal search continues.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, three main factors from viruses also contributed to crossing interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high speed of mutations in the replication of the RNA.
Compared to other viruses with the same-chain RNA, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately high" with an average frequency of replacement of approximately 10-4 replacement per year on one section 2, depending on the coronavirus adaptation phase to new owners.
Coronavirus has a corrective exoribonucleasis that removing which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutating and weakening or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog of Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronavirus due to the inhibation of this exoribonucleasis and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2 that needs to be tested during clinical studies.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if coronavirus is not adapted enough to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation frequency, SARS-CoV-2 mutations is probably below, which shows higher adaptation to people.
This virus has already adapted to another carrier close to the person.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-Cov, well adapted to single-hump camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs quickly lose efficiency as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronavirus leads to more plastic in genomic modification for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species coevolution that is favorable for new coronavirus when appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by many unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3 '-end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to a unique matrix choice mechanism, coronavirus randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier that serves as a mixing vessel, it is often switched by threads.
High-homological full-size and subgenomic RNA can recombine and create new coronavirus.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination were found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronavirus such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Interaction of the virus-carrier regarding transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction with the carrier receptor.
This article also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events, SARS-CoV recombination.
Based on a comparative analysis between SARS-Cov strains of a person and civeti, it is believed that SARS-CoV is rapid adapted in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations on RSD S.
In general, RSD S coronavirus protein interacts with the cellular receptor, and the answer of the carrier intensively selects it.
SARS-CoV RSD is amino acids, from the 318th to 510, on a fragment of S1, which to introduce the virus into a cage is connected to the angiotenzyme of 2 (APF2) of a person, as well as its coreceptors.
SARS-CoV virus is able to recognize APF2 receptors of different animals, including bats, cyvetes, mice and raccoon dog, making it possible interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD that differ from human viral strains and civetes, with 4 of them are in a binding motive receptor to interact with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civetes has mutations of K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the affinity of interaction of the spike protein with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for adapting the virus to human.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-Cov.
The 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov in the S1 protein S protein segment leads to the linking affinity S to human APF2 could change.
Indeed, the study with cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this connection is 10-20 times higher than between the human APPF2 and the SARS-CoV protein.
It would also be interesting to determine if any other coreceptors are required for SARS-CoV-2. transmission.
Surprisingly, HCov-NL63 also connects to APF2, but another segment of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N aminopeptidase for HCoV-229 E and 9-O-acetylcial acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans after interspecies transmission from carrier animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of HCoV interspecies transmission is also controlled by other dependence factors and constraints of the carrier.
The divergence of these proteins between humans and HCoVs natural reservoir carriers, such as bats, single-mountain camels and rodents, can constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, HCoV viruses have to usurp the dependence factors and subordinate the factors of restriction of carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and carrier still need to be identified and categorized.
Good results can provide an impartial full-genome screening of dependence and restriction of carriers for SARS-Cov-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCoV emergence: back to zero mark
The variety of coronavirus bats creates wide opportunities for new HCoV.
In this sense, coronavirus of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force of HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, acquisition or loss of new genes coding protein has the potential for radical modification of virus phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins SARS-Cov is important for adapting to people is considered ORF 8, as the virus, SARS-CoV relatives were isolated, but it is found that they encoding ORF8.
A 29-nucleotide delegation characteristic of SARS-Cov was discovered in the beginning of the human epidemic.
This delegation breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF 8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites were identified in RNA-dependent RNA-dependent RNA.
Recombination localization has also been identified in non-structural protein nsp9, most nsp10 and nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the MERS-Cov epidemic has been subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-humid camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCov, where HCov recombined with other coronavirus animals in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial breeding can help unintentional changes in viral genomes, which is likely to be caused by relieving the virus from the breeding pressures, for example, from the media's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototypical HCoV-229 E prototype strain due to a two-nucleotide delegation.
While an intakable open frame of ORF4 can be observed in the viruses of the bat and camel, HCoV-229 E, alphaca alpaca alpaca alpaca one-nucleotide insert, leading to a shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.
In the infected of bats, the coronavirus, there were weak symptoms or lack of them, which indicates the mutual adaptation between coronavirus and bats.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically adapted to coronavirus.
For example, defects of activating the proinflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of murderer cells in bats is suppressed due to April of the inhibitory receptor of NKG2 / CD94 and low level of expression of the main compatibility compatibility compatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is provided by high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of coronavirus while at the same time affecting exoribonucleasis, thus creating a selection pressure to generating the virus strains that when infiltration into a new carrier.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains can also evolve due to recombination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is not by chance that three new coronavirus have appeared in the last twenty years.
Coronavirus is non-pathogenic or cause light symptoms in their tank carriers, such as bats or camels.
They confidently replicate without causing a strong immune response from the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Heavy symptoms are mostly associated with hyperactivation of immune response and cytokine storm, with the stronger the immune response, the more serious lung defeat.
On the contrary, asymptomatic carriers have immune response does not involve the replication of coronavirus.
The same strategy of non-binding immune response can have favourable effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Bats are especially strong interferon response.
Thus, taking type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, people should have a favorable effect.
In addition, the NLRP3 inflammasoma has been violated in bats.
On the basis of this, inhibitration of NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general scheme that SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov.
While a betacoronavirus of bats, the nucleotide homology of which is 95 % coincides with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of bats, which is a nucleotide homology of which coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civetes and other animals in the markets carry viruses identical to SARS-Cov, there were no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2
Pangolin betacoronavirus were found, astonishing homological SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of pangolin betacoronavirus genes could enter the final version of SARS-Cov-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentional or accidentally created by man.
Coronavirus attracted universal attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonous origin and HCoV tanks in human transmission.
Convincing evidence showed that SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and were handed over to the person through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and civettes in markets, the closure of the wild markets and destroying cycles on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the opening of various lines of betacoronavirus pangolins, close SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed to prevent zoonous transmission of infection from food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to people through pangolins and other mammals and how it can be the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-Cov virus has long existed in single-mountain camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS as it was done in China's wild animals markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop MERS periodic outbreaks, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop an effective MERS-Cov vaccine for camels combined with other infectious control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause disease outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonous coronavirus are circulating in the world.
In particular, the coronavirus of bats with zoonous potential are extremely diverse.
There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombining of these zoonosis coronavirus, which will lead to new coronavirus that are easier to transmitted and (or) more deadly for human beings.
In order to reduce the amount of excessive contacts between humans and animals, it is necessary to abandon the culture of wild animals in some areas of China.
After the harsh trials of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we need better readiness and plan to respond to such situations.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural tanks until the possibility of seize new territories.
Although many properties of bats are favorable for the spread of viruses, teaching people to stay away from them, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
A constant epidemiological surveillance of mammammals is needed to prevent the transmission of coronavirus and their natural carriers to humans and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to stay away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoose viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some fragments in the zoonous origin puzzle.
First of all, if bats handed over the ancestral virus to SARS-CoV-2 pangolins, it's interesting to see what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to a person, it is necessary to determine how people came into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate carrier is played by the third mammal, then you need to find out how it interacts with different kinds, including human, bats and pangolins.
Finally, as many mammals, including pets, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-Cov-2 or its predecessor viruses are expected to be identified in their natural carriers in the future.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
