COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have had contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or offered that are officially supported by the authorities.
Several versions of contact tracking apps have been developed.
This has led to a discussion about privacy issues, especially with regard to systems that rely on tracking the geographical location of app users.
Milder options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to register the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate support for such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by local it companies, is open source, and will be transferred to government control. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-enabled app that helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides rapid communication with health authorities.
The app was jointly developed by the Ministry of communications and technology and the Ministry of health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracking app is in the final stages of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on the Singapore-based TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use an app with a geozoning function, the purpose of which is to make sure that patients diagnosed with COVID — 19 who live in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of security engineering, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can occur with application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiency if only a small portion of the population uses the application.
Given concerns about the proliferation of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related apps in the App Store to include only "official" or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question has been raised about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to fight the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat disappears.
Amnesty international and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Organizations have announced eight conditions that they impose on public projects:
surveillance must be " lawful, necessary and proportionate»;
the extension of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by a time limit clause;
the use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected, and evidence of such security must be provided;
digital surveillance should avoid cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties must be defined at the level of legislation;
protection from abuse must be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
there should be "meaningful participation" of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and representatives of marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to solve the problem of constant surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download the app and avoid being tracked.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions, which have access to the original data on the location, also have large potential problems with confidentiality.
However, not all systems with Central servers must have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been developed that use Central servers only for communication (see the section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use apps as the basis for tracking contacts was used.
Instead of using a special app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected individuals, but also made location information publicly available, which was made possible by significant changes to information protection laws that were made after the mers outbreak in this country.
This information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and systems that preserve confidentiality.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been released.
Contact tracking that preserves confidentiality is an established concept with a significant amount of research literature Dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register a user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single Protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-preserving tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for privacy, mechanisms for tracking mobile contacts (PACT), and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures privacy when collecting and using location or intersection data to track COVID-19 distribution.
The work of this platform is based on the research presented in the document "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" ("Apps-bullies: how to maintain privacy during an epidemic"), published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to share confidential location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN global coalition was founded by groups that share the same approach and use similar protocols. its goal is to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and notification applications, which is a key factor in their wide distribution.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had opened the source code for BlueTrace used in its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve privacy.
They also published technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
deployment of tools that allow governments to create official applications to track the movement of citizens infected with coronavirus, but with data privacy preserved
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant surveillance by first implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Hand washing, also known as" hand hygiene", is the process of cleaning your hands to remove dirt, fat, micro – organisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.
A person can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as the flu or the common cold, for example, if they touch their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, you can clean your hands with ash. The world health organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after procedures for caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medications or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause diseases), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who are engaged in cooking or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Hand washing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, and reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
it also reduces the infant mortality rate for home births.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders about the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
A 48% reduction in the number of diarrhoea cases may be due to washing hands with soap. Washing your hands with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ARI), provided you develop appropriate habits in every home, school, and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, which claims the lives of approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia in General kill almost 3.5 million children every year.
The United Nations children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before meals and after the toilet, which has become a firm habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin, and, consequently, to its damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that washing your hands too often can lead to itching and peeling of the skin – a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the child's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating, and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where you should wash your hands to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or blowing your nose, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.
In many countries, the procedure of washing hands with soap is quite common.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of families use soap to wash their hands. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US in this list is closer to the middle, their figure is 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China-23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behavior and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hand washing for school children at a set time of day is one such methodology that helps to train children to this procedure.
The "emergency medical care program", implemented by the Ministry of education of the Philippines, is an example of large — scale measures to promote children's health and improve the level of education of children.
This national program is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoride.
The same program is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removing microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means for cleansing the skin, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollutants, are poorly soluble in water.
Sufficient water, however, contributes to the purification process.
Solid soap, due to its reusable use, may also contain bacteria that can get on it during previous use.
A small number of studies on the ingestion of bacteria on the skin from a contaminated piece of solid soap indicates a low probability of such ingestion, since the bacteria are washed off with foam.
The CDC still States that " liquid soap with a manual dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing."
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective with respect to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised one.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection products, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, lactic) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe Vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of public health showed that in terms of preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the skin of hands, simple varieties of soap are as effective as ordinary antibacterial soap containing triclosan.
Hot water at a comfortable temperature for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water for removing natural fats that keep out dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene product that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand hygiene products that do not contain water (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, antiseptic hand sanitizers, or sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these products are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers such as glycerine in liquid or foam form, providing ease of use of these products and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis Bacillus, as well as certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (3.5 logarithm reduction similar to 35 decibel reduction) on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% – 99.999% of bacteria (4-5 logarithm reduction) on hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent to thoroughly treat and saturate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The front and back of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel is completely absorbed.
The fingertips on both hands should also be thoroughly washed. The us centers for disease control and prevention recommends choosing to wash your hands rather than using disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily soiled.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not serve as a substitute for full-fledged hand washing, if you can use water and soap.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if their composition does not contain emollients and / or skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and (or) other emollients to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollient components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants, almost do not occur.
Lower probability of occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis is a key factor in the choice of sanitizers compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, products that do not contain water do not clean the hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as conventional soap and water, because when using such products, pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends largely on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, it has been proven that drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity in contrast to alcohol, which has been proven to lose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if the clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes in contact with water.
If soap is not available, who recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for disease control in the United States recommends using a hand-washing technique that includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended, because standing water can be contaminated, but the water temperature just does not matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that when using soap (and not just water alone), people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
RUB your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you RUB your hands, the more germs are removed.
Rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.
Rinsing your hands in standing water can cause repeated infection.
Dry your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.
Wet and wet hands are easier to get dirty. Most often, people leave out areas such as the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail Polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent the skin from drying out, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottle gourd with holes made, and / or using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as foot-operated taps and other low-cost options.
A tap with a foot pedal is a simple structure consisting of a container suspended from a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to allow water to flow on the hands; a bar of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on the production of paper napkins and towels; the subject of this study was a comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern stream air dryers for hands.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increases by an average of 194%, and on the palms – by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increases by 42%, and on the palms – by 15%.
After washing and drying your hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on your fingertips on average decreases to 76%, and on your palms-to 77%. The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether multiple toilet users and the toilet environment could be cross-infected with each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which releases air at stated speeds of 180 m / s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other users of the toilet room and bathroom within a radius of 2 meters.
Using hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
When using paper towels, no significant spread of microorganisms was detected. In 2005, the TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study for evaluating different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the hand drying method:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towel drying.
Cleaning your hands with disinfecting wipes can be an alternative solution when traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices really helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, and a large amount of soap, water, or gel is used to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing the fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying your hands, you should use a paper towel when turning off the tap and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This avoids repeated contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in medical facilities is to remove pathogens ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical settings: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the rate of bloodstream infections associated with catheter use by 66%. The world health organization has published a leaflet with an image of the standard hand washing and treatment procedure that should be applied in the health sector.
The draft who manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public comment.
The corresponding review was co-authored by Whitby.
If you need proof of compliance with regulatory requirements, you can use commercial devices to measure hand hygiene indicators and check hand hygiene.
The world health organization designates "five points" when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or body fluids,
before using an antiseptic, and
after patient care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap when washing hands ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before performing surgery or in an environment with a high content of antibiotic-resistant organisms. To" clean " your hands before surgery, you need a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with your hands; you should also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse your hands, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterile brush for rubbing, and other sterile tools for cleaning under your nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow usually within 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to RUB your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after procedures for caring for a sick person.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of hand washing benefits the most, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, washing hands with ordinary soap leads to more than three times the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. A comparison of wiping hands with alcohol-containing solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap, for an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that treating hands with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol solutions for hands, in terms of reducing the amount of influenza a H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Activities to promote hand hygiene in health care settings may include training staff in hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing hand solutions, and reminding staff in writing and verbally to wash their hands.
More research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as cost-effective and important for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a stable water supply, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to develop the habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by ingrained habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term changes in public behavior.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, it is necessary to conduct monitoring and evaluation of results.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-based health surveillance is effective in improving hand hygiene in lower-middle-income countries, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of advocacy for hand washing in schools is the Three Star Approach of the United Nations Children's Fund: it promotes simple, cost-effective measures in schools that encourage students to wash their hands with soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring that minimum standards are met, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The installation of handwashers is one of the possible measures implemented in the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce the level of morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, The United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of hand-washing emojis.
Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the DALYs indicator (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that encouraging hand washing with soap is a significantly more cost — effective solution compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals-was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and "the founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by putrid odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spread through the digestive tract and infections associated with medical care, the Centers for disease control and prevention in the United States began to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with "correct hand-washing techniques"were hung next to handwashers in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "wash your hands" means showing your unwillingness to accept responsibility for anything or to be a participant in anything.
It comes from the Bible, the gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ; this phrase later found wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, symbolizing a guilty conscience, in connection with the crimes that she herself committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed an unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than other people, and for them handwashers are more important.
It is also less likely that people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after what they saw will participate in any other "cleansing" compensating activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of a ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. The relig also prescribes hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe mandatory hand washing after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash your hands before and after each meal.
The 2019 outbreak of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: so far, more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and the number of infected people has exceeded 80,000.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but IT is much more contagious and affects older people more often than young people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications about a new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of a rapidly developing research subject.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, Virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of the further course and prevention of this disease.
Although answers to many questions have yet to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The spring festival (Chinese New year), which fell on January 25 in 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it, due to the outbreak of a new viral infection.
Given the high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the world health organization (who) named this virus SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the accompanying disease — coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country, and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
Who warns that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy for society" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, there have been more than 200 publications about COVID-19, including articles on its Virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report dated January 7, 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, the middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which had an outbreak in 2012.
We will also discuss the currently known facts about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been classified as pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause about 15 % of common respiratory diseases.4
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with appalling levels of disease severity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in the history of mankind.
As shown in figure 1.1, clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the national health Commission of the people's Republic of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal accident was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of health workers, which suggested the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus.
On January 23, a quarantine was imposed in Wuhan, and the city's public transport stopped working.
On January 24, according to the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, who announced that the coronavirus outbreak is a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing this report, the disease has spread throughout China and has already spread to approximately 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, the following updated picture of the epidemic was presented based on the results of a multicenter clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
All age groups were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but mostly people aged 30 to 65 years were affected.
Almost half (47.7 %) of those infected were over 50, very few were under 20,and only 14 were under 10.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is higher in men (0.31/100,000) than in women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed in clusters mainly in Hubei province and surrounding regions.
On average, it took 5 (2-9) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
From the onset of symptoms to death, an average of 9.5 (4.8–13) days passed.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51–4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23–4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected people, coinciding with large-scale transport on the eve of the Chinese New year celebration.
The mortality rate among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44 % (95% CI: 1.10–1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 — 4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (≥60), and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large envelope viruses containing a single strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and Delta, of which alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans.
In the case of damage by SARS and MERS-type coronaviruses, the glycoprotein of the sheath spines (S) binds to the cell receptors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence appeared on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, the genome of which is 99.98% the same as 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak site, at the huangan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrathin sections of human respiratory epithelium.
It was found that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binds to the human ACE2 enzyme less strongly than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus protein orf3b may play some role in terms of virus pathogenicity and inhibit Ifnß expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of a full-size human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 Å in combination with the b0at1 amino acid Transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, is assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence for recognizing and infecting coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans via civet and camels, respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was determined that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96 % identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely the bat coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate host through which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the path of transmission is also yet to be determined.
Mr. JI (Ji) and colleagues suggested that the virus was transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which resulted in homologous recombination in the S-protein.
Based on their research, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou have suggested that pangolins — long — winged mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine-are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1% distributed between both genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to UV light and heat up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents can effectively block the virus activity, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There is currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4).4).
Typically, a virus that enters the host body is first recognized by the innate immune system through image-recognizing receptors (ORR), including lectin C-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is involved in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helper cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, hyperreaction of the immune system leads to the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario, lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
The probability of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted on average 3 days, with a variation of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study described above, based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
For health authorities it is very important to adjust the timing of introduced quarantine measures with the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period that will prevent the spread of the virus, those infected have asymptomatic.
A 14-day quarantine has become a common practice for people who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often a high fever, which may be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
In some patients, a week after the onset of the disease, shortness of breath and (or) hypoxia were observed.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and / or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus in order to make an early diagnosis, even if there are no pathologies in the chest images.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 found the following rates of symptom prevalence: 98 % - high fever, 76 % - dry cough, 55 % — shortness of breath and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected people.
Comparable results were obtained in a 2012 study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98 %), dry cough (47 %) and shortness of breath (55 %).
However, 80 % of them required artificial ventilation, this figure is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher proportion of deaths from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26 %) and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high fever (99-100 %), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%), and artificial ventilation is required in 14-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2 %, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
In comparison, the SARS death rate by November 2002 was 10 % of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37 % out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Based on the results of an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71–7.23, whereas R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptom expression, mortality rate, and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with the new virus is lower compared to the latter two.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the mers-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestation often occurs when an infection occurs within the same family or group of people gathered together for some reason or found themselves together on some transport, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or had contact with infected or sick people in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, according to the data presented in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, after being discharged from the hospital, can again become carriers of the virus, and this is a Wake-up call to extend the period of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia with a white blood cell level < 4×109/L, including a white blood cell level < 1×109/L, as well as elevated asparagine aminotransferase and virosemia.
Elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin were found in the blood of some patients, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposition.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, a product of the breakdown of fibrin present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
In the majority of patients with COVID-19, chest x-ray examination revealed pathologies characterized by uneven darkening on both sides or "frosted glass" - type darkening in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory disease (ARI).
With the development of ARI, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant violation of gas exchange.
Dysfunction of pneumocyte types I and II lowers the level of surfactants and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Thus, the worst results of radiographic examination often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocyte detachment, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, and multicore syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ARI and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The method of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase PCR) was used as the main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19.
However, given the high level of false negative results that can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, since February 13, 2020, China has begun to make a diagnosis based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on reverse transcriptase PCR).
Similar was the situation with the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data from the medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and results of radiographic research.
On February 14, 2020, a team led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the Protocol for applying the SHERLOCK technique based on crispr repeat to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the detection of synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 20 × 10-18 mol/l to 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microliter of the original sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and the convenience of conducting them.
Due to the lack of experience in dealing with a previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can generally provide patients with COVID-19 only with supportive therapy, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (table (table 2).2).
These therapies include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immune suppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
For treatment, it was proposed to use even the plasma of recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and may also affect other organs that Express ACE2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and malfunction are the main threat and cause of death for patients.
Thus, to alleviate symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support respiratory function, including General oxygen therapy, high oxygen delivery, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo), a modified extrapulmonary circulation technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining the water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are critical for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine storm is a consequence of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFa, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNa, Ifnß, ifny, and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immune cells to release of huge amounts of free radicals, which become the main reason for the development of acute respiratory infections and multiple organ failure.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in serious condition, the suppression of the immune system is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that serve as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat cytokine storm.
Other methods of treating cytokine storm based on immune suppression include modulating the immune response aimed at controlling T cells; blocking the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of Janus kinase; the use of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histone acetalase inhibitors.
To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immune suppressants.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in the treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including mers and SARS viruses.
Relying on this data, Gilead has provided this drug to China for paired studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
You should carefully monitor the interaction of these drugs with other medications prescribed to patients.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
Blood collection from patients who have been cured of a contagious disease, to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population has been used for a very long time.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are present in the immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, in order to suggest mass application of this method before specific therapy, it is necessary to have not yet carried out a check and not compiled explanations.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, some disadvantages associated with the use of plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given the toxicity, is potentially life-threatening.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma for the treatment of patients in critical condition requires a lot.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies, or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical virus proteins.
This way we can go straight to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness largely depends on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, since it is difficult to identify and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific covid-19 therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods for treating patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest percentage of recovered patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces in China where Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87 % of patients, including Gansu (63.7 %), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rough comparison, since the assessment must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively based on Western medicine and combined treatment based on Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time to normalize body temperature, eliminate symptoms and provide medical care in a hospital was significantly less in patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients who were treated only using Western methods.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients whose symptoms started to worsen (from mild to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only with Western methods (7.4 % compared to 46.2 %), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled research conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of particular interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and explain aspects of the effectiveness of components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques, or a combination of them.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly experience a strong fear of an acute and even fatal disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS virus outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses have been reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt related to the spread of infection, quarantine, and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and who have come into contact with them, as well as to all other people who require IT.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary mental health teams should be formed, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the chain of transmission from animal carriers and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been carried out to create s-protein-based vaccines that aim to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses have been developed in animal studies.
However, before starting clinical studies, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in vivo when used in age-related patients, the model of infection with lethal doses, and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS virus disease continue to occur, originating in the middle East and spreading to other regions due to the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein elements have been developed to combat MERS, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (on average 18 months) required for the development of a vaccine, and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients manage to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a predictive model of the disease in order to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on the data of clinical studies presented to date, the following factors may affect the prognosis of the disease in patients with COVID-19 or be associated with IT (table (table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor in predicting the course of disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65 years, 47.7 % of whom are over 50 years old, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and they were significantly older than those patients who did not require such therapy (on average, 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in men than in women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can distort results.
Deviations detected in laboratory tests: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to consider it as a potential predictor of the course of the disease, reaction to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested to take into account the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the prognosis for COVID-19.
In addition, increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase, and creatine kinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, you should take into account the data of chest x-ray examination and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immune suppressants that are widely used in infectious diseases as an adjunct therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if it is necessary to use steroids for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty, and witness the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
To relieve stress in these patients and help them return to normal life, they must be provided with psychological counseling and long-term support.
According to demographic studies conducted to date, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to differ in its characteristics from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who are at an early stage of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period can, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, which significantly complicates epidemiological control.
However, it was believed that SARS-CoV virus transmission occurs when patients are seriously ill, although in most cases, early infection did not occur.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
A lot of work is currently underway in China, which has declared a General quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as extended the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, introduced in order to break the chain of distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures are causing huge damage to the economy and other areas of life in the country, the number of new patients detected is decreasing, which indicates that the spread of the epidemic is slowing down.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of attenuation will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues calculated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini have created a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in nasal and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current strategies may have had an effect.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola was expected to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infecting capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the feces, which means that oral-fecal transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in a hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical staff.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues, and even outsiders who come into contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; both surgical masks and class N95 respirators (series no.1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent micro droplets of liquid from potentially infected people from flying in the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only class N95 masks (series no. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions between 10 and 80 nm in size, they pass only 5% of virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, medical professionals in direct contact with patients must wear class N95 masks (series no.1860s), not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical professionals should wear a tailored protective coat to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical professionals should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type safety glasses.
The entire population in affected or potentially threatened regions is strongly encouraged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectants, try not to leave the house, observe self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high degree of its similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a Wake-up call for China, taking into account the experience it acquired during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after January 19, 2020, the Director Of the center for disease control in Wuhan reassured citizens that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproduction in human-to-human transmission, and that preventing the spread and controlling the disease will not be a problem.
This announcement significantly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing to celebrate Chinese New year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within the city of Wuhan with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since every word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics, rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic at an early stage of its development, rather than reassure the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly check and improve the public response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by a previously unexplored severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, has spread to 50 countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 outbreak felt like a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and the death rate among older people is also higher than among young people.
The mortality rate from SARS is higher than for COVID-19 (10.91 % compared to 1.44 %).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even if the disease is asymptomatic, whereas patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some patients with COVID-19, normal tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be negative.
On the other hand, cured patients may again show positive tests for the virus.
All this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the background of such rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite finding a 96 percent homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred from bats.
What animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any time.
Molecular-level simulations and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and provoke subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during transmission from person to person?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it periodically relapse like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but, whatever the cost, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the world health organization (who) stated that it does not expect that a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus will be available earlier than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investment in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main goals of the platform included in the phase I security studies:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 more candidate vaccines have been announced, but there is little publicly available information on them (presumably at the planning or development stage).
In stages I-II, preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing is performed, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing disease and at the same time, side effects are monitored at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still at the preclinical research stage).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
January 24, 2020 international vaccine center (VIDO-InterVac) The University of Saskatchewan, Canada, has announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the goal of starting human testing in 2021.
The launch of vaccine development projects was also announced at the Chinese center for disease control and prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced that they were starting work on their vaccine.
Janssen is working with its biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.

On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used for vaccination against the cancer neoantigen.
On March 25, the head of the research Institute announced the completion of work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the beginning of trials.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop a Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate drug that could be tested on humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States army medical research and materiel Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter reed army research Institute, silver spring, both located in Western Maryland, announced that they were developing their own vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
for vaccine development and production.
The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical trials and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even at an accelerated rate, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec, reported that they had created a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for health research.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald trump offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162 is a candidate for an mRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials, and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate drug could begin testing in humans as early as the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for innovation in epidemic preparedness (CEPI), France, announced an investment of us $ 4.9 million in a consortium to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI's total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is us $ 29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners in developing the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, and the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford, and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the canadian government announced C $ 275 million to Fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs at canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the canadian government announced a C $ 192 million allocation specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to create a national "vaccine Bank" that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh school of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that "MNA administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines, eliciting strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that manifested 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the canadian school of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be available in the form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three us universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages in addition to properties for the prevention of diseases.
Another randomized study, which is being conducted in Australia, covers 4,170 health care workers.
It is possible that the developed vaccines will be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models that are characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, indicate the need for infection containment measures with biosecurity level 3 in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines available to treat SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the study of SARS that was being conducted at that time could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) mers vaccine that had passed phase I of human clinical trials, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector – based vaccines and were in development, two were adenoviral (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA – vector (MVA-MERS-S).
A conspiracy theory was spreading on social media, claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that a vaccine for IT already existed.
Social media posts quoted some patients who claimed to have patents on the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as on vaccines for these strains.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as the entry point to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the n-terminal peptidase domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid collectrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, its enzymatically active domain reaches the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
THE extracellular ace2 domain is split off from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II lung alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA biosynthesis is also found in the cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, cleaves the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid Transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike to the ace2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme to endosomes located inside cells.
This entry process also requires priming of the s protein by the serine protease of the TMPRSS2 carrier, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to believe that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many of the professional community and regulatory authorities will be advised to continue standard therapy with ACE inhibitors and ARBS.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of Contracting pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients at General risk of pneumonia."
It is assumed that recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is an innovation in therapy for acute lung injuries and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure of 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people who are intolerant to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Introduced rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome‑2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The death rate in China is 4%, while in the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping a distance between people, and identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls, and closing various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of goods, compounded by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people who resemble them in appearance, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of the virus have been reported.
As a result of reduced travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (capital of Hubei province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation of the situation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases of infection were mainly associated with the wholesale seafood market of huangan, so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. This is a newly discovered virus that bears a strong resemblance to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, a publication in the South China morning Post newspaper, whose information has not been verified, suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, who reported that the number of new infections occurring in China has decreased, but has unexpectedly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside of China has exceeded the number of new infections in China itself for the first time.
The number of cases of the disease may be significantly underestimated, in particular, due to the number of cases with mild symptoms.
By February 26, there were relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients who are 19 years old or younger accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. The chief scientific adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population will be infected before the formation of effective group immunity in the country's population.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who were tested for COVID-19, and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, have adopted official policies that prohibit testing for only minor symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China before January 23, and that such unregistered patients were the source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive infection rate (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for disease control and prevention suggests that this figure may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 recover safely.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death was from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period — 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of those who died had comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic usually includes information about the deaths of patients who tested positive for COVID in accordance with official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official figures may not take into account deceased people who did not pass the test — for example, in cases of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official figures for COVID by 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual one." His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the United States. Such accounting with incomplete data is often found in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was registered in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside of Asia in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside of mainland China: in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary by region and time of disease spread; they are also affected by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and General health status. The "mortality / morbidity" coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases of infection during a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039 / 617,204).
Data for different regions are different.
In China, the mortality-to-morbidity ratio fell from 17.3% (for those who developed symptoms on January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those who developed symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of disease-related deaths (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the percentage of infection-related deaths (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain groups of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
The center for evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The upper figure in this range is consistent with the results of the first random test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
Who claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, a researcher at Penn state University, States that " uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to reach a plateau, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease runs out, they begin to go out.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will happen."
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, says that "everything can be over by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement who recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating for perhaps a year or two."
According to a study conducted by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine is created (perhaps 18 months or more)," physical distance measures and other measures will need to be followed.
William Schaffner, a fellow at Vanderbilt University believes: "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear for good, because it is so easily transmitted," and also that it "can turn into a seasonal disease, breaking out every year."
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum formation in the respiratory tract (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. Who says that is sick in a serious manner with the development of respiratory problems, about one in every six people.
The U.S. centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) lists urgent symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent pain or a feeling of chest compression, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips. If you have these symptoms, you should immediately seek medical attention. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
In some infected people, the disease may be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing people who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed, under strict control and examine for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic disease ranges from a few units to 44% of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. There is still no complete clarity on the symptom of loss of smell: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was initially 30%, and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small droplets released into the air along with coughing, sneezing, or during conversation; close contact refers to contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, when coughing openly, drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets thrown into the air during a conversation, which are able to stay in the air for a longer time. Respiratory droplets can also form when you exhale, including while talking, although the virus is not usually carried through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can result in the sputtering of exhalation products and therefore the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests were positive when tested three days before the onset of symptoms, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus before the symptoms are pronounced.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact-tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
Employees of the European center for disease prevention and control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus can survive on surfaces from a few hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus can live up to three days, on a cardboard surface — for one day, and on copper surfaces — up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. Domestic and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed using household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 bears a strong resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is assumed that it has a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the whole-genomic level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin and human viruses.
Holistic genomic comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) exists between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed based on symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the infected secret or computed tomography.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19".
Who has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, and the first one was published on January 17.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is performed.
It can be performed on respiratory tests and on blood samples.
The results are usually ready within a period of several hours to several days.
Usually a nasopharyngeal smear is used for the test, although a pharyngeal smear can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them were accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of symptom visualization on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral opacities like frosted glass and the absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian radiological society is responsible for compiling an international database of images of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to the similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, when identifying COVID-19, images that are not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study comparing chest CT results and PCR testing found that although images are less specific for infection, they can be decoded faster; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to diagnose the virus using radiographs and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining General personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using wipes when coughing or sneezing, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance yourself from people. Many governments recommend against any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak, and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among a population, some members of which do not know where or how they were infected. Medical professionals caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions for contact with other people and eye protection. Contact tracking is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
Governments 'use of citizens' location data using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have issued statements demanding that this type of surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile applications were developed and offered for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on developing solutions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data — for example, registering the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19, they will be notified accordingly. There are also baseless versions about how to prevent infection — for example, rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
At the moment, there is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on its creation.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC (Centers for disease control and prevention) also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when your hands are heavily soiled, and before eating, after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content.
Who recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (on a stainless steel surface, the disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 -7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day care facility, all spaces of SUCH a facility, including offices, restrooms, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with the back of your elbow or a napkin and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as using a mask can limit the volume and range of expiratory products that are dispersed in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
Who has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "using a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main method of infection." Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who may be infected.
Who recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using a mask does reduce the amount of face touching.
Several countries have started calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC centers in the United States recommend wearing non-medical fabric face masks. China has separately stressed the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask on public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are urging people to make facial tissue masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are forbidden to go outside without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the government of Vietnam asked all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered all grocery store visitors to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, which has produced ten million medical masks a day since mid-March, ordered all passengers on trains and intercity buses to use medical masks.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going out; those residents who cannot purchase masks were advised to sew them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping centers.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in regions particularly hard hit by the outbreak now prescribe or recommend social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can gather in one place, as recommended by US government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced, starting from 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gathering in groups that include more than two people. Older people and people suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of Contracting the virus in a serious form. The CDC recommends that they stay home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. At the end of March 2020 Who and other health authorities have begun to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", thus clarifying the purpose of this measure — to reduce physical contact within social networks, whether through virtual communication or by maintaining physical distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has been understood to mean that people should expose themselves to complete social isolation, instead of remaining in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during a pandemic.
Among others, recommendations were made to have sexual relations only with your regular partners, with whom you live, and in whom you are sure that they do not have the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are recommended to self-isolate at home.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas self-quarantine themselves.
Individuals in high-risk groups were placed under strict quarantine.
Individuals who may have come into contact with COVID-19 infected individuals, or who have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic, were advised to remain in quarantine for 14 days from the last possible contact.
Strategies to control the outbreak include curbing, suppressing, or mitigating the spread of the disease.
Containment of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate infected people, as well as involves other measures of infection control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At the stage when it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are directed towards mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Suppressing infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as leveling the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overstretched health services and allow more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the outbreak include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks, and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and canceling mass events; community involvement in promoting and participating in such measures; and environmental protection measures, such as surface cleaning. After the severity of the outbreak became apparent in China, more drastic actions were taken to contain the outbreak, such as isolating entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, as well as a notification system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected individuals who were self-isolated and heavy fines were imposed on those who did not.
In Taiwan, increased production of medical masks and fined for accumulating excess stocks of medicines. UK and US simulations have shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
An optimal policy to mitigate the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, and the death rate by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus is circulating in the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if this happens sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19 do not currently exist, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicine, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection, and respiratory support.
Using steroid medications can only do harm.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Who also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Who considers increasing the capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the main response to the outbreak.
The European center for disease prevention and control (ECDC) and the who regional office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to help reallocate resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating non-urgent procedures where possible, detecting the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and expanding intensive care options by training staff and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection might have occurred — the so-called "patient zero".
The first known case of infection with a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province gradually increased.
They were mainly associated with the wholesale huangan seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was registered in a clinic in Hubei province, with which a doctor, Zhang Tientsin, worked.on December 27, she reported this case to the Jianghan center for disease control and prevention in the city of Wuhan.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Central clinic in Wuhan warned their colleagues about a " SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, AI Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising a panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal health Commission issued a public notice and informed who of the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese new year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and major railway hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new infections in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy for the highest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million infections have been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people have died, and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The national response included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay at home, mandatory shelter at home, or isolation), as well as curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the validity of which has not been verified, this date is November 17.
On December 26, the doctor Zhang Jixian worked with a case of mass pneumonia of unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianghan center for disease control and prevention in Wuhan on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal health Commission issued a public notice.
Who was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese national health Commission claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of the newly discovered virus's ability to transmit from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later called the "people's war"by the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist party, XI Jinping.
The events of "the largest-scale quarantine in the history of mankind" began to unfold, on January 23, a cordon Sanitaire was announced and a ban on entry to and from Wuhan, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The city has banned the use of personal transport.
Chinese New year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.
The government also announced the construction of a temporary hospital Housegang, which was completed in 10 days.
Later was built another hospital, Leisegang who took other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed across the country.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced remote operation mode.
Travel restrictions were imposed in Hubei province and beyond.
Public transport schedules were changed, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, the movement of citizens has been controlled, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have experienced some form of outdoor movement restrictions. After the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the" import " of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, only one case of domestic transmission had been reported in mainland China, which had occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been largely stopped, and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei other than Wuhan were lifted, two months after the province was closed for quarantine. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of foreign Affairs announced that entry for visa or residence holders will be suspended from March 28. The exact time frame for canceling this order was not given.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on businesses and factories to resume operations and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On April 4, at 10:00, a national three-minute "minute of silence" was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the holiday of Kuinmin, but the Central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, observing physical distance to avoid a repeat of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Ministry of health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheongji in Daegu.
Shinchonji's followers came to Daegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, out of 9,336 followers of the Church, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease. On February 23, 2020, the highest alert level was declared in South Korea.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were registered in Korea, and on February 29, this figure increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed the presence of the virus in three soldiers.
The outbreak affected the number of trips, therefore, the airline's flight schedule was changed. South Korea has launched a program to screen the population for the presence of the virus, track contacts and organize quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization in the world.
Screening methods included mandatory notification of their symptoms via a mobile app by all those who came from abroad, universal testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, as well as the expansion of testing capabilities, which allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated there. Initially, South Korean society was divided over President moon Jae-In's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. moon to be impeached for what they considered the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases of infection in a single day for four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, 121 countries asked South Korea for help in testing for the virus on April 1.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where two people died later in the day, according to the Ministry of health and medical education.
The first measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to restrict intercity travel, but heavy traffic between cities continued before the Persian New year.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the virus's spread after China in February.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28, more than a dozen countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there may be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on March 3, tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, human rights watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as temporarily release all prisoners who fit this category.
The organization States that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day — the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
By March 23, 50 new cases of coronavirus were reported every hour in Iran and one new death from coronavirus every ten minutes.
According to the who representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country's financial capabilities in terms of protection from the spread of the virus.
The UN high Commissioner for human rights has demanded easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered the territory of Italy, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, made in Rome.
The number of cases of infection has grown rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Later, an unassociated cluster of COVID-19 infection cases was discovered. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-a law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in Northern Italy were quarantined.
The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte said: "The entrance to and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
Businesses have already been ordered to suspend operations and cancel sporting events in these areas." On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 people had already been reported dead in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie a football matches, were supposed to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of anaesthesia, analgesia, resuscitation and intensive care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for prioritizing patient care that may have to be used.
On March 19, Italy overtook China in terms of coronavirus deaths, ranking first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of these cases concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that a combination of two factors may contribute to such a high death rate in Italy — the large number of elderly citizens of this country and the lack of opportunity to examine all those who are currently sick with coronavirus.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus most calmly of all the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously enough to the danger facing the country's population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising against all travel and social contacts that are not of primary importance, suggesting that people work from home whenever possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment venues, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of wages, but no more than £ 2,500 a month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced tougher measures for social distancing, banning gatherings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to cases of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with the exception of businesses that provide "life support for the population", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington, a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15 was confirmed to have the first case of COVID-19 in the country.
On January 29, the white house created A task force to combat coronavirus.
On January 31, the trump administration declared a state of emergency in the public health sector and imposed entry restrictions on visitors from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for disease control and prevention, the U.S. government's leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result, the true extent of the outbreak during this period was hidden.

Who has included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Subsequently, Gilead scientists discovered that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of Filo -, pneumo -, paramixo - and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Currently several clinical trials, including two held University hospitals of Cleveland; one carried out on patients with a moderate form of the disease, and the other on patients with more severe form.
Currently, there are three clinical trials for intravenous administration of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).

Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
The control of occupational factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the application of occupational safety and health practices in order to control the risk and control the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Proper risk control in the workplace depends on the location and task at hand, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic situation in the community, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable due to COVID-19.
The U.S. occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) reported that lower-risk positions have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases, basic infection control measures are required, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home at signs of illness, observing respiratory etiquette, and conducting daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to become infected due to the current spread of the disease in the community or during international travel.
This category may include employees who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include airing with high-performance air filters, using protective screens, and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that employees of medical institutions and morgues who have come into contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are classified as high-risk; however, the risk increases to very high when such employees perform procedures involving aerosol formation, or collect/process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such employees include the use of engineering and technical safety equipment, such as rooms with negative pressure ventilation, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the relevant task.
A COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of workplace impacts.
Employees can be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to take care of other people, or due to fear of possible infection.
Commercial templates can change both with respect to the types of products that are in demand, and how to purchase such products (for example, making purchases during off-peak periods with delivery or service, without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be interruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. At the organization protection, you can use the Plan for preparedness to epidemics and carrying out responses.
The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors that occur at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual employees, such as old age or the presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also specify the controls needed to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for epidemic preparedness and response may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals for the response to the epidemic: reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations, and minimize negative consequences for other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is influenced by the severity of diseases in the community where the business is located.
A hierarchy of risk controls is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such controls according to their effectiveness.
If it is impossible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19 disease, engineering and technical security measures are most effective, followed by administrative measures and, finally, personal protection measures.
Security engineering means isolating employees from work-related risk areas and not relying on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes to work policies or procedures that require action from an employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but it can help to eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the threat to the employee, be suitable in size (for example, respirators), be used constantly and properly, be regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid infection.
The US occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) believes that positions with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, respect for respiratory etiquette, including covering your mouth with your hand when coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and trash containers, readiness for remote or shift work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Quickly identifying and isolating individuals who are potentially infected is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home for at least 24 hours until the fever, fever, and many other symptoms stop, without the use of antipyretics or other medications that eliminate symptoms.it also requires flexibility in sick leave policies, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring that employees are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the territory where the business is located, or due to recent trips of such person to COVID-19 distribution sites.
These categories include employees who have had contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some large retail stores. Engineering safety features for such groups and those at higher risk include installing high-performance air filters, increasing ventilation intensity, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic safety screens, and installing customer service Windows without exiting the vehicle. Administrative measures for this group and higher-risk groups include advising sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual means of communication, setting shift schedules, stopping non-critical travel to COVID-19 distribution sites, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum for answering employee concerns, providing up-to-date training for employees on COVID-19 risk factors and protective measures, training employees who need to use protective clothing and equipment in the correct use of such means, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, restricting access to to the workplace by customers and the public, placing information signs about the need to wash hands and other measures of protection from covid-19. Depending on the work tasks, employees with at least an average risk level may be required to wear personal protective equipment, including combinations including gloves, a robe, a screen or face mask, or protective glasses.
In rare cases, employees from this risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, measures such as isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to take care of the sick person, providing the sick person with a mask, or asking such a person to cover their nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing are required to ensure the proper safety of employees and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when coming into contact with bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, regular cough, or breathing difficulties.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and infected surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. In cases involving commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include delaying travel in case of illness, self-isolation, and immediately informing the ship's medical center if someone on Board has fever or other symptoms.
Ideally, the medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling trips for personal meetings, meetings, and other mass events such as physical education or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, adjusting arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
If there is a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for long-term non-attendance at school may be considered. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact people with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as those prescribed to emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during detention, employees must clean and disinfect their uniform belts and equipment before reuse with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures for preventing the spread of disease and disposing of used personal protective equipment, as well as for using and washing clothing.
OSHA believes that certain categories of health care and mortuary workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who are in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when they perform procedures involving aerosol formation, or when collecting / processing samples from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures involving aerosol formation include probing, cough-inducing procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures, and examinations or sample collection by invasive methods.
High-risk mortuary workers are those who process the bodies of people with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if they perform an autopsy, they are classified as very high-risk. Additional engineering and technical safety measures for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19, including during procedures involving aerosol formation.
In some health care facilities and morgues, the use of special negative pressure ventilation may be an effective measure.
Samples should be handled with the precautionary measures provided for biosecurity level 3.
The world health organization (who) recommends that incoming patients be assigned to separate waiting areas, depending on whether COVID-19 infection is suspected. In addition to other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for employees who interact up to 6 feet away with patients with a confirmed disease or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as for those who perform procedures involving aerosol formation.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved face respirators with an N95 filter or higher must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. Who does not recommend the use of protective clothing, because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by respiratory means, not through bodily fluids.
Who recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the point of patient admission.
Who recommends that people who collect airway samples from patients with COVID-19 or carriers of THIS disease without procedures involving the formation of aerosols wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or face shield, a dressing gown, and gloves.
When performing procedures involving aerosol formation, a N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the lack of availability of personal protective equipment worldwide, who recommends minimizing the need for such protection by using remote medicine capabilities, physical barriers such as transparent Windows, providing access to a COVID-19 infected patient only to those who provide direct care, using only those personal protective equipment that is necessary for a specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it when working with multiple patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and recommending that masks should not be used for those without symptoms.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the million-year milestone of infections worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million on Thursday.
The COVID-19 coronavirus has killed at least 52,000 people.
The milestone came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of death from coronavirus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries that had not recorded cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the world health organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10: 00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there were more than 244 thousand cases of coronavirus infection, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by a coronavirus infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the regime of self-isolation of city citizens until may 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favor of extending the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the Holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas previously the curfew only lasted from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 PM to 4 am.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the regime of home self-isolation on the territory of the state was extended by order until may 1.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) that is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are reduced to the manifestation of mild symptoms, but in some cases, the disease flows into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million infections have been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people have died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people recovered. The virus is mainly spread when people come into close contact with each other, often through microscopic droplets released into the air when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these drops are formed when exhaled, they usually pose a threat when they hit the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and in later stages. The standard diagnostic method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected diseases, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population vary: some agencies recommend not using them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six who regions.
Infected individuals may have no symptoms or have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent pain or tightness in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, or blueness of the face or lips; if any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention immediately.
Less often, you may experience symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat.
Also, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed in different percentages.
Some cases reported in China initially showed only a feeling of tightness in the chest and rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, multiple organ failure,and eventually death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days of infection. According to available data, not all infected people show symptoms.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is still completely unknown, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with an asymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; however, the Korean centers for disease control and prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
China's national health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily report on April 1; of the 166 cases of infection reported on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
When speaking loudly, more drops are released into the air than when speaking at normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore found that when coughing openly, drops can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
The virus is not usually transmitted by air, but the national Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and testing of air recycled by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can result in the sputtering of exhalation products and therefore the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through faeces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; it is possible to spread the virus before symptoms appear, but this risk is low.
Employees of the European center for disease prevention and control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus can survive on the surface from a few hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a cardboard surface, the virus can live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) — up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces — up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used correctly, have a fairly useful effect in terms of fighting infection: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and is also able to eliminate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. In the study, which was conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest content of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in related coronaviruses.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most affected by COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II lung alveolar cells.
The virus combines with ACE2 and penetrates the host cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein - "spike" (peplomer).
12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities, because they are involved in the work of this organ.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in the ICU with COVID-19, and may indicate unfavorable prognoses. Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that secrete IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
The autopsy also revealed lymphocytic infiltrates.
Who has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard testing method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained with a nasopharyngeal smear, but a nasal or sputum smear sample can also be used.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have managed to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop tests using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of this virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were under development, but have not yet been widely distributed.
The Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests has shown that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the US food and drug Administration (FDA) approved the first test for on-site diagnostics, giving permission for its use at the end of this month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by the zhunnan hospital of Wuhan University specify methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multi-lateral subpleural foci of "frosted glass" type compaction with peripheral, asymmetric and a posteriori distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, cobblestone symptom (lobular thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological examination performed at the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, congestion and edema of the lungs
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multinucleated giant cells
a severe form of pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that you cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or if you don't have a tissue, cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow area.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to perform a high-quality hand hygiene procedure.
The centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommends using fabric face masks in public places, in particular to limit transmission by individuals with an asymptomatic course of the disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and businesses have been closed, the movement of citizens has been restricted, and major public events have been canceled.
The distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19. Since the development of the vaccine is not expected to be completed until 2021, the main part of measures against the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "reaching the plateau".
The CDC also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when your hands are heavily soiled, as well as before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using an alcohol-based sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol content) to treat hands, but only when soap and water are not available. In regions where such disinfectants are not sold, who provides two formulations for local production.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen the immune system, it is recommended to follow the rules of personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supportive therapies may be indicated for patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Who and the national health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource — IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first-line medications, some medical professionals recommend opting for paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
When performing procedures that may involve airborne discharge, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical settings.
Medical professionals caring for people with COVID-19 are recommended by the CDC to be placed in an air-drop isolation unit (AIIR), an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. The CDC has published recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective coat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above products, it is preferable to use respirators, rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but when used outside of the instructions, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face screens or, as a last resort, making the masks yourself at home.
In most cases, COVID-19 forms are not severe enough to require artificial ventilation or its alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided by using a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods is as effective for patients in critical condition as a ventilator.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, because this method significantly restricts the spread of particles in the air compared to a nasal cannula with intense airflow. The risk of severe disease for older people (those over 60, and especially those over 80) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with a sharp increase in the number of severe cases of COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of patients were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation to support their lungs, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of providing artificial ventilation is becoming more difficult, as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops with COVID-19, and oxygenation cause more problems.
Ventilators with pressure-assisted inhalation and CPR are necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure that they are minimally damaged by ventilation, which can result in pneumothorax.
High MPC may not be available on earlier fan models.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
The most promising is ramdevpir.
The development of new drugs may take until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
Who-recommended volunteers participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary approval for the use of reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
Its use has not been subjected to clinical studies that should be conducted to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak.
To log in, users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect "close contact" using surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data Analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they have come into contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave security authorities permission to track the mobile phone data of people who are allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for individuals who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided aggregated data on the location of mobile subscribers to German Federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute.
In Russia, face recognition technology has been introduced to detect quarantine violators.
Italian regional health Commissioner Giulio gallera said that mobile network operators report that " 40% of people still continue to move around the territory."
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantines, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and well — being."
The disease may occur in a mild form with little or no symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Patients with a mild form of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while it may take three to six weeks to treat patients with severe or critical forms.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data for COVID-19 is not available. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In individuals with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.
Abnormalities of blood clot formation, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while impaired renal function was observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to studies of early-stage cases, the average time from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the national health Commission of China (NHC), the death rate among men was 2.8%, and among women — 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the national health Commission of China, heart problems were due to increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality, depending on the condition of the range due to such regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Insufficiently effective counting of mild cases can lead to an overestimation of the death rate.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers developed severe COVID-19 symptoms 1.4 times more often overall, and these patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who recovered from the disease had their lung volume reduced by 20-30%, and their scans revealed damage.
After recovery, this can also lead to "After intensive care"syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients who have recovered from the virus develop a strong immune system against it.
Based on the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but there have also been cases reported where tests for the coronavirus were still positive after recovery from COVID-19.
It is believed that in these cases, there was an aggravated prolonged course of the disease, and not a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin, and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date for the first case.
According to official data published by who, this date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of disease spread, and are also affected by the amount of testing, quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and General health.
At the end of 2019, who assigned ICD-10 emergency codes to the disease: U07. 1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID – 19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV - 2 infection. The ratio of deaths to cases of infection is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822/2240,191).
This figure varies from region to region. Some other methods include determining the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, and determining the infection-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have had an infection, the presence of such antibodies can tell how many people were infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) are already dead.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as SUCH.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, based on the indicators of donated blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to research conducted in China and Italy, the death rate is higher in men.
The most at — risk group is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women is narrowing only from the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender-specific immunological differences, lower Smoking prevalence among women, and concomitant diseases in men (for example, hypertension, which occurs in men at a younger age than in women) may cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not maintain gender statistics for COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS have different gender statistics.
The majority of health care workers, especially nursing staff, are women, so they are more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the world health organization announced the official name of this disease — COVID-19.
The head of who, Mr. Tedros Adanom Gebreisus, explains: "CO "means" crown"," VI "means " virus", " D "means" disease", and 19 is the year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (for example, China), animal species, or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, who additionally uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19".
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as" coronavirus "and"Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical places in names of diseases and viruses, who recommended using the terms "acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID – 19" and "SARS-CoV-2"were published.
Due to limitations in the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical supplies, such as nasal swabs and parts of ventilators.
In one of these cases, an Italian clinic urgently needed a vent valve, and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, so one of the local production facilities was repurposed and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
After the COVID-19 outbreak first broke out, various conspiracy theories, misinformation, and fake information about the origin of the virus, its scope, prevention, treatment, and other aspects began to spread rapidly on the Internet.
People can probably infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine for the virus or medication to treat it.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, who initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial program, which aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no ready-made vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing candidate drugs for the vaccine.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so research uses the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are aiming to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at triggering a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, creating a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies aim to destroy the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method for creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed for any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent amplification has been identified as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of these studies were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Repurposing antiviral drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. Several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered for the same purpose, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and lopinavir / ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving ramdevpir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the United States, China, and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and there are preliminary results.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition also list interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir as remedies against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies have shown that the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires priming of the spike protein by serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2).
Research on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without more detailed study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinemia properties. As a result of a small study conducted by the national health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug entered the 2nd stage of the non-randomized test, which is conducted at the national level in Italy, after positive results were obtained from its use in patients with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin test to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need THEM is currently considered a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tried in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results have been inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may also be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of convalescent blood serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against this virus, may be increased.

Stores in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were announced in ads at the checkout, as well as on the network's Facebook page.
As reported, citizens began to make emergency supplies due to fears that COVID-19 may lead to the introduction of a General self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths chain also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packages.
The Coles retail chain said in a press release on March 8 that with the four-pack limit being imposed, "many stores are still selling toilet paper too quickly — one delivery within an hour" and called such demand " unprecedented, "while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called the trend"unexpected."
According to a Woolworths representative, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited this amount to two packages.
To make up the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made inventory for a special early sale promotion on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian retailers Association, said retailers are trying to restock, but this is being hampered by local government restrictions on truck travel schedules.
He expects the cost of production to increase as suppliers try to meet demand, but fewer and fewer profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to inventory depletion, some stores cannot hold promotions on Wednesdays.
In the report News.com.au Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of technology, said stores were restocking every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky product, so the amount of inventory is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of lack of inventory.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and items like toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, shoppers probably wouldn't panic so much," says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported running out of stock.
According to the message News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a Kleenex toilet paper company, and Solaris Paper, which also produces Sorbent-branded products, said they are working around the clock to ensure enough products are available.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to a lack of buyers during the labor day holiday week, some real estate sellers began offering first-time bidders free toilet paper.
The Thursday edition of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
According to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of items purchased, saying they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, haberdashery, hand washing products and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening, it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.

TOPIC: [Covid-19] load Relief and preparation for the future
DATE/DISPATCH TIME: March 14, 2020, 00: 24 UTC
RESOLUTION: CC0: the Protected rights do not exist
We are living in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We observed a friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which was reflected in emails, calls and chats — a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, we have amazing people working with us.
It is with great gratitude and pride that I speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the high assessment of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure the health of sites, payment by our colleagues, or protecting the security of communities.
The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and this is even more important today than ever before.
At this time, in order to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in this process, we will be making important changes to the way we work together starting in the coming week.
Adjusting the order of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
During the conversation, we discussed our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back down, then so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
we expect to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are received.
We do not declare days off: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now; whatever your needs, whether it's taking care of your family, buying food, or going to a doctor's appointment, your well — being is our number one priority.
We don't monitor your working hours.
If you are ill, you should not work.
This is clear and indisputable, but we mention it.
No sick leave or time off is required: just inform your supervisor and help the team review their calendar and work schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Brian from the T&C Ops unit so that T & C can provide support and proper attention from management to your situation.)
Hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirm our intention to comply with our obligations to our contractors and employees with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you are unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in times like these.
Again, we are talking about self-help.
We ask that you communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support these types of activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to evaluate current goals and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work "twice as hard to catch up" after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What happens to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations in terms of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timing of our Annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to offer an extension for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize critical work, self-help, and caring for loved ones, while ensuring that everyone who needs or wants to work has a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension of deadlines can significantly reduce the current planning burden and stress across the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Board and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for leading this effort.
The condition of the office, the risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco may be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for reception rooms and Elevator halls that allow access to our floor.
The building has its own rules that dictate caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the district of Columbia (DC) is located in the network of WeWork, which shared with us and all staff located in DC its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the district of Columbia completely switched to remote work in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As you know some of our colleagues from new York, we also discussed the issue of renting the premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues who work remotely are aware of the possibility of correcting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
We recommend limiting the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider splitting them into a course of several days.
Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and send out materials for review in advance.
By default, use video communication, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.
For convenience, assign a coordinator-a person who will track the receipt of questions in the chat and control the list of speakers, as well as responsible for taking notes (or taking notes together).
If you need to use a convenient headset, contact technical support by email.
Take advantage of your Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.
Connect to the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team studies the ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as" editathons", until the who declares the end of the pandemic.
We understand and advise that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to carry out agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes to such goals.
In the coming week, we will hold follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The General mood in the global community is not only upset at the interruption, but also a certain sense of relief at the mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
In terms of perspectives, CRT is working on a page in the Meta-Wiki that will provide a space for the community to follow the impact and communication.
We remain in touch with questions related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC/07: 00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to share more relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting to each other.
We are together in this situation and are ready to help in any way we can.
However, you can still get information from such email correspondence, and other important information about COVID-19 from the Office Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages and all the information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about trips, events, key work flow, problems with information coverage, or if you need other assistance, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have any privacy concerns, please contact Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations, via email.
No such change should be considered as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and ensure that we can continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for important work to be done in the coming weeks and possibly months.
To make this happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and work as hard as possible as soon as the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published a short reference guide for the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information about our experience and provides verified recommendations for fighting this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment about our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the document "recommendations for diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19" (seventh version), issued by the national health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was named "severe acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
March 11, 2020 Who has classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication attracted a lot of attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven issues of the document "recommendations for diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19" published by the national health Committee of the people's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and the content of some of its provisions has changed significantly.
Recently in a paper prepared by Zhou (Zhou) with co-authors, comments were provided on our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as providing valuable background information on this worldwide pandemic.
We confirm the high significance of their work and Express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of the "recommendations for diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19" (trial seventh version) and the results of current research, and their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (dated March 3, 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming a case of suspected disease, it is necessary to combine one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or residence in and around Wuhan or other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs or from other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of individuals with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases of high fever or respiratory symptoms reported within 2 weeks of the onset of symptoms).small areas, such as a house or apartment, office, classroom at school, Etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
Diagnosis for a confirmed case should be based on a case of suspected disease with one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genome virus sequencing shows high homogeneity relative to new coronaviruses; (3) positive SEROTEST results for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in test result from negative to positive for SARS-specific-cov-2 IgG antibodies, or a titer increase of at least 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues of this document, a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples.
Pathogenetic diagnostics of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) issues; and then in the seventh issue, the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers searching for the optimal set for detecting nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for analyzing samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.
However, there is growing evidence of the need to exercise caution when treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without severe symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou) et al., should be updated, since it classifies people who do not have clinical symptoms as a "low risk"group.
The evaluation system also needs to be clarified in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to get more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of" suspected cases "and" confirmed cases", we encourage readers to monitor and strictly follow the latest recommendations that are given in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-a 19-day high
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 in a day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of epidemiology, disease control and research (IEDCR) reported that the number of reported cases of infection included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, iedcr Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina flora said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr Mirjabi, two of the deceased were aged over 60, two were aged between 51 and 60, and one was aged 41-50.
She also said that the two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the world health organization (who) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
An employee of the clinic told the local Anadolu news Agency that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Bengal anti-corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Maitri clinic in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of road transport and bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport operations would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport has been suspended since March 26 and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods-medicine, fuel, and food-was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have already recovered.
The world health organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the world health organization (who) announced a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the disease and not the risk of specific cases, who notes that national governments need to take action:
"All countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic."
This is possible if the country will be engaged in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation of cases, tracking cases of the disease, as well as the mobilization of its citizens", — said General Director of who, Mr. Tedros Aden Hebraicus.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction."
According to Dr Tom Frieden, former Director of the US Centers for disease control and prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus other than influenza has yet been tracked from its origin to its continuous global spread."
Mr. Gebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never observed of a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, who declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international significance, and then gave it a new status — a pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and infectious diseases of the United States, said of the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it will get worse."
According to the Associated Press, as of Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, and more than 4,600 people have died.
Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and intended only for detecting the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to go to the hospital, or were not present at all.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing opportunities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.
By March 23, no country had managed to test more than 3% of its population, and information about the number of tests conducted in different countries is very contradictory.
These differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on airway samples obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab or a sputum sample.
Results are usually available for a period of several hours to 2 days.
OTT-PCR test performed on swabs taken from the throat is only valid for the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, but still multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, alternatively, material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken using a suction catheter, or expectoration products (sputum) can be used.
An early PCR test was developed at the Charite clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the world health organization (who).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its own test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for detecting SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical-level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the "E" gene common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive permission from the national medicines administration of China for emergency use of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) distributes its real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource organization.
One in three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed on average throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and drug administration as part of an emergency authorization for use. Us commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were stated; sampling and processing of analyses must be performed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State research center for Virology and biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal service for healthcare supervision. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. on March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use a test that can be performed for 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing a single machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA had issued similar permits to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes, and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the US, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day. Currently, a test is being developed in Taiwan using a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of a new coronavirus, and it is hoped that results can be obtained in 15-20 minutes, similar to an Express flu test.
A March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that " chest x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] results may have this value even before symptoms appear."
Typical features detected during CT include bilateral multi-lobed subpleural foci of "frosted glass" type compaction with peripheral, asymmetric, and a posteriori distribution.
Subpleural dominance, cobblestone symptom, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using the PCR method for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity, and for the purpose of population control. Tests can be performed in Central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnostics (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses can be performed by high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the production speed of each such system.
CLT usually uses a single peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by puncturing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood sampling stage is not required for assay. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency authorization test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.
The performance of testing is several hundred samples within a few hours and, therefore, this method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody kits it had purchased gave satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with a suspected virus to stay at home: "emergency Department staff hand the patient a test tube for a sample," the patient spits into it, gives it back, and after a while receives the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it was used to transport a patient. During rapid testing for COVID-19 in suspicious cases, the medical professional takes the analysis, using all appropriate precautions.
Rapid testing centers have helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. On March 2 in Germany, the national Association of compulsory medical insurance doctors said it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient settings, whereas a week earlier they could only do 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the Institute's President, Robert Koch, Germany's overall performance in terms of testing is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct rapid testing in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, since only positive results are recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 tests were taken on SARS-CoV-2, up to and including week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive. Researchers at Israel's Technion and Rambam Hospital clinics have developed and tested a method for simultaneously testing samples taken from 64 patients, combining the samples and performing further tests only if the combined sample shows a positive result. In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory with an area of 2,000 square meters. an emergency detection team called " Huo-Yan "(Китай or" fire Eye " in Chinese), which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, there would have been 47% more cases of disease in Hubei, and consequently, the cost of quarantine would also have been twice as high.
After the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai — a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, daily throughput totals were 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex schemes of Origami Assays have been released that can test up to 1,122 patient analyses on COVID19 using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the lack and insufficient quantity of reagents, it became problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols that involve heating samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the amount of coronavirus testing that the United Arab Emirates currently conducts per capita is higher than that of any other country, and most of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the rapid testing capabilities, along with the acquisition of the mass population testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on Their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first laboratory on such a large scale operating outside of China.
Various testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The world health organization has adopted the German version of manufacturing test kits that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the Protocol developed by the United States centers for health and epidemiology was not available until January 28, which led to the lack of test kits in the United States. At the very beginning of the outbreak, China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were not able to provide enough kits recommended by health experts.
But in South Korea, experts say, the widespread availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has worked to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the world health organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many private laboratories in the United States, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of tests, were overloaded, and stocks of materials for sampling smears and chemicals were quickly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws", and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private development of tests. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results may be an unsuccessful sampling or incorrect use of kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw the kits that gave inaccurate results and replace them with other kits-those from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested dumping them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of health, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a "high error rate" and the Ministry "did not use them." The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, it was declared unusable.
Quarantine measures for individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of people with whom such patients came into contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where a person died from COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
The entrance to the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of infection.
With intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less stressful than in other developed countries, and it did not have to impose extreme restrictions such as forced restaurant and store closures.
Many events there were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began to urge residents to stay home, but schools whose holidays ended on March 23 opened as scheduled.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions were less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were performed compared to the number of deaths, the mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
Who recommends that countries that do not have the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative test results for COVID-19 to one of the 16 who control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following graph, the "% positive " column indicators depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result as a percentage compared to a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of whether there are symptoms of the virus, all other things being equal.
The rapidly growing cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU / European economic area and in the UK, thus confirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve their preparedness for the influx of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese center for disease control and prevention reported that the causative agent of the infection is a new type of coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been referred to as a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild form of the disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and the majority of those affected recover.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% it takes a critical form when intensive care is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 %.
This study analyzes trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU) / European economic area (EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the world health organization (who) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria used by who to determine the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on January 24, 2020 — all three cases returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 infections were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths recorded between December 31, 2019 and this date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 deaths, occurred in Italy alone.
Determining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European center for disease control and prevention (ECDC) updates data on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world every day at 8:00, obtained from official sources such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and who.
This data is used to analyze trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, a truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over 14 days was calculated, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8: 00 on March 15, 2020, compared with data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 development in the EU/EEA and in the UK
Trends in the development of a truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK generally corresponded to trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to increase around February 21, and on February 28, 2020, there was a sharp jump in THIS indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 were observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK (additional material).
For rice. 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK compared to the same figure for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as of 8:00 on March 15 in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, different responses by national public health authorities, and possibly different case recognition criteria and different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19 testing, including catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 % of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions are already as full as possible.
Currently, data on admissions of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU / EEA are only available for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not provided).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such data to Supplement current surveillance data on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios for modeling the resource utilization of health systems with estimated data on hospitalization of COVID-19 infected patients in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, when the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90 %.
Since cases are currently grouped by specific regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a specific territorial group, it is recommended that information about infections and the number of beds in intensive care units be provided, if possible, by level 2 of the territorial unit Nomenclature for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
The Italian experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a scenario of contact infection with SARS-CoV-2 that persists for a long time, and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who need medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which, for example, can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on rapid risk assessment results, a rapid, proactive and integrated approach is essential to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a subsequent shift from containment to minimization of consequences, because, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may not have enough time to think, take and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time to step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause a mild illness, such as the common cold.
Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Central China in late 2019 has again drawn attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmittivity, but less pronounced pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate carrier reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The identification of host animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals that carry coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their detection history, as well as their zoonotic origin and methods of interspecific transmission.
It is important to note that we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by a coronavirus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers and the influence of virus evolution on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with a single positive-polar RNA strand.
These viruses with the largest RNA-containing virus genome, containing from 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides, were named because of their shape, which when viewed under an electron microscope resembles a corona.
From the point of view of structure, coronaviruses contain a non-segmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, designated nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spiked protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of line-specific accessory proteins are also encoded in other coronavirus lines.
Based on differences in protein sequences,\ coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronaviruses), while the betacoronavirus species includes most human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and betacoronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecific barriers, and some of them have evolved to dangerous pathogens for humans.
Seven human coronaviruses are known to date.
These include the human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and type II severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and / or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory disease (ARI) and displaying extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first strand of Human hcov-229E coronavirus, B814, was obtained from a sample of nasal discharge from patients who had a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, thanks to extensive research, more detailed knowledge has been accumulated about The hcov-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that infection with human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most disastrous epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were sick, and the overall death rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
Discovered in 2019, a new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus infection epidemic (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 has claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of infected people has exceeded 91,000.
The alarm signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonotic origin, their sources being bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to which the viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but demonstrate a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented China and the world with a severe challenge from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will allow us to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecific transfer.
It may also prompt or speed up the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the re-spread of the disease in the future.
This review provides General information about the zoonotic origin, interspecific transmission, and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following General feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic for their reservoir carriers, but acquire a pathogenic character after interspecific transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the trend in the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which an increase in transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
The result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the b814 strain of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample released from the nasopharynx of patients with colds, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and visual summary of the history of detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966; this virus later adapted to reproduce in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, General malaise and sore throat, while high fever and cough were observed in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of sucker mice.
The clinical signs of infection with HCoV-OC43 virus look similar to the symptoms of infection with HCoV-229E virus, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza type a viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are ubiquitous in the world and are usually transmitted during the winter in temperate latitudes.
Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.
According to the results of a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the" SARS epidemic", was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in history, and the causative agent of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coronaviruses.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
Without taking into account overactive distributors, it was estimated that each case could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load occurred on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headaches, fever, General malaise, and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, coughing, and respiratory failure.
Common laboratory abnormalities in SARS include lymphopenia, abnormalities in liver samples, and elevated creatine kinase levels.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophage levels.
Approximately 20-30 % of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs may also be infected, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a huge effort has been devoted to research on human coronaviruses.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it mainly affects young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by such manifestations as runny nose, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it is actually widespread.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, with the peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with an exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All of these four human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation resulting in highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have occurred and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
These human coronaviruses usually become less virulent or pathogenic when they acquire the ability to be effectively transmitted and stored in the human body.
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the middle East, but imported cases have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia and spread through episodic secondary infections through close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, there are more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of middle East respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
In the period from mid-to late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, which is now, in retrospect, associated with an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The world health organization has declared that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed "coronavirus infection 19" (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, there are 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and outside of it — 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly turn into a syndrome of acute respiratory failure.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transmission capability compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, indicating that the virus can spread rapidly around the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and duration of the diseases they cause.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, in terms of severity of symptoms, COVID-19 is located between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly seen when infected with human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there are also interesting patterns that are characteristic of both human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent virus transfer (i.e., infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as it is in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is typical for human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmittance, pathogenicity, and sustained spread after passing through humans.
All four human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it is possible that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe diseases in humans, and people in whom human coronaviruses cause severe diseases, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate sufficiently in the human body to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract carrier restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission among humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired coronaviruses have been circulating in the population, causing common colds in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.
The highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be maintained.
They need to be preserved and propagated in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of getting into susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as community-acquired HCoV, at least for the time being.
But it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCVs, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt completely to humans and whether it will circulate in a human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate host animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it is useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying, and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir carrier constantly transfers HCoV over time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced to an intermediate host just before or around the time it was introduced to a person, it was not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host, allowing the virus to replicate at lightning speed, and then transmitting it to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can carry a dead-end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside an intermediate carrier.
In contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with game animals.
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus compared to the General population.
The Himalayan civet (Paguma larvata)and raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that SARS cases were no longer reported after all civets were destroyed in the markets.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not entering markets, in most cases, SARS-CoV was not determined, which leads to the conclusion that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate reinforcing carrier, and not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is possible that numerous species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplifying carriers.
They all seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for a natural animal carrier of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, which was named the SARS-related horseshoe bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the Foundation for a new concept that bats became carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none of them, except for one designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, obtained from a bat fecal sample, has been shown to use BAT, civet, and human ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry.
Curiously, the serums of recovering patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent of the SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis places MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 in bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptildipeptidase-4 (DPP4), for virus penetration.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to sequences from bat betacoronaviruses identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live mers-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 in bats matches only by 87%.
That is, bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the middle East have shown that single-humped camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from nasal smears of single-humped camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV showed minor symptoms, but massive viral release.
It is noteworthy that infected camels isolated the virus not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus isolation in bats.
However, questions still remain, as many confirmed cases of middle East respiratory syndrome have no history of contact with camels before symptoms occur and are plausibly attributed to human-to-human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unidentified animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides is 96.2% the same as the ratg13 CoV of bats isolated from the Asian horseshoe beetle Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parent relationship to them.
That is, bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless nearly identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
Presumably, direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which has been associated with many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely case of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also have carried a parent betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new genomes of the pangolin coronavirus is 85-92% the same as SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the level of nucleotide sequences of about 90%.
They cluster into two sub-lines of virus differentiation similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
Quite the contrary, the RSDS of the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
An earlier study of patients with pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other Assembly and manual processing methods to produce a genome sequence that includes about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It is possible that pangolin became one of the intermediate carrier animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of similarity between the pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favours recombination between the pangolin betacoronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no definitive decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of hcov-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses of the hcov-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American tricolored sucker, shows close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that its intermediate carrier could also be camels.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of a history of interspecific HCoV transmission events.
When interspecific transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred around 1890 and people became infected from Pets, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecific transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Bat alphacoronaviruses closely related to HCoV-229E were found.
Between them is the Alpaca alphacoronavirus.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who were able to contact bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while Alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpaca alphacoronavirus was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, it is not impossible to exclude the possibility that alpacas received an alphacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses could serve as a gene pool for the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and single-humped camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecific transmission from bats to one-humped camels and from one-humped camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its initial identification and has since been confirmed by subsequent studies.
Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecific exchange of gene fragments and interspecific transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats "ideal propagators."
On the other hand, THE mers-CoV virus was introduced to single-humped camels decades ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.
Its episodic transmission to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dead-end mers-CoV carrier, since its transmission is not supported.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, betacoronaviruses of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be dead-end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities of interspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans should be confirmed or excluded.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an ecological niche with bats through coal mining or butchering the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifying carriers that the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.
People are infected with the virus through butchering and eating wild animal meat.
It is possible that many animals, including Pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Testing of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Third, as indicated above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third species that came in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of host animals, three main factors on the part of viruses also contributed to the crossing of interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of coronaviruses can be considered "moderately high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year at one site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high rate of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Ramdevpir inhibits the replication of coronaviruses due to the inhibition of this attribvalue and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that should be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the mutation rate can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to the person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-humped camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals will rapidly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, a large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecific coevolution favorable for the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3'end of the genome.
Third, due to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch matrices during RNA replication.
During transcription of the coronavirus DNA in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, there is often a switching of threads.
High-homologous full-size and subgenomic RNAS can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Carrier-virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecific transmission is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.
This article uses SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example that also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecific transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations on RSD of the s protein.
In General, the RSD of the coronavirus s protein interacts with the cellular receptor, and the carrier antibody response intensively selects it.
RSD in SARS-CoV is an amino acid, from 318 to 510, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2), as well as its coreceptors, to introduce the virus into the cell.
The RSD of the SARS-CoV virus is able to recognize the APF2 receptors of different animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, making interspecific transmission of the virus possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD that differ from human and civet viral strains, with 4 of them located in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have k479n and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spiked protein interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of the s protein leads to the fact that the binding affinity of the s protein to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryo-electron microscope says that the affinity of this bond is 10-20 times higher than between human APF2 and the SARS-CoV virus protein S.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but with a different segment of the s protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecific transmission from host animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecific HCoV transmission is also driven by other carrier dependency and restriction factors.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, single-humped camels, and rodents, may present a barrier to interspecific transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, HCoV viruses have to usurp dependency factors and subdue carrier restriction factors.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between virus and host still need to be defined and categorized.
Unbiased full-genome screening of carrier dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology can provide good results.
Emergence of new Hcovs: back to zero
The diversity of bat coronaviruses creates broad opportunities for the emergence of new Hcovs.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but they have been found to encode divergent orf8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localities have also been identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to undergo recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-humped camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other Hcovs in which Hcovs recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in the viral genomes, which most likely occurs as a result of getting rid of the virus from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E strain due to a double-nucleotide deletion.
While an intact open reading frame of ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, Alpaca alphacoronavirus shows a single-nucleotide insertion that results in a frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of new Hcovs is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir carriers.
When infecting bats with coronaviruses, weak symptoms or their absence were registered, which indicates mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the Pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed due to apregulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and a low level of expression of the main histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while simultaneously affecting the reading by exoribonuclease, thus creating selection pressure to generate virus strains that are highly pathogenic when entering a new host.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve due to recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no accident that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the past twenty years.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats or camels.
They replicate confidently without causing a strong immune response in the host.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with an overactive immune response and a cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung damage.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of non-binding immune response may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
In bats, the interferon response is particularly strong.
Thus, taking type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a favorable effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma is impaired in bats.
Based on this, inhibiting NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the General pattern of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While a bat betacoronavirus has been found with a 95% nucleotide homology that matches SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus with a 96 % nucleotide homology that matches SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin betacoronaviruses were found to be strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may have served as one of the intermediate carriers, or that fragments of the betacoronaviruses of pangolins may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by a human.
Coronaviruses have attracted global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV reservoir animals in human transmission.
Strong evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection occurs from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing game markets and destroying civets in them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of various lines of betacoronaviruses of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2, to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection, pangolins should be removed from food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how this may occur, remains a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, THE mers-CoV virus has long existed in single-humped camels.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels for the sake of controlling MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets of China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent mers outbreaks, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop an effective mers-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause disease outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the world.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and (or) more deadly to humans.
To reduce the amount of unnecessary contact between people and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.
After the ordeal of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until it is possible to take over new territories.
Although many properties of bats are favorable for the spread of viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals is necessary, which will be useful for preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
The puzzle of zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First, if bats transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, then it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the role of the true intermediate host is played by a third mammal, then it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin, or other mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural hosts.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
