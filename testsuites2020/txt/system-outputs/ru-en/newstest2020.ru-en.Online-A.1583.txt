how long do these symptoms last?
and all chest pains should be treated this way, especially given your age
and with the high temperature
and you also need to check your cholesterol and blood pressure
and do you have a high temperature now?
and are you experiencing this pain in your chest now?
and besides, is it hard for you to breathe
and can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides these?
and how high was your temperature
And I also have a cough.
and I have a small cold with a cough
and I have a really bad chest pain today.
and whether this corresponds to the manifestation of hay fever, which you are exposed to
and there's chest pain
and I think I've got a little fever.
and I want you to describe where in your chest you're in pain
and they also have a slightly elevated temperature
and with your history of diabetes
and you know, it feels like my breasts are going to be crushed
and you know, people are coughing at me all the time.
and you're having chest pains
and you said it was pressure in the chest
anyone in the family has heart problems, heart defect, myocardial infarction, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
any other symptoms or problems you have noticed and associated with muscle pain?
Do you have other patients at home with the same symptoms?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you short of breath now?
Do you still experience chest pain
because it's flu season
but we also shouldn't go unheeded because of the pain in the pectoral cell.
but now the more important problem is this chest pain
But I'm having trouble breathing.
but I know that a lot of people coughing up at me
but we need to treat any chest pain with the utmost seriousness
But you're breathing well now, aren't you?
because I don't remember that chest pain anymore.
Does it look like someone's squeezing your rib cage?
you still feel short of breath
do they complain of symptoms of ill-health?
Do you have any other chronic diseases such as high blood pressure or something like that?

Is it shortness of breath?
Do you know what her symptoms were?
Do you see this image?
drink a lot of fluids today
however, I pass the tests for diabetes
however she had symptoms exactly like me
How high is your temperature?
What's your blood pressure?
if you still have a high temperature
if you have a temperature of thirty-eight and nine or higher
If you think your symptoms or problems guarantee an improved appearance
I had a fever yesterday.
I also had a bit of a fever yesterday.
I had a fever yesterday.
I'm in a sharp pain here in my chest.
I also have a little difficulty breathing
I'll send you an image
I'm having some chest pain today.
I have a little headache today and my temperature has risen
I think it's the flu.
I think it's the flu in a mild way.
does it remind you that it's like a very, very heavy man sitting on your neck?
it all started almost simultaneously with headaches and rising temperatures
I'm in pain in the middle of my chest.
it crushes like chest pain
It's in my chest
it's in the middle of my chest
it's in the center of the chest
I had chest pain
I'm very concerned about this chest pain
I want you to describe this chest pain to me.
like high blood pressure or diabetes
like exactly in the center of the chest
from the high temperature you can now take tahipirin in the form of lollipops
and now, Mary, tell me how many days you've been showing these symptoms
now you said you're feeling pain in your chest
I feel a little pain in my chest from time to time
well, do you have any other symptoms besides pain
or is someone sitting on your chest?
exactly the same high fever and cough, headache and muscle pain
pain directly in the center of my chest
Show me in this image where you feel pain
because you have a high fever
So do you think that some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So your children have some of these symptoms?
tell me about your chest pain
temperature rises at night
the temperature I've had in the last two days
temperatures started to rise last night
this is Dr. Porter in the waiting room of the care point
well, can you tell us a little more about the pain in your chest?
well, I feel pain in the front of my body, here in my chest
Well, I feel a lot of chest pain.
so when I feel chest pain
What type of pain do you feel in your chest?
When did you start feeling this pain in your chest?
where exactly do you feel chest pain?
where exactly do you feel this pain in your chest
you experience something similar to feeling cramped in your chest
you know I have diabetes and all that
you said you were experiencing this chest pain
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. in identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or offered, officially supported by the authorities.
Several options for contact tracking apps have been developed.
This has sparked a debate about privacy issues, especially for systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate the bluetooth-based support functionality into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has teamed up with Alipay to open an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has open source and will be brought under government control. Northern Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based "StopKorona!" app that helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides prompt communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government announced that the contact tracking application was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New ealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore-based TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with geozoning function, the purpose of which is to make sure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiency if only a small part of the population uses the app.
In view of concerns about the proliferation of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" applications, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, including only "official" or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance of the public through coronavirus applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for a restriction of this type of surveillance.
The organizations have announced eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance must be "legitimate, necessary and proportionate";
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by term-limiting clauses;
Data use should be limited to coVID-19 distribution purposes;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and evidence of such security should be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties must be determined at the legal level;
protection from abuse must be guaranteed, as should the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
"Meaningful participation" should be ensured by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and representatives of marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also published their list of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to address the problem of constant surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as the need for this disappears.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download an app and avoids tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to original location data also have big potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that did not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile tracking data and card transactions, and then combined them to create text message notifications that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contact with infected persons, but also made the location information public, which was made possible by significant changes in the data protection legislation that were made in the wake of the MERS outbreak in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized and privacy-sensitive systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been made public.
Contact tracing, in which confidentiality is maintained, is a well-established concept, a significant amount of research literature on which dates back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert teams were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures privacy when collecting and using location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform's work is based on research in Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technology that allows users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without putting the privacy of that data at risk.
On 5 April 2020, groups that share the same approach and use similar protocols were founded by a global TCN coalition aimed at reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of tracking and alert applications, a key factor in their widespread distribution.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the blueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that oversee Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact-tracking initiative, which they claimed would provide privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve privacy.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deployment of tools to enable governments to create official apps to track the movements of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with data privacy
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve the problems with constant surveillance, first by implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of clearing your hands to remove contaminants, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral.
A person can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a common cold, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after bowel movements, after washing the buttocks of the child or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before and after cooking, and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the care procedures of a sick person.
After changing nappies or washing up a child going to the toilet.
After a blow-up, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic activities related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who are engaged in cooking or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Hand washing is very healthy: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and reduces infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This elementary procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
A 48% reduction in the number of cases of diarrhoea may be due to washing hands with soap. Washing your hands with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (ARI) provided that habits are learned in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after a toilet, which has become a firm habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhoea deaths by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary measures carried out under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents the occurrence of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can cause skin to dry and, consequently, damage it.
A 2012 Danish study found that too often hand washing can lead to itching and skin flax - a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal oral transmission: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (changing nappies), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where you should wash your hands to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or fingd wounds, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the procedure of washing hands with soap is quite common.
A 2015 hand-washing study in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families wash their hands with soap - a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; The U.S. is closer to the middle of the list, with a rate of 77%; China recorded the lowest rate, at 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviors and developing the habit of washing your hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hand washing in schoolchildren at a set time of day is one such methodologie that helps to accustom children to such a procedure.
The "Emergency Medical Care Programme" implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education is an example of large-scale efforts to promote children's health and educate children.
This national programme is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride.
The same programme has been successfully carried out in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means of cleansing the skin, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic contaminants, are poorly dissolved in water.
Adequate water, however, contributes to the cleansing process.
Solid soap, due to reusable use, can also contain bacteria that can get on it in previous use.
A small number of studies on the skin of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap indicate a low probability of such an attack, as bacteria are washed away with foam.
The CDC still maintains that "liquid soap with a hand dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing."
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with advertised.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection products, complex compounds may contain acids (vinegar, ascorbic, dairy) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other perfumes (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that in terms of preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin of the hands, simple soaps are just as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosan.
Hot water comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold water to remove natural fats that keep contaminants and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a hand-free tool for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene products (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers or sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as carbomer (polymer acrylic acid) in the form of gel, or moisturizers such as liquid or foam glycerin, providing the convenience of using these products and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis coli, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm reduction 3.5 similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% - 99.999% bacteria (logariths reduction 4-5) on the hands 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing means to carefully process and impregnate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubd for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The fingertips on both hands should also be thoroughly rinsed. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing to wash your hands rather than using disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.
The increasing popularity of these disinfectants is due to the ease of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if it is possible to use water and soap.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if they do not contain softening agents and/or skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the compound.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening components caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants, almost do not occur.
A lower probability of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free products do not clean their hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as conventional soap and water, since pathogens still remain on hand when using such tools.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends to a large extent on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, it has been proven that drugs that use benzalconia chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity as opposed to alcohol, which has been shown to lose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive side skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when exposed to water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommends the use of hand-washing techniques, which include the following steps:
Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to flow water, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water just does not matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as the area between the toes and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Carefully rinse your hands under running water.
Rinsing hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on your own.
Wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated. Most often people leave unattended areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use moisturizing lotion to prevent the skin drying out of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottle pumpkin with holes and/or using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions exist, such as foot-pedal taps and other low-cost options.
A crane with a foot pedal is a simple design consisting of a container suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to allow water to pour on your hands; You should use a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London sponsored by the European Symposium on paper napkins and towels; The study examined the level of hygienic paper towels, warm air dryers and more modern streaming air dryers for hands.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the pads of the fingers on average increases by 194%, and on the palms - by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increases by 42%, and on the palms - by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreases on average to 76%, and on the palms - up to 77%. The scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-contamination of several visitors to the toilets and toilet environment with each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which releases air at stated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms off and off its own unit and potentially infect other users of the toilet and bathroom within a radius of up to 2 meters.
The use of dryers for hands with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
No significant spread of microorganisms was detected using paper towels. In 2005, the company T'V Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying paper towels.
Cleaning your hands with disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution when traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in inpatient conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices does indeed help to reduce infection rates.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, and uses a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to rinse them well and wipe dry with a clean towel.
After drying hands, closing the faucet, and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, should use a paper towel.
This avoids re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogens ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other elementary procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with the use of a catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard hand-washing and treatment procedure to be applied in the health sector.
WHO's draft manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public comment.
The relevant review was co-authored by Whitby.
If regulatory approval is required, commercial devices can be used to measure performance and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization refers to the "five things" when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or bodily fluids,
before using antiseptic, as well as
after patient care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap when washing hands ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment high in antibiotic-resistant organisms. To "cleanse" the hands before surgery requires a faucet, which can be turned on and off without touching it with your hands; also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse your hands, sterile hand dry towels after washing, a sterile friction brush and another sterile cleaning tool under your fingernails.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of hands and forearms to the elbow usually for 2-6 minutes.
No need to rub your hands for too long, such as 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearm should not fall back on the hands.
After the washing is complete, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after the care of a sick person.
To combat staphylococcal infections, hospitals found that the first 20% of washing was the most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing antibacterial soap, hand washing with conventional soap leads to a more than threefold increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparison of rubbing hands with alcohol-containing solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that hand treatment with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohol solutions in terms of reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 and clostridium difficile spores on their hands. Hand hygiene activities in health facilities may include training staff to wash their hands, making hand-held alcohol available, and reminding staff to wash their hands.
More research is needed on the most effective interventions in different health facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as cost-effective and an important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to inculcate the habit of regularly washing your hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are also cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Propaganda and promotion of hand-washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in public behavior.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results need to be monitored and evaluated.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community health and epidemic surveillance was effective in improving hand hygiene in lower-middle-income countries, while public marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of the advocacy for hand-washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach approach: it promotes simple cost-effective measures in schools to encourage students to wash their hands using soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By enforcing minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of hand-washing is one of the possible measures implemented through hand hygiene information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emoji symbolizing hand washing.
Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (preserved years of life without disabilities).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand-washing with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for vulnerable people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and "founder of modern nursing."
At the time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by rotten odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections associated with health care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States began to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with "correct hand-washing techniques" were hung in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing your hands" means showing your reluctance to accept responsibility for something or to be a participant in something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; the phrase has since become more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to involuntarily wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain symbolizing an impure conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed herself and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who have remembered or observed an unethical act are more likely to wash their hands than others, and hand-washing are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after they have seen them will participate in any other "cleansing" compensating activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided in many religions including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religious services also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing after a toilet visit.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) type 2 (SARS), has become a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and elsewhere in the world so far, and the number of infected people has exceeded 80,000.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity of the disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger ones, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.
We will look at the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of further course and prevention of the disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring (Chinese New Year) festival, which fell on January 25 in 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after the outbreak due to the outbreak of a new viral infection.
Given the high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 named the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the concomitant disease coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "number one enemy to society" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications about COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from a range of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of studies in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-causing disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at this time about the prevention and prediction of the course of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been a pathogen that is not deadly to humans and mainly cause approximately 15% of total respiratory diseases.
However, in this century we have twice experienced highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with a horrific rate of death and death rate.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in the pic. Fig. 1.1, the number of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first reported to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatality was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known that health workers were infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and the city's public transport stopped working.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO declared that the coronavirus outbreak was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure. (Figure 2).2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and extent of the danger of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, following the results of a multicenter clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
All age groups were affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but most of the people aged 30 to 65 were affected.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those who did not. infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed in clusters mainly in Hubei province and in nearby regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days passed between the symptoms of COVID-19 before diagnosis.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
From the time of symptoms to death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days were onset of symptoms.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected people, which coincided with large-scale transportation on the eve of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Mortality among confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a sub-number of large wrapping viruses containing one strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In the case of SARS and MERS coronaviruses, glycoprotein of the wrapping spikes (S) binds to the cell receptors of angiotensin-transforming enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptydylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm releases the genome of viral RNA; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA, together with wrapping glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% consistent with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak at the Huangan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using translucent electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin cuts of human respiratory epithelium.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted orf8-encoded protein.
The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression of IFN' however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by zhou presented reports on cryoelectron tomography of the structure of the full-size enzyme ACE2 of a person with a resolution of 2.9 degrees in a complex with the transporter amino acids B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which is evidence in the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate master
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through civet and camels respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely the bat coronaviruses SL-CoV'X45 and SL-CoV'X21.
However, it remains unknown what species became the intermediate host, thanks to which the virus was able to overcome the species barrier and infect the human; the path of transmission also remains to be seen.
Mr. Ji and his colleagues suggested that the vectors of the virus from bats to humans were snakes, in which the homological recombination occurred in S-protein.
According to their research, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou have suggested that pangolins - long-haired mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1% distributed between both genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure. (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are for the most part still unknown.
In the laboratory, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius and 40 to 50 percent humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
IT is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heating up to 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes; effective blocking the activity of the virus can ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, perexusic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There is currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure. (Figure 4).4).
Typically, the virus that enters the host first recognizes the congenital immune system through image-recognition receptors (PPRs), including C-type lectin receptors, toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophages phagocytosis against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is activated to fight the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4 and CD8 cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4's T-cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B-cells, and CD8's T-cells directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protective cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, hyperreaction of the immune system leads to the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
People who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or have immune system disorders are more likely to be infected.
According to a study of data on the first 425 infections in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted an average of 3 days, with a spread of 0 to 24 days.
A later study, based on demographic data from 8,866 cases, found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of the quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with asymptomatic disease.
A 14-day quarantine for those who have been in contact with the virus or infected with the virus has become a common practice.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often high fever, which may be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had shortness of breath and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in the chest pictures.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 found the following indicators of the prevalence of symptoms: 98% - high fever, 76% - dry cough, 55% - shortness of breath and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of family infections and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected people.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dry cough (47%). shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required artificial ventilation, a much higher rate than those with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than coVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhoea (26%) and diarrhoea (26%). and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%), and artificial ventilation is required for 14-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this indicator, the mortality rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed mortality at 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Based on an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality rate and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher sars-CoV-2 ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new virus infection is lower than the last two.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestation often occurs when infected within the same family or group of people who have gathered together for some reason or are caught together on any transport, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often travelled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or came into contact with infected or infected people in the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people can carry the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, having been discharged from the hospital, may again become carriers of the virus, and this is a wake-up call to the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced amounts of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed with lymphoping with white blood cell counts&lt; 4×109/L, в том числе с уровнем лейкоцитов &lt; 1×109/L, а также повышенный уровень аспарагин-аминотрансферазы и вирусемия.
In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell subsidence.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, the product of fibrin decay present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed with chest X-rays characterized by uneven blackouts on both sides or blackouts of the type of "matte glass" in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
In the development of ARD, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.
Type I and II pneumocytes dysfunction lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung decay.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray examination often coincide with the most severe cases.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detachment of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes and intertkin lymphocytic infiltration, and multi-nuclear syncitial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ARD and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection method was used as the main criterion for DIAJ-19 detection by means of polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false negative results, which can accelerate the rate of the epidemic, from February 13, 2020, China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on PCR with reverse transcriptase).
The situation with THE SARS diagnosis was similar.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data on medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and results of X-ray examination.
On 14 February 2020, a team led by Mr. Feng zhang described the protocol for applying the CRISPR repeat SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a density of 20 to 10 to 18 moles/L to 200 to 10-18 moths/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of the original sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly improve the sensitivity of tests and the convenience of their conduct.
Due to lack of experience in countering previously unknown coronavirus, doctors are generally able to provide COVID-19 patients with only supportive therapy while trying to use any therapeutic methods that have been used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).2).
These therapeutic methods include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressors, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and may be less affected by other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, disruption and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, to relieve symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapulmonal circulation used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organs are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokin storm is a consequence of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
A cytokin storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process developing in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFN, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release a huge number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ARD and multiorgan deficiency.
In the treatment of a cytokine storm, especially in patients in a serious condition, the suppression of immunity is crucial.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that serve as interleukin-6 inhibitors, were used to treat the cytokin storm.
Other treatments for a cytokine storm based on immune suppression include modulating the immune response to control T cells; blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of Janus-kinase; use of pancakes, cytokine signals supressors 4 and histordeacetalase inhibitors.
To reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses are widely used steroids as suppressors of immunity.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in the treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly impair the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small to medium dosages are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesyvir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment of an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by The Ebola virus and the Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single-stranded RNA, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Relying on this data, Gilead has provided this drug composition to China for paired studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
Baricitinib, z-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ritovirin were also offered as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of recovered patients and the production of antibodies
Blood collection in patients cured of the contagious disease has been used for treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population for a very long time.
Indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are in immunoglobulin, produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
On the basis of this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples of a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and oxygenated blood saturation.
However, in order to propose to use this method en masse before conducting specific therapy, no checks or explanations are required.
In addition, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma use should be carefully considered, taking into account the therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokines emission syndrome, which, given the toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma for the treatment of patients in critical condition requires a lot.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to single out B-cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can immediately go to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to identify and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific COVID-19 therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Tian Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The largest proportion of recovering patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces in China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Ningxia (50%). and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, the lowest proportion of recoverers (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison, as the assessment should take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively using Western medicine and combination treatments for Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the timing of normalization of body temperature, elimination of symptoms and medical care in the hospital were significantly less in patients for treatment of which used a combination of methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine, than in patients who were treated only by Western methods.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to develop symptoms (from mild to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods, than in the group that was treated only by Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of some interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques or their combination.
Patients who suspect or confirm coVID-19 are mostly afraid of acute and even fatal disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment such as cortisone insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, may increase people's anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, those under suspicion and contact with them, as well as all other people who need it.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary mental health teams should be formed, informed with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the chain of transmission from animal carriers of infection and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been carried out on S-protein-based vaccines aimed at producing long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live weakened vaccines for SARS viruses.
However, prior to clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural settings when they are used in age-related patients, the model of infection by lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonous viruses.
Perhaps the reason is the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS virus disease continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions through the preservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant proteins have been developed to combat MERS, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for those without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (average 18 months) required for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to take a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients manage to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to create a predictive model of the disease to prioritize their response, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on clinical trial data presented to date, the following factors may influence or associated disease prediction in COVID-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of SARS virus disease, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have initial illnesses and complications, and were significantly older than those patients who did not require such therapy (average 66 years versus 51 years), which indicates that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmia damage.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death for patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be associated with ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor of the course of the disease, reaction to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, severity of the disease and PROVID-19 prognosis was taken into account.
In addition, elevated levels of lactatdehydrogenase, aspartin-aminetransferase, alanine-aminetransferase and creatin kinase can also be predicted.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
The main clinical symptoms: to predict the results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, the data of the chest X-ray study and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunity suppressors commonly used in infectious diseases as complementary therapies to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if steroid is needed to treat coVID-19 patients, these drugs should be prescribed in small dosages and short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress against the backdrop of the COVID-19 epidemic, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with high levels of uncertainty, and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve stress in such patients and help them to return to normal life, they must be consulted psychologically and long-term support.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or do not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet run out of incubation can spread the virus on a significant scale, making epidemiological control significantly difficult.
However, it was believed that SARS-CoV virus transmission occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic and is more difficult to control.
A great deal of work is under way in China, which has declared a general quarantine in Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as extended the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, introduced in order to interrupt the chain of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures are causing great harm to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients being identified is decreasing, suggesting a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic calculations, the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of fading will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from the team, led by Ira Longini, have modeled for the end of the epidemic and have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in nasal and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and had been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategies may have had an effect.
Initial projections suggest that Ebola was expected to affect up to a million people and kill half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to take control.
There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infecting capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken and, over time, it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure. (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been detected in feces, which means that an oral-fecal mode of transmission is also possible.
According to a recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders who are in contact with or infected.
The first line of defence in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; surgical masks and N95 respirators (series 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent microcapl fluid from potentially infected to fly in the air and settle on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (series 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions of 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virions; SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, medical professionals who are in direct contact with patients must wear N95-class masks (series 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical professionals should wear a tailored protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-end goggles.
It is strongly recommended that the entire population in affected or potentially threatened regions wash their hands more frequently with disinfectant, try not to leave the house with self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
An acceptable distance to the patient is a distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, its high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, was intended to be a wake-up call for China, taking into account the experience it gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured citizens by stating that the new virus had low contaminants and limited fertility in human-to-human transmission and that preventing the spread and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Chinese New Year celebrations, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can learn this stark lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) more closely monitor and respond to unusual information coming from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain a potential epidemic in the early stages of its development, rather than reassure the public; and (4) more often to conduct targeted and effective exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly check and improve the response of society.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by a previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease spread throughout China and at the time of writing had spread to 50 countries.
Because the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 outbreak experienced a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older persons are also higher than among young people.
THE death toll from SARS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in the asymptomatic course of the disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why the SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more scalable than the SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive samples for the virus.
All this greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
Against the backdrop of such rapid progress, COVID-19 research has not yet resolved some of the most important issues, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homologator between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that the SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.
Which animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, for example from bats to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical samples have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into the airway cells and provokes subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear as well as SARS, or will it recur periodically like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent Stage I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investment in vaccine development and research in its communications.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI Vaccine Initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under study and development to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine in early 2020.
Some of the platform's main objectives included in phase I security research:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, and RNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, a further 37 candidates were reported, but little publicly available information (presumably in the planning or development phase).
In the I-II phases, preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing is carried out, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and at several sites, with the simultaneous identification of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically cover more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for efficacy in terms of disease prevention and at the same time the side effects are tracked at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still under preclinical studies).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Australia, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced that work would begin on its own vaccine to begin testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Shoemaker, announced that they were starting work on their vaccine.
Janssen is working with his biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to the one used to vaccinate against neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the start of trials.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop the Peptide Vaccine Ii-Key against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a candidate drug for the vaccine that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materials Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, in western Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
to develop and produce a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that even in an expedited mode it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop the vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in quebec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research, they had created a particle similar to coronavirus.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested against.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on IRNA.
BNT162 is a candidate for an IRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it will receive the results of preclinical trials, and their final drug-candidate for the vaccine may begin to be tested in humans as early as autumn.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced a $4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine consortium with the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI's total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.
CePI's other investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and the university.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine-candidate drug was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced 275 million Canadian dollars to fund 96 medical countermeasure research projects against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian Government announced a allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans for a national "vaccine bank" that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA administered subunicical SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, prompting strong responses of antigen-specific antibodies in mice that were manifested 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be produced in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will multiply within human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities combined IBM supercomputer resources in conjunction with hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits besides the ability to prevent diseases.
Another randomized study in Australia involved 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines being developed may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines using animal COVID-19 models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain biosecurity 3 infection in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccine to treat SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study, which was conducted at the time, could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral-based vaccines and were in the process of development, two were adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-MERS-S.
Conspiracy theories circulated on social media, claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that the vaccine was already in place.
Social media posts quoted some patients who claimed to have patented genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-transforming enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal instrument located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains N-end peptidase domain M2 and C-end transport domain renal amino acid collectrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, its enzymatically active domain gets to the surface of cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular DOMAIN domain ACE2 is snuck away from the transmembred domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar cells of the lungs of type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and cells of the smooth muscles of the arteries of most organs.
Biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNAs is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
Ace2's main function is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vasocenen ii.
ACE2, in turn, chippes away the carboxylic end amino acid phenylalanin from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Arg-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-PRO-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including "des-Arg9" -bradiquinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrant protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS virus); SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, the binding of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the primement of the protein S serinova protease of the carrier TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic remedy. This has led some to believe that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help in the fight against infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend that standard therapy be continued with ACE and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure patients.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients with a common risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is supposed to be a novelty in therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolisacharid.
The period of half-life rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the beginning of the action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure in 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Pandemic coronavirus 2019-2020 is the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020, a public health emergency was declared and subsequently declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New York.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering your mouth while coughing, keeping a distance between people, identifying and self-isolating people who suspect their infection.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls and the closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's students.
Misinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese nationals, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who resemble them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where there have been significant cases of the virus spreading.
As a result of the reduction in travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan City, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Infections have mainly been linked to the Yuanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have zoonous origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that bears a great resemblance to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease had arisen on December 1, 2019, and the infected had not visited the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the South China branch of the Morning Post, whose information was not verified, suggested that the very first case of infection occurred in a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased, but had started to rise unexpectedly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China had exceeded the number of new infections in China for the first time.
The number of cases can be significantly underestimated, in particular because of the many cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and under making up less than 2.4 per cent worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would be infected before effective group immunity was formed in the country's population.
The statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted a formal policy requiring that only minor symptoms should not be tested.
The study, published on 16 March, found that in China, 86% of COVID-19 infections were detected before 23 January, and that such undocumented patients were the source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number of infection (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
The study, published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimated that the figure could be 5.7.
Most coVID-19 patients recover well.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death was from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period - 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were in the over-60s, and 75 per cent of the deaths were comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official death data from the COVID-19 pandemic typically include deaths of patients with positive COVID test results consistent with official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account the deaths of people who have not been tested , for example, in the case of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures by four to five times.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges, "We know that the reported death toll is lower than the actual one." His words are supported by reports of some isolated cases in the United States. Such incomplete records are often found in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was reported in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was reported on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary by region and time of spread of the disease; they are also affected by the amount of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health. The "mortality/morbidity" factor represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
Data for different regions vary.
In China, the mortality-to-morbidity ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who developed symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the percentage of deaths due to the disease (CFR), the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the percentage of deaths from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the rates of certain populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the mortality rate from the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The top digit of this range is consistent with the results of the first random testing on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Bony, of Pennsylvania State University, argues that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to go to the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers ends, they begin to go out.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen."
Senior Medical Adviser to the Chinese government, Chung Nanshan, says "everything could end by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating for perhaps a year or two."
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the direction of Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine is created (perhaps 18 months or more) " physical distance measures and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University, said, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever ever go away because it's so easily transmitted," and that it "can turn into a seasonal disease that flares up every year."
The virulence of the new outbreaks will depend on the collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum in the airways (mucus), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, sore muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims to be seriously ill with respiratory problems in about one in six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immediate symptoms such as breathing difficulties, persistent pain or compression in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and facial or lip blueness. If these symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
In some infected people, the disease may be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend to place those in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed, under strict control and examined for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of cases of asymptomatic disease ranges from a few units to 44% of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it usually is five days. It is not yet clear what the symptom of smell loss is: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom initially was 30%, and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air along with coughing, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, open cough drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets ejected into the air during conversation, which are able to stay in the air for a longer time. Respiratory drops can also form when exhaling, including during conversation, although the virus is usually not carried through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (SLR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests have been tested positive three days before the onset of symptoms, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus prior to the symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects two to three other people. The virus can survive on surfaces from a few hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on a cardboard surface - for one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just as after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia in a group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 bears a great resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is assumed to have a zoonous origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgen to Sarbecovirus (cell line B) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the holistic-genomic level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolins and humans.
A holistically-genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92%) of the total number of people in the world (92%). there is between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but it is not enough to prove that pangolins are the intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of an infected secret or CT scan.
The results of the study comparing PCR and CT scans used in Wuhan showed that CT scans are much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease flowing processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in COVID-19 diagnostics."
WHO has published several protocols for SARS-CoV-2 testing, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is being tested.
It can be carried out on respiratory tests and on blood samples.
Results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to several days.
Usually a nasopharyngeal smear is used for the test, although a smear of yawn can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them had been accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of symptom imaging on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral clouding in the type of matte glass and the absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for compiling an international database of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to the similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, when coVID-19 is identified, the images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
A large study was conducted in China comparing chest CT scans and PCR testing, and found that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered more quickly; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be seen as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
To diagnose the virus with X-rays and computed tomography, sparkling neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, use of wipes when coughing or sneezing, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may have become infected should wear a medical mask in crowded places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance yourself from people. Many Governments recommend that any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak be refrained from and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has been able to spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading to a population where some members do not know where or how they were infected. Health care providers who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions as well as precautions when in contact with others and eye protection. Contact tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
Governments' use of data on the whereabouts of citizens using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have issued statements demanding that this type of surveillance be limited.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and offered; As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert teams were working to develop solutions that protect the privacy of personal data, such as recording a user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, they will be notified. There are also unsubstantiated versions of how to prevent infection, such as rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC also recommends washing your hands with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or having severe hand pollution, as well as before eating, after a sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with alcohol content of at least 60%.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the stainless steel surface the disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 -7.5% pervidone iodine.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if suspected of COVID or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day care facility, all spaces such as classrooms, restrooms, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or a napkin when coughing or sneezing and immediately throwing away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of the mask can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that dissipate in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "using a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main way of infection." Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask does indeed reduce the number of touches to the face.
Several countries have begun calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC, USA, recommends wearing non-medical tissue masks. China has separately stressed the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask on public transport or crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand are urging people to make facial masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are not allowed to go out without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Vietnam asked all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered all grocery shoppers to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where ten million medical masks a day have been produced since mid-March, all passengers on trains and long-distance buses were ordered to use medical masks.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when they go outside; residents who cannot purchase masks were advised to sew them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is a measure to combat infection, aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protections include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many regional governments, particularly affected by the outbreak, are now prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people who could gather in one place, as recommended by U.S. government and health organizations, was promptly reduced from 250 (in regions where there was no COVID-19 distribution data) to 50, and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gatherings in groups of more than two people. Older people and those suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of serious disease. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", thus clarifying the purpose of the measure is to reduce physical contact within social connections, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has been understood in such a way that people should expose themselves to complete social exclusion, rather than staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have issued guidelines on sexual health that should be used during a pandemic.
Among others, it has been recommended that you have sex only with your regular partners with whom you live and who you are sure that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect that they are infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many Governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that all populations in the affected areas be quarantined themselves.
High-risk individuals were given strict quarantine.
Individuals who may have been in contact with infected COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region largely affected by the epidemic have been advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to control the outbreak include containing the spread of the disease, suppressing or mitigating it.
The spread of the disease is contained at an early stage and is intended to track and isolate those infected, as well as other infection control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are directed towards mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the alignment of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and provide more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmacetic interventions that can help deal with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as school closures and the cancellation of mass events; Engaging the community in facilitating and participating in such measures; and environmental protection measures, such as cleaning surfaces. After the seriousness of the outbreak became apparent in China, more decisive action was taken to contain the outbreak, such as isolating entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as a system of alerts for the movements of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to self-in-bed individuals and heavy fines were imposed on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of medical masks and fined for stockpiling excess medicines. Modelling across the UK and the US has shown that there are serious challenges to mitigation (slowing but not halting the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the epidemic growth).
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the peak burden on the health system by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating in the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if it happens earlier), because otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has social and economic costs.
There are currently no antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter medications for colds, drinking enough fluids and resting can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory support.
The use of steroid drugs can only hurt.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for use for COVID-19 treatment.
WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO sees improving the capacity and adaptation of health to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to help redistribute resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent procedures where possible, detecting the virus and isolating patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and enhancing intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection may have occurred - the so-called "zero patient".
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection was likely to have occurred on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the Wholesale Huangan Seafood Market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonous origin. On 26 December, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was reported at a clinic in Hubei Province, with which a doctor, Chang Tianjin, worked with, reported the case to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan City on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were alerted by police to responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for causing panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice informing WHO of the situation.
Wuhan Health Authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in the largest number of confirmed infections in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million infections have been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory home stay, mandatory home shelter or isolation), and curfews. As of 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, had been quarantined, more than 50 million were isolated in the Philippines, some 59 million were isolated in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure rose to 2.6 billion, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the veracity of which has not been verified, the date is November 17.
On December 26, dr. Chang Jixian was working on a case of a mass case of pneumonia of an unknown type, which was notified by her clinic on December 27 by the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In response to such notices, police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
Initially, the China National Health Commission said there was "clear evidence" of the newly discovered virus being transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later called "people's war" by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping.
The events of the "largest quarantine in the history of mankind" began to unfold, on January 23, a sanitary cordon was announced and a ban on entry to Wuhan and back, later the measure spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei Province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The city banned the use of personal transport.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of the Huaoshenshan Temporary Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital was built, Leishenshan, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also repurposed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travellers and extending the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Universities and schools across the country have been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly for schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote mode of operation.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei province and beyond.
Public transport schedules have been changed and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a regime of control over the movement of citizens has been introduced and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) have experienced some form of restriction on outdoor movement. After the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of 23 March, only one case of domestic transmission had been reported in mainland China, five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, except Wuhan, were lifted, two months after the closure of the province was quarantined. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that from March 28, entry for visa or residence permit applicants will be suspended. The exact date for the cancellation of the order was not given.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on businesses and factories to resume operations and provided companies with packages of monetary stimulus measures. On 4 April, at 10:00 a.m., a national three-minute "minute of silence" was held, marking a day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the holiday of kinmin, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, observing the physical distance to avoid a second outbreak of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shincheongji, in Daegu.
Shincheongji's followers came to Daegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the church's 9,336 followers, 1,261 (approximately 13%) were in the church. reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the highest level of alarm.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on 28 February, and this figure rose to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed the presence of the virus in three soldiers.
The outbreak affected the number of journeys, hence the airline flight schedule was changed. South Korea has launched a screening programme for the virus, contact tracking and quarantine measures for contact individuals. This program is considered to be the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile app by all visitors from abroad, total testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, and enhanced testing capabilities, allowing to test up to 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in the fight against the outbreak, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated there. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they considered to be the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections in a single day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad would be placed under a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on April 1, 121 countries sought help in testing for the virus in South Korea.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where two people died later in the day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, universities and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020, that the government had no plans to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict long-distance travel were announced in March, but heavy movement between the cities continued ahead of the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran has been the center of the virus since China in February.
Amid claims of a cover-up in Iran, by 28 February more than a dozen countries had linked the case to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
Iran's parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronavirus had been reported in Iran every hour and one new coronavirus death every ten minutes.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the official data reported.
U.S. sanctions on Iran are also expected to affect the country's financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italy when two Chinese tourists tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome and tested positive.
The number of infections began to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 infections was later detected. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree to contain the outbreak, under which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "The entrance to and exit zone will be blocked.
In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend the work of enterprises and cancel sporting events." On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 people had already died in Italy at the time.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for setting a waiting priority for patients to receive medical care that may have to be used.
On March 19, Italy overtook China in coronavirus mortality, ranking first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there had been 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in Italy, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that a combination of two factors can contribute to such a high mortality rate in Italy: the large number of elderly citizens of that country and the inability to examine anyone who currently has coronavirus.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus most calmly of all the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not responding quickly enough and in a serious way to the dangers faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all travel and social contacts not of paramount importance be abstained, suggesting that people should work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres if possible.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment venues, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but no more than 2,500 pounds a month as a measure to support the public during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced tougher measures on social distance, banning more than two people from gathering and restricting travel and outdoor activities only to occasions of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with the exception of businesses that provide "vital activities," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.
On 20 January, a man who returned from Wuhan on 15 January was confirmed to have the first case of COVID-19 in the country.
On January 29, the White House established a Task Force on Coronavirus Control.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed travel restrictions on visitors from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government's leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, population testing in the United States was not immediately initiated, and as a result, the true extent of the outbreak was hidden during this period.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the federal government in February, the federal government's lack of permission to use non-state test kits, which were developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done on the appointment of a doctor).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by February 27.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by March 13.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported, "Many patients, even if symptoms are present and a doctor's appointment, waited their turn for tests for hours or days." Following the first coronavirus death in the United States on 29 February from Washington State, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which other states soon declared.
On March 3, schools in Seattle were canceled, and by mid-March, schools had closed nationwide. On 6 March 2020, a team of epidemiologists at Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the projections of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Additional Appropriations Act to respond to the coronavirus, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to federal authorities to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences and encouraged employees to work from home.
Sporting events and seasons have been cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions on much of Europe, excluding the UK, for 30 days starting March 13.
The following day, he expanded the restrictions to include the UK and Ireland.
On March 13, the President declared a state of emergency in the country, which made it possible to use federal funds to deal with the crisis.
Beginning March 15, many companies began closing or reducing opening hours across the U.S., helping to combat the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On 23 March, it was reported that 10,700 cases had been reported per day in New York, more than the total number in South Korea.

WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted clear differences between the situation with the outbreak of SARS, which occurred in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of classified information, allegedly hindering the prevention and containment of its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government "regularly provided updates on the situation to panic avoid the eve of the Chinese New Year."
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Goden Galea noted that while "this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO", it was also "a very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the site of greatest spread" and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after the ability of human-to-human transmission outside China to be confirmed and the number of people infected in other countries increased, WHO declared an international public health emergency (PHEIC); this was the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first introduced during the swine flu pandemic.
Who Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adan, stated that the PHEIC announcement was driven by "the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily impede international movement and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO asked the world community for $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need for urgent assistance to countries that "do not have systems in place to identify people who have contracted the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached those countries".
Mr. Tedros also stated that "the indicator of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest link" and called on the international community to "make a choice: invest today or pay the price in the future". At a press conference on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the capacity of the entire UN system in response to the problem."
As a result, a UN Crisis Management Unit has been established to coordinate all United Nations response; these steps, who who say, will "focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to combat the outbreak more socially and economically."
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the creation of a joint task force that provided work by international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in the resolution of the situation at home and assess the "seriousness of the disease and its contagion", organized seminars and meetings with leading national agencies, as well as field visits to assess the "effectiveness of provincial and district response measures". including urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that "it is too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must be prepared for it."
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. ON 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global coronavirus spread would be elevated from "high" to "very high" - the highest degree of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, executive director of who's health emergencies programme, warned in a statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet on the reality of the situation: it's time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared, and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid the "worst scenario."
Ryan also said that current data does not warrant a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that declaring a pandemic would mean that "we essentially recognize that everyone on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said who was "deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the issue."

In response to the situation, a petition was filed against the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, with a request to resign, which had been signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting everyone's rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to take life-saving measures against them, and the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The panel stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not in any way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including people with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has created a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaru, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaru, for their efforts to combat the pandemic that began in China's Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level Communist Party (CPC) leaders were dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and the dismissals showed dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Xiao Lijian, disagreed with an earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak had started in Wuhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that "censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with a virus that has now turned into a global pandemic," a statement that was criticized by some commentators who argue that this approach is racist and "distracts from the inability of the U.S. President's administration to contain the spread of the disease."
The Daily Beast gained access to a U.S. government telegram containing a communications strategic trick apparently invented by the National Security Council; there are such references to the strategy: "It's all about China.
We are being asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances."
The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned of the presence of a "geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through PR and the so-called policy of generosity."
Borrell also stated that "China strongly promotes the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States."
China has also called on the U.S. to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in the wake of U.S. sanctions imposed on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting aid intended for other countries to their own country.
Medical masks have also been subject to disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of European Union support for coronavirus-ridden Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China has reacted bilaterally.
This is definitely not a sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment to be sent to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or little useful for Italy."
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on world public opinion at the "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering assistance to American counterparts, Putin assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to retalia little if necessary."
NATO's Defender 2020 military exercises, scheduled in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted in a reduced format.
Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the public health crisis that is today, these exercises endanger not only the U.S. military and many European participating countries, but also those in the countries where such events should be held." The Iranian government has been hit hard by the virus. About two dozen members of Parliament, as well as fifteen other current or former political figures, were infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an open letter appealed to world leaders for help, informing that his country is experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic has led to calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health and childcare system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political analysts expected it could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of running for re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated as a because of the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in designated areas designated by the Government.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they considered to be the government's inadequate response to the outbreak. The pandemic has forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that the move will allow Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, parliament voted to give Prime Minister Viktor Orban the indefinite right to govern by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been cited as responsible for several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in the face of panic and disruptions in production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment, which was caused by increased consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
There have also been panic purchases in several localities; this led to the theft of essential goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water from the shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This jump led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the supply of medical products for four to six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protection around the world, and WHO has warned that health workers will therefore be at risk.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, daigou buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and were subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, severe food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and the illicit trade in critical products that have proved successful have prevented the acute food shortages that were expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but industry officials believe that agricultural prices may rise.
Food store shelves remained empty only temporarily, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork supplies to ensure adequate food for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to conserve food stocks in case of emergencies exist in Italy.
The damage to the global economy has affected China: according to media reports dated March 16, China's economy suffered greatly in the first two months of 2020 due to measures to combat the spread of the virus, which resulted in a 20.5% decrease in retail sales.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center; therefore, a viral outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agate Demarai, an employee of the Economist Intelligence Unit, market volatility will continue until a clearer picture of potential results is available.
In January 2020, some analysts calculated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could surpass the effects of the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004.
According to one estimate made by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis, damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly taken "urgent action" following a sharp fall in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indexes, including the NASDA's 100, the S'P 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial equity index, showed the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government advice not to undertake any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for flights, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and zantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.
Several train stations and ferry crossings were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
A number of events involving a large number of people, including the annual New Year's Eve festivals, have been cancelled by national and regional governments; private companies also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many New Year's events were cancelled and tourist attractions closed to prevent mass gatherings; for example, Beijing closed the Forbidden City and abolished traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, the authorities extended the New Year holidays until 10 February, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of infectious disease response to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling New Year's Eve celebrations. The retail sector has suffered globally, with store opening hours reduced and some stores temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60%.
As a result, in March, the attendance of shopping centers fell by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving sanitary conditions, installing equipment to check visitors' temperature and cancelling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission on Latin America, the pandemic recession in Latin America could leave 14 to 22 million more people out of poverty than would have been the case in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China's 300 million rural migrant workers have been found at home in their country's provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government help.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that a coronavirus outbreak in the United States could take 47 million jobs and could reach 32 percent. The self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers on a daily basis out of work. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44 per cent of Canadian households experienced unemployment in one way or another. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs since the introduction of severe isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have transferred their employees to government-subsidized reduced part-time work.
A German part-time pay scheme has also been introduced in France and the UK.
The arts and cultural heritage have also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have tried to support their (often publicly funded) mission of ensuring access to cultural heritage for the community, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, if possible, supporting the people of the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely around the world, or access to them had been restricted to varying costs, and exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or moved to other dates.
In return, active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
There have also been setbacks in the film industry. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week in Rome, which is held in the last week of the Christian penetus period, Lent.
Many dioceses recommend older Christians to stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or televised, while leaders of some churches have offered to hold outdoor services.

Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also shattered plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; On March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "rescheduled for the period beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling venues around the world have been closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, have also been either rescheduled or cancelled.
This has led to many players switching online, and many gambling sites are reporting a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing its results on the Internet, organizing live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; it helps people in creative professions to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
A number of Internet memes on the topic of coronavirus have appeared on the network, many of which are humorous and smooth out the disturbing moods characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as to people in the hotspots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In february's news reports (when most cases were still confined to China), racist sentiments were recorded in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received just retribution for something.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese sentiment is also on the rise.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Citizens of China, as well as those living in the affected areas, were supported both online and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, particularly Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the impact of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New ealand, Singapore and South Korea signed an early petition insisting that Chinese citizens should be barred from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#КитайцыНеПриезжайтеВЯпонию) was a leader on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, reported a growing level of racist sentiment and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics consider this view racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanjar.
Students coming from China's northeastern India and studying in India's major cities have reported cases of harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party' State Unit in West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God took revenge on them."
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which called them "misleading". In China, the pandemic has once again unleashed xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese citizens: foreigners have been referred to as "foreign garbage" and objects to be "disposed of".
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have published their scientific articles on the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on the publishing servers of preprints, such as bioRxiv.

Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral drugs concluded that "the effectiveness of the drugs was not found".
The drugs have been developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will bind to SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community criticizes the reprofiling of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV and AIDS.
WHO included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat The Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later found that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against a variety of filo, pneumo, paramyxo and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently under way, including two conducted by the University Of Cleveland Clinics; one is performed on patients with a moderate form of the disease, and the other - on patients with a more severe form of the disease.
Currently, three clinical trials are underway for intravenous vitamin C supplementation for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo use (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, trials of the antibiotic azithromycin began in New York State.
The Japan National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclessonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for its use in the treatment of presymptom patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II, a form of angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2, is trialed with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of the disease to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
A study called COLCORONA invited 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and non-effective contraception women are not eligible to participate in this study.
In Italy, several coagulants are on the test.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Authority to publish recommendations on the use of the drug.
On 14 April, a multicenter study involving 300 patients on the study of the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the reprofiling of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for coVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: umiphenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been deemed potentially suitable for use as a coVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tested in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the use of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and control coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk management depends on the location and work task, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic in the community, and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reported that lower-risk posts have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and such interventions require basic infection control measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home with signs of illness, following respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected coVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to become infected due to the ongoing spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This may include public-contact workers, such as schools, high-density workplaces and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include airing using high-performance air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protection in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and morgue staff who have come into contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are at high risk; at the same time, the risk is increased to a very high level in the procedures of such staff, accompanied by aerosol formation, or the collection/processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of security engineering, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task at hand.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have different kinds of effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others, or for fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns can vary both in terms of the types of goods that are in demand and the way they purchase such goods (e.g., off-peak purchases with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographic regions affected by COVID-19. The Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to organize protection.
The plans address risks associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors occurring at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic illness.
The plans also outline the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may follow national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals for responding to the epidemic include reducing the spread of the virus to staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is influenced by the severity of diseases in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health, for grouping such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective safety engineering tools are most effective, followed by administrative measures and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering and safety means isolating employees from job-related risk sites and does not rely on employee behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures requiring action from an employee or employee.
Personal Protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protection should be selected depending on the threat to the employee, fit in size (e.g. respirators), used continuously and properly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid infection.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) believes that positions at least risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including closing their mouths with a cough and sneezing, providing napkins and containers for garbage, readiness for remote or shift work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and cleaning.
Rapidly identifying and isolating individuals who are potentially infected is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until the heat stop, the absence of elevated body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretic drugs or other anti-anxiety drugs, and requires flexible hospital policies, allow staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and to ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, but are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the community in the area where the business is located, or due to the person's recent travels to the COVID-19 site.
These categories include public workers, such as schools, high-density workplaces and some large retail stores. Engineering safety features for such groups and groups at higher risk include installing high-performance air filters, increasing ventilation intensity, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective screens, and installing windows for customer service without getting out of the car. Administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups include advising sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting shift schedules, stopping non-critical travel to COVID-19 locations, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum for answering concerns, providing up-to-date training for COVID-19 risk workers and safeguarding measures training workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, the proper use of such tools, providing resources and a work environment conducive to personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, restricting access to the workplace by customers and the public, posting information signs about the need to wash hands and other protections against COVID-19. Depending on work tasks, workers at at least the average risk may be required to wear personal protective equipment, including combinations including gloves, a robe, a screen or face mask, or goggles.
In rare cases, workers at risk may be required to wear respirators.
If a person becomes ill on a plane, measures such as isolating a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a sick person to care for a sick person, providing a sick mask, or asking such person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing.
Secondary crew members must wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler, either in contact with bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces must then be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, safety measures include delaying travel in the event of illness, self-isolation and prompt informing of the medical centre on the ship in the event of heat or other symptoms in anyone on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in the isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person has been in a school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or medium level of infection in the community, social distancing strategies may be introduced, such as cancellation of visits for face-to-face meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, adjusting arrival and care times, limiting inconsequential visits, and using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for long-term non-attendance of school may be considered. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same instructions as prescribed by ambulance paramedics, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during detention, employees should clean and disinfect their uniform belts and equipment before reuse with household cleaning aerosols or by rubbing, observe standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health care and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff who are in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in aerosol-forming procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include sensing, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk mortuary workers include staff handling the bodies of people with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such officers perform an autopsy, they move into a very high-risk category. Additional safety engineering tools for such risk groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19, including aerosol-related procedures.
In some health care facilities and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated with precautionary measures for biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be assigned to demarcated waiting areas based on suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protections, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact up to 6 feet away with patients with a confirmed disease or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as those performing aerosol-forming procedures.
In the U.S., NIOSH-approved respirators for a person with a N95 or higher-end filter should be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that sets out requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of clothing because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by respiratory rather than physiological fluids.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks for screening staff at the point of admission.
Who recommends that patients with COVID-19 or vectors without aerosol-accompanied procedures wear a surgical mask, goggles or face protection screen, robe and gloves.
The N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn instead of a surgical mask during aerosol procedures.
Given the inadequacy of personal protective equipment around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protections by using the capabilities of remote medicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, ensuring access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only those personal protective equipment that are necessary for a particular task, prolonged use of the same respirator without removing, when working with several patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and recommending not to use masks for people without symptoms.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the millionth threshold of infections worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 people have died from coVID-19 coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and the first coronavirus death was recorded in the country.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries that had not reported any cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 A.M. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported, of which at least 5,900 have been fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronavirus infection were reported in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the regime of self-isolation of the city's citizens until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days; results: 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one no vote.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas previously the curfew lasted only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state's home self-isolation regime has been extended by order until May 1.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease goes viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads through close contact between humans and each other, often through microscopic droplets released into the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat when they hit the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasopharyngeal smear.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population vary: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, constant pain or compression in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, blue face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, you should seek immediate medical attention.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat, may occur less frequently.
Also, there are gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea in different percentages.
Some cases reported in China initially manifested only a feeling of compression in the chest and rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and eventually death occurs.
This is called the incubation period.
The INCUBation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to manifest within 11.5 days after infection. According to available data, not all those infected are showing symptoms.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with asymptomatic disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; at the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
China's National Health Commission has begun to include asymptomatic cases in its daily summary from 1 April; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) refused asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
With loud speech, more drops are released into the air than when the normal volume is spoken.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that when an open cough, droplets can spread at a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosal transmission of the virus is still possible, and testing of airborne air collectors located in corridors outside human rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (SLR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through faeces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus may be possible before symptoms appear, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects two to three other people. The virus can survive on the surface from a few hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a cardboard surface the virus is able to live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used properly, have a fairly beneficial effect in terms of infection control: soap destroys the virus's fat protective layer, deactivating it in this way, and is able to eliminate it from skin surfaces and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconychloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and the sixth patient had the highest blood virus content on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia in a group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which reveals its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19 because the virus penetrates host cells through angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar cells of type II lungs.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell with the help of a characteristic superficial glycoprotein - "thorn" (ashlomer).
Twelve per cent of those infected were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but acute damage to myocardial may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities because they are involved in the work of this organ.
High thrombosis rate (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in IIC with COVID-19, and may indicate adverse prognosis. An autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrations in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a pathway to ACE2-expressive epithelial airway cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyper-burning.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, secreting IL-6, and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrations were also found during the autopsy.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard testing method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a smear from the nasopharynx, but a sample of a smear from the nose or sputum can also be used.
Results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at two-week intervals, and their results are not of direct importance.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop tests using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, tests for antibodies that could detect the presence of infection at this time, as well as possible infection in the past, were under development but not yet widespread.
Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests has shown that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, giving permission for its use later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by the University of Wuhan's Chunnan Hospital indicate methods of detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multi-dose subpleural sealing focuses on the type of "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, the symptom of cobblestone pavement (the sill of the partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study performed during the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, sealing and pulmonary edema
There are four types of severity of viral pneumonia:
mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multi-core giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: the organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DVS syndrome); leukoerytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, following the rules of respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering your mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the arm.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out a high-quality hygienic procedure for the hands.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact between infected patients and large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and businesses have been closed, the movement of citizens has been restricted and major public events have been cancelled.
The distancing guidelines also mean that people must be at least 6 feet (1.8 metres) apart.
There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected to be completed until 2021, the bulk of the COVID-19 spread response is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "plateauing."
The CDC also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or having severe hand pollution, as well as before and after a sneeze, cough or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-containing disinfectants (alcohol content - at least 60%) hand-treated, but only when soap and water are not available. Regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These compositions use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable remedy for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen the immune system, personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and China's National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource - IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health care providers recommend opting for paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission, especially in health facilities, in procedures where airborne discharge may occur, such as intubation or hand drying.
The CDC recommends that medical professionals care for people with COVID-19 be placed in an air drop-drop unit (AIIR) - an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. The CDC has issued recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment (SIS) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection products and medical gloves. Of the above funds, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with emergency application permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used on non-instructional efficiency in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective facial screens or, as a last resort, making masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the form of COVID-19 is not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation or alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure is currently being actively studied, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with an intense airborne nasal cannula or two-tier positive pressure in the airways.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for critically ill patients as ventilator.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation if it is available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to nasal cannulas with intense airflow. The risk of severe disease for the elderly (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack per capita hospital beds, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilating, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of providing artificial ventilation is complicated, as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), developing in COVID-19, and oxygenation are increasingly problematic.
Inhal-enabled ventilator and PDKV are needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal damage to the ventilation that can cause pneumothorax to develop.
On earlier fan models, high PDSTs may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
The most promising is remdesivir.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers take part in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to use convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where human life is at serious or immediate risk.
It has not been clinically researched to prove the safety and efficacy of treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to control the outbreak.
To sign in, users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect "close contact" using surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people believed to be infected with coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers to german federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute.
Facial recognition technology has been introduced in Russia to identify quarantine offenders.
Italian Regional Commissioner for Health Giulio Gallera said that mobile network operators report that "40% of people still continue to move around the territory."
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon featuring more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can occur in a mild form with minor or absent symptoms reminiscent of other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as the common cold.
Patients with mild illness usually recover within two weeks, while it may take three to six weeks to treat patients with severe or critical forms.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of receiving severe COVID-19s based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar coVID-19 data are not available. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In those with the most severe course of disease COVID-19 can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
Thrombosis abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while impaired kidney function was observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transainase).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage case studies, the average time from initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by The National Health Commission of China, heart problems were increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had prior health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary by condition depending on these regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Not being able to calculate cases in an easy form can lead to an overestimation of mortality.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had their lungs reduced by 20 to 30 per cent, and their scans had revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to Post-Intensive Care Syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who had recovered from the virus developed a persistent immunity against it.
Judging by the flow of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but there have also been reported cases where, after recovery from COVID-19, coronavirus tests were still positive.
It is believed that in these cases there was an exacerbated protracted course of the disease, rather than re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its human-to-human transmission.
The study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date of the first case.
According to official figures released by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of spread of the disease, which are also affected by the amount of testing, the quality of health systems used, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency codes for ICD-10: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 infections for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a period of time.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This figure varies by region. Some other methods include the definition of disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, and the determination of the mortality rate as a result of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the characteristics of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have suffered the infection, the presence of such antibodies can understand how many people were infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castillionne d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) No longer alive.
In the town of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of the Carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, Germany's health system was not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by the indicators of donated blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The most at-risk group is men over the age of 50; the gender gap has been narrowing only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower smoking prevalence among women, comorbidities in men (e.g., hypertension, manifested in men at a younger age than in women) may be the cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of COVID-19 deaths were among men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nursing staff, are women, and therefore they are more likely to become infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, explains: "CO" means "crown," "VI" means "virus," "D" - "disease" (disease), and 19 - the year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public reports, WHO further uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19".
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "wunk coronavirus."
In January 2020, in accordance with 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended the use of the terms "acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names of the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2" were published.
Due to the limitations of standard supply chains, some manufacturers of digital services print medical materials, such as swabs for swabs from the nose, as well as the details of ventilators.
In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time, then one of the local productions was repurposed and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak first erupted, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects have spread at high speed on the Internet.
Humans may be infected with the virus of other animals.
Studies have not confirmed the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At the moment, there is no approved vaccine against the virus or drugs to treat it.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently under way by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial, which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds considered to be most effective to date.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are aiming to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is designed to trigger a rapid immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies aim to break down the S-chip protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of vaccine creation).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, Seattle began the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. The antibody amplification has been identified as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were for hydroxychloroukhin or chlorohin.
Reprofiling of antiviral drugs accounts for most of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for COVID-19 has been conducted. Several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered for the same purpose, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of remdesvir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already taking place in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese instructions of the 7th edition also list interferon, ribavirin or umiphenovir as a remedy against COVID-19.
Preliminary evidence indicates that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in low concentrations. Studies have shown that in order to penetrate SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to take the protein of the thorn transmebrained protease serin 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties of hypercytoconemia. A small study by China's National Health Commission included tocilizumab in the recommendations for coronavirus treatment.
This drug entered the second stage of a non-randomized test, which is carried out at the national level in Italy, after the positive results of its use in patients with severe disease were obtained.
Combined with a serum test for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies to treat steroid refractory cytokines release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokines release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is now regarded as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of PATIENTS from SARS, but its results have proved inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, can be increased.

Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian chain Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at once in all stores across the country to two and one packages respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were reported in ads at the box office, as well as on the network's Facebook page.
Citizens have reportedly begun to make emergency supplies because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths chain also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to four packages.
The Coles retailer said in a March 8 press release that with the introduction of a four-pack cap, "many stores are still buying toilet paper too quickly - one delivery within an hour" and called such demand "unprecedented," while ALDI called the trend "unexpected" in a Facebook post published on Tuesday.
A Woolworths spokesman said last week there had been a sharp rise in sales.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited that number to two packages.
To make up the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stock for a special early sale on Wednesday.
Russell zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to restock, but this was made difficult by local authorities' restrictions on trucking schedules.
He expects the cost of production to increase, as suppliers try to meet the demand, but at the same time less and less profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores were unable to hold promotions on Wednesdays due to dwindling stock.
In the report News.com.au Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the University of Technology NSW, said stores restocked every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the amount of inventory is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of shortage of stocks.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and items such as toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn't panic like that," says Russell zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap announced the end of the stock.
According to a News.com.au report, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet paper manufacturer of Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also manufactures Sorbent products, said they were working around the clock to provide enough goods.
Domain.com, a property website, said that when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to a lack of buyers during Labor Day week, some property sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
Thursday's edition of the Darwin-based NT News daily edition included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to an ABC Australia report dated March 3, stores were initially reluctant to impose limits on the number of items being purchased, saying they did not plan to do so.
He added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, gallantry, hand-washing products and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of toilet paper Andres to two packages of 12 rolls.

TEMA: "Covid-19" Load relief and preparation for the future
DATE/TIME TIME: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
RELATED: CC0: No Protected Rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have had no precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is the basis of such an organization.
We have seen a friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which was reflected in email correspondence, calls and chats - a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, we are working with amazing people.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And it's possible because of your work, whether it's to keep sites healthy, pay our colleagues, or protect community security.
The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and it is more important today than ever before.
At a time when it is important not only what we do to achieve meaningful results for the world, but also how we do it.
Due to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes to the way we work together, starting in the coming week.
Adjusting the order of our work and schedules
As Robin previously said, the "c-team" team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the course of communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
we expect to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours per week before further orders are received.
We do not announce a day off: if you can work normally for more hours, it is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
But the world is unpredictable now; Whatever your needs, whether it's taking care of your family, buying food or going to a doctor's appointment, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't keep track of your working time.
If you get sick, don't work.
This is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
You don't need to take a sick leave or time off: simply inform your supervisor and help the team revise the calendar and work schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed coVID-19 diagnosis, let Brian know from the T'C Ops unit so that T'C can provide support and proper attention from management to your situation.
Hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirm our intention to comply with our contractors and employees with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you can't work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in times like these.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask that you communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and be able to adjust your actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust'Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to evaluate current goals and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most meaningful projects.
Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work "twice as much to catch up" after the pandemic is over.
You don't need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines where possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to adjust to the new reality and expectations for the volume of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the terms of execution of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing employees to prioritise critical work, self-help and care, and with all those who need or want to work will be provided with a reduced timetable for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week we will present our proposal to the Council, informing representatives and teams of up-to-date information on the next steps as soon as we receive the relevant confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this work.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our san Francisco colleagues may be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to a lot of precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building has its own rules requiring caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our D.C. (D.C.) office is located on the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all staff in D.C. their RULES related to COVID-19.
Last week, our D.C. office completely moved to remote work in accordance with the san Francisco guidelines.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed renting a space in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one to two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them down into a course of several days.
Make clear the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and send out the materials in advance.
By default, use video communication to facilitate interaction and communication, and use tools like Google Docs and zoom to facilitate communication.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator, someone who will monitor the flow of questions in the chat room and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for keeping notes (or co-outline).
If you need to use a handy headset, contact technical support by email.
Take advantage of Wellness Reimbursement when you buy snacks.
Connect to slack's #remoties channel to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel mass wikimedia-funded events such as "editathons" until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of meeting agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for delays or changes to such objectives.
In the coming week, we will hold follow-up events with additional instructions on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general mood in the global community is not only a frustration with interruption, but also a sense of relief at understanding and being able to focus on your own communities, Wikimedia, and more.
As for perspective, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that provides community space to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch on ISSUES related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to further share up-to-date information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting to each other.
We are together in this situation and are ready to help as much as we can.
You can still receive information from this email, and other important information on COVID-19 can still be obtained from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, activities, key workflow, lighting issues, or if necessary, contact CRT.
We stand ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have privacy concerns, email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a rejection of our work and our commitments.
On the contrary, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and provide an opportunity to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and to create space for important work to come in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work as hard as possible as soon as the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Diagnostic criteria for "suspected disease" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published a short guide to diagnosing and treating the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides insights into our experience and provides sound recommendations to combat the pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice were also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected disease cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the document "Recommendations for Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19" (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself has been called "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a short guide and published it online on the website of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a lot of attention.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice were also continuously updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven issues of the coVID-19 Diagnostics and Therapy Recommendations document published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published, and the contents of some of its provisions have changed significantly.
Recently, the work, prepared by zhou and co-sponsors, commented on our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on the pandemic that has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of The Diagnostics and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19 (trial seventh) and the results of current research, their work needs updating.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (3 March 2020), one element of the epidemiological history characteristics with two clinical manifestations of the disease must be combined to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the suspected disease case:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or residences in and around Wuhan and other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surroundings or from other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (2 cases of high fever or respiratory symptoms recorded within 2 weeks in small areas such as a house or apartment, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) External manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) The total number of white blood cells is normal or lowered with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
Diagnosis for a confirmed case should be based on a suspected disease with one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genom sequencing of the virus shows a high homogeneity relative to new coronaviruses; (3) Positive results of serothest for specific for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG; or change the test result from negative to positive for the specific IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2, or an increase in the titre at least 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues of this document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples was added.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) issues; and then in the seventh issue, the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for the optimal set for the detection of nucleic acids during rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from the airways, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and promotes the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
However, there is growing evidence of the need to exercise caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of zhou and others should be updated, as it classifies persons without clinical symptoms as a "low-risk" group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to receiving more direct evidence and encourage readers to comment.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we invite readers to monitor and strictly follow the latest recommendations that are given in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 - daily high
Yesterday Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were reported, as well as 33 recovering patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were reported.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were the victims.
According to Dr Mirjabi, the two who died were over the age of 60, two aged between 51 and 60, and one aged 41 to 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
An employee of the clinic told the local Anadolu news agency that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Meitri Clinic.
In an online video appearance on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Kwader, said public transport would be halted for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport has been shut down since 26 March and was due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods - medicines, fuel and food - was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March in two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of 19 March, the three men had already recovered.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of coVID-19 infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
While the term "pandemic" only describes the extent of the disease, not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that governments need to take action:
"All countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic."
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, track cases, and mobilize their citizens," explained WHO Director-General Mr. Tedros Adan Ghbreisus.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no respiratory virus other than influenza has been tracked since its inception to its continuous global spread."
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and then gave it a new status: a pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse."
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people have died.
Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have experienced the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to be treated in hospital, or not at all.
The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests conducted in different countries was highly controversial.
These differences in information are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.
With a real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on airway samples obtained in a variety of ways, including a nasopharyngeal smear or a sputum sample.
Results are usually available within a period of several hours to 2 days.
OT-PCR test, conducted on smears taken from the throat, is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, however, continuing to multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, the alternative may be to take material from the lower respiratory tract with a sucking catheter, or it is possible to use products of sputum (sputum).
One of the earliest TESTS of PCR was developed at the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and underpinned 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its own test. On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for detecting SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR Clinical Level (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the "E" gene, common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain permission from the National Medicines Administration of China to use the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit on the basis of PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes its real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency application permit. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR across the country.
Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 across the country on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were announced; the collection and processing of the tests must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Vector State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Diagnostic Roches received FDA approval to use the test, which can be conducted for 3.5 hours on a large sample volume, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; The FDA has previously issued similar permits to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermic nucleic amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because this test does not require a series of cycle cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can show positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S., and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody is currently being developed in Taiwan, which specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and there is hope that results can be obtained in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express flu test.
A review of specialized literature for March 2020 concluded that "chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT results may have such value even before symptoms occur."
Typical traits detected during the CT include bilateral multi-dose subplebural sealing focuses on the type of "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and apostereurical distribution.
Subpleural dominance, cobblestone and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT scans were significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincided with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in COVID-19 diagnostics." As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using the PCR method for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control. Analyses can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT typically uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.
With PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncturing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood collection stage is not required to take a test test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency permit test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.
The performance of testing is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore this method works much faster than the usual PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had acquired produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspected virus to stay at home: "Emergency department staff pass a test tube to the patient for a sample," the patient spits in it, gives back and after a while receives the results of the test. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of patient contamination by other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it is used to transport a patient. During rapid testing on COVID-19 in suspicious cases, the health care worker takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centers have helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On March 2, germany's National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said it was ready to conduct about 12,000 outpatient tests a day, and a week earlier they could do just 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany's overall test performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct rapid testing in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 analyses were taken on SARS-CoV-2, up to week 12/2020, and 33,491 (6.9%) of the sample. the result was positive. Researchers at The Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample shows a positive result. In Wuhan, bgi opened a 2,000-square-metre temporary laboratory on 5 February 2020. an emergency detection called Huo-Yan (chinese 火眼 or "Fire Eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jiang and completed in just 5 days; modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore the cost of quarantine would have also been twice as high.
Behind the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex origami Assays schemes have been released, which can test up to 1,122 patients on COVID19 using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced structures can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the shortage and insufficient number of reagents, mass testing in the EU, UK and US became problematic.
As a result, some of the authors turned to test sample processing protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) within 5 minutes in order to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the level of coronavirus testing currently carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita was higher than in any other country, and that a large proportion of the population would soon be tested.
This was due to the ability to conduct rapid testing, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (created on the basis of their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first such large-scale laboratory operating outside of China.
Different testing options for different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the production of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Health and Epidemiology Centers was not available until January 28, resulting in a lack of test kits in the United States. At the outset of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits recommended by health experts.
But in South Korea, according to experts, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing capabilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many private U.S. laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of tests, were overwhelmed, and stocks of materials for swabs and chemical reagents quickly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
U.S. test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws," and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private development of tests. Spain purchased the test kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccurate results may be the failure of sampling or improper use of kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall the inaccurate kits and replace them with other kits, Shenzhen Bioeasy kits. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic acquired in China gave the wrong results. The 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic offered to dump them in danube. Atesh Kara, a health official at Turkey's Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a "high level of errors" and the ministry "did not use them." The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that the kits were unusable.
The quarantine measures for those whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as the monitoring of people with whom such patients were in contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaugh, where coVID-19 first died in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, at an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
The entrance to the settlement was closed and this measure completely stopped the spread of infection.
With intensive contact tracking, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and shops were not necessary.
Many events there were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began urging residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on 23 March have opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also responded to the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries with more tests than deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmable testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following graph, the "% positive results" column depends on the country-specific testing policy.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage positive result than the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of whether symptoms of the virus are present, all other things being equal.
Rapidly increasing rate of cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the Eurozone/European Economic Area and in the UK, thus confirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, it is necessary to improve the level of preparedness for the influx of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, China's Hubei Province.
On 9 January 2020, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) was the cause of infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the available data to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 disease is mild, i.e. in the form of respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with the majority of patients recovering.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease with the need for hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% it takes a critical form when intensive care is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) /EU/European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK and compares them to trends in China's Hubei Province.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK with those for Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is now developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met WHO's criteria for the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on 24 January 2020, with all three returning from Wuhan, China's Hubei Province.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths, including 17,750 deaths, including 1,441 deaths, between 31 December 2019 and the date of that date.
Determining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily data on the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country of the world at 8:00 a.m. from official sources such as the ministries of health in those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases, COVID-19 was calculated to have a truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in 14 days, taking into account the normal flow of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in eu/EEA countries and in the UK
Trends in the development of truncated covid-19 cumulative incidence over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole were in line with trends observed in China's Hubei Province (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to increase around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK there were similar trends towards an increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
On rice. 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK compared to the same number for Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
According to these figures, the total number of cases already reported as of 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
Observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response to national public health authorities, and possibly different case recognition criteria and different rules for patient selection for COVID-19 analysis, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already as full as possible.
At the moment, data on the admission of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available only for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data are not presented).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such information in order to supplement current observational data, which are the subject of the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a 2010-2011 study, there is a significant disparity in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The ECDC's sixth updated COVID-19 Risk Assessment Report presents scenarios for modelling the loading of health systems resources with estimates for hospitalization of COVID-19 infected people in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of shortage of affordable beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped into specific regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a population of a particular territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to be provided as far as possible by Units 2 of the Territorial Units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a LONG-term SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which can be seen in the affected regions of Italy, for example.
As reported in the latest ECDC rapid risk assessment report, an expeditious, proactive and integrated approach with the subsequent shift from deterrence to minimization of impacts is important in containing the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to reflect, adopt and adjust their responses accordingly, should such measures not be taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a small period of time during which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
Failure to do so, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The zoonous origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated coevolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoV) cause a mild disease such as the common cold.
Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus can be.
The appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 once again drew attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission, but more mild pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related sars-CoV virus.
A person's coronavirus infection is a zoonnosis, and understanding its zoonous origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs carrying some human coronaviruses are also known.
The identification of animal carriers has a direct impact on preventing the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals carrying coronaviruses may also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we provide available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their history of detection, as well as their zoonotic origins and modes of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we compare and compare different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of coronavirus disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, there are conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers, and the effect of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the Family Coronaviridae, which is a group of wrapping viruses with one positive polar filament RNA.
These viruses, with the largest genome of RNA-containing viruses, with a genome of 26 to 32,000 nucleotides, were named due to their form, which, when examined under an electron microscope, resembles a corona.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins of pp1a and pp1ab replicas.
These polyproteins are then processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins designated nsp1/16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including thorn-like protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines of coronaviruses also encoded a number of linearly specific accessory proteins.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacoonaviruses), with the type of betacoronaviruses comprising most human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoonaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some have evolved to dangerous human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses have been known.
These include human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus of type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively larger numbers of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARI) and extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first floss of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample separating from the nasopharynx of patients who contracted a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has provided more detailed knowledge of the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were ill and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long-running epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
Discovered in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 had claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of people infected had exceeded 91,000.
An alarming signal has been received and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have zoonous origin, their sources are bats, mice or pets.
Numerous data sets show in favor of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to whose organisms viruses are well adapted and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but demonstrate widespread genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
The study of the zoonous mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will allow to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and factors limiting interspecies transport.
It may also prompt or accelerate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, which is important to prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This review provides general information on zoonous origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we designate and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are not usually pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the trend of human coronavirus evolution, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of nasopharynx-treated patients with colds, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and graphical history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was derived from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract lesions in 1966; this virus has since adapted to reproduction in the LINES of the WI-38 pulmonary cells.
Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with high fever and coughing observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of sucker mice.
Clinical signs of infection with the HCoV-OC43 virus appear to be similar to those of HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are ubiquitous worldwide and are usually transmitted in winter at temperate latitudes.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.
According to a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed the common cold of mild form.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the "SARS epidemic," was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the SARS-CoV virus, the third identified human coronavirus, was the cause.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
Excluding overactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had muscle pain, headaches, high fever, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough and respiratory failure.
Common deviations of laboratory indicators from the norm in SARS are lymphoping, disturbances in liver samples and elevated levels of creatine kinase.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages levels.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, other organs, including gastrointestinal organs, liver and kidneys, may also be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tract, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for immunocompromised patients.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open lung biopsy by a relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to research human coronaviruses.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands.
It was initially found to mainly affect young children, the elderly and immunocompromised and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, such manifestations as runny nose, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolithic are characteristic.
Another independent study describes the secretion of the same virus from the nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus has been detected in the Netherlands, but it is actually ubiquitous.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of diseases it causes is the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called cereal.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with an exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation, which entails highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were unknown and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to effectively transmit and persist in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia imported cases and spread through sporadic secondary infections through close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome with high mortality rates (34.4%) have been reported, making MERS-CoV considered one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
Between mid-december 2019 and the end of December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, China, which is now associated with an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The World Health Organization has declared that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed "coronavirus infection 19" (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in China's Hubei province is 4.2% and outside the province of 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly develop into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
THE SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transmission capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly around the world.
Comparisons and comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and six other human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and duration of the disease they have caused.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of symptoms COVID-19 is found between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to that most commonly observed in human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe CASES of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission plan also has interesting patterns typical of both human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as in human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 is reduced with each subsequent transition (i.e. infection of each next person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in feces samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least under certain circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the specifics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustained distribution after human transition.
All four human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections with mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it may be people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human coronaviruses in the past.
Human coronaviruses, which cause severe diseases in humans, and people whose human coronaviruses cause severe diseases, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract media restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four out-of-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating in the population, causing common colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
Highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
They need to persist and multiply in their zoonous reservoirs and look for cases of being hit by susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has traits similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four non-hospital HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as an out-of-hospital HCoV, at least for now.
But it is more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts fully to humans and whether it will circulate in a human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and unpathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the carrier-reservoir constantly transfers HCoV over time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are the natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only entered into an intermediate medium right before or so the time it was brought in by a person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonous source of human infection and act as a amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to replicate quickly and then passing it on to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can tolerate a dead-end infection if it cannot withstand transmission within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to intermediate media and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate media becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals (wild).
Further studies of seropervalence have shown that animal traders have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus than in the general population.
Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in the markets of live animals became the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical TO SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that SARS cases were no longer reported after the destruction of all civets in the markets.
At the same time, it was reported that himalayan cyvets living in nature or on farms and not entering the markets were in most cases not identified by SARS-CoV, suggesting that the Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate booster, not a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that numerous species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate boosters.
All of them seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV identified a closely related CoV of bats, which was named as the HKU3 subconic bat coronavirus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88 to 92% of the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in bats, but none of them, except for one that denotes WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
It is known that the SARS-CoV receptor is the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from a sample of bat faeces, has been shown to use ACE2 bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
Curiously, serums of convalescent patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
Today, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally considered to be not a direct parent of the SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis classifies MERS-CoV as the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptypeptidase-4 (DPP4), to infiltrate viruses.
The sequences of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to the sequences of bat betacoronaviruses detected in Europe and Africa.
Until now, wild bats have not found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homologies of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats coincide only by 87%.
That is, bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-breasted camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the thous strokes of single-breasted camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels, experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, had minor symptoms, but massive viruses.
It is noteworthy that infected camels isolated the virus not only by respiratory pathway, but also by fecal-oral pathway, which is also the main way of excreting the virus in bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have had no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms and are plausible for human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that carry MERS-CoV.
The sars-CoV-2 nucleotide homology is 96.2% identical to the CoV RaTG13 bats isolated from Asian horseshoes Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute to them parental relationships.
That is, bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical bat coronaviruses were found in the future.
Presumably, the direct animals carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Uhan wholesale seafood market, which has been associated with many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely case of transmission from animal to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenome sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also have carried the parent betacoronavirus, a parent strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homoology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes is 85-92% identical to SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with the identity at the nucleotide sequence level being about 90%.
They cluster in two sub-zones of differentiation of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
On the contrary, RSD strains OF SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of homology sequences throughout the genome.
An earlier study of pangolins also reported the identification of viral contigues in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other assembling and manual processing techniques to produce a genome sequence that includes about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It cannot be ruled out that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 betakoronviruses, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest homology sequences were found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolina betacoronviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 had the highest homology sequences in the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal advocates recombination between betacorona pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force behind evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonous origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonous origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may occur from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are detected in rodents.
It has been reported that bat coronavirus, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in the North American tricolor sucker, demonstrates a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier may have been camel.
To be clear, modern knowledge about the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The philogenetic analysis gave evidence of the events of the interspecies transmission of HCoV in history.
When interspecies transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred around 1890 and humans became infected from pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of the interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alphacoronaviruses of bats, closely-native HCoV-229E were found.
Between them is the alphacoronavirus alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could come into contact with bats in the general ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, alphacoronavirus bats, related to HCoV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alcoronavirus alpacas have caused a respiratory disease attack in infected animals.
Finally, the alaconavirus alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas received alphacoronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it's no surprise that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while alphacoronaviruses in bats could serve as a gene pool of the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and single-breasted camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is a perfect example of interspecies transmission from bats to single-breasted camels and from one-breasted camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its initial identification and has since been confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats "perfect distributors."
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single-breasted camels decades ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate carrier into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low incidence of mutations.
Its episodic transmission to the person is an accident, and the person remains a dead-end carrier of MERS-CoV, as his transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, betacoronaviruses of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be dead-end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities of interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans should be confirmed or eliminated.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats thanks to coal mining or cutting of the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, pangolins can be one of the intermediate amplifying carriers in which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus recently got.
People become infected with the virus through carcass cutting and eating wild meat.
It is possible that many animals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in the third form, which came into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the SARS-CoV-2 animal is ongoing.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, three main factors on the part of viruses also contributed to the intersection of interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with single-chain RNA, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately high" with an average frequency of substitutions of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year at one site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of coronavirus to new owners.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs that need to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the incidence of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is probably lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-breasted camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA gene in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification in relation to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses in the presence of appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3-end genome.
Third, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrix during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixture vessel, the filaments are often switched.
High-biological full-size and subgenomal RNAs can recombinate and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Interaction of the carrier virus in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor important for interspecies transmission.
This article provides the SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV strains and civets, SARS-CoV is thought to be rapidly adapting in different media, especially with regard to mutations in the RSD protein S.
In general, the RSD protein S coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the respondent of the carrier's antibody intensely selects it.
RSD in SARS-CoV is an amino acid, from 318th to 510th, on a fragment of S1, which binds to angiotensin-distorting enzyme 2 (AFP2) of a person, as well as its corioceptors, to introduce the virus into the cell.
SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to recognize THE2 receptors of different animals, including bat, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, making interspecies transmission of the virus possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD, which differ from human and civet virus strains, 4 of which are in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets has mutations K479N and S487T in RSD, which can increase the affinity of the interaction of the spiked protein with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for the virus's adaptation to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S segment leads to the fact that the binding affinity of protein S to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectron microscope suggests that the affinity for this link is 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and sars-CoV virus S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors were required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with another segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors such as aminepeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsial acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and restriction of the carrier.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers HCoVs, such as bats, single-breasted camels and rodents, can represent a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission of HCoV viruses, dependence factors have to be usurped and media restriction factors are subordinated.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Unbiased full-genom screening of dependence factors and restriction of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 with the latest CRISPR technology can produce good results.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to zero
The diversity of bat coronaviruses creates ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the sarssor proteins, SARS-CoV is considered to be ORF8, as BAT viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but they have been found to encode ORF8 divergent proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, 29-nucleotide division, characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses, was detected.
This division breaks orF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates media change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gamma-corononvirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localizations have also been identified in non-structural nsp9 proteins, most nsp10s and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been recombinant between different lines, which occurred in one-mountain camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which is most likely the result of ridding the virus of selective pressures, such as from the carrier's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E strain due to binucleotide division.
While the ORF4 atomic reading can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alacitosana alphacoronavirus alpaca demonstrates a single-nucleotide insertion, which leads to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.
When bats are infected with coronaviruses, there were mild or no symptoms, indicating a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the apregation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main complex of histocompanyity of the first class.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is provided by high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of coronavirus, while affecting the reading of exoribonuclease, thus creating a selection pressure to generate strains of the virus, which when penetrated into the new carrier are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that in the last twenty years there have been three new human coronaviruses.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They are confidently replicated without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, asymptomatic carriers have no immune response associated with coronavirus replication.
The same immune response strategy may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, taking type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma has been disrupted in bats.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While bat betacoronavirus, which is 95% identical to SARS-CoV, has been found to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV, there is also bat coronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 96% consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Betacoronaviruses of pangolin, the strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, were found to suggest that pangolins may have served as an intermediate carrier or that fragments of pangolins betacoconvirus genes could have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by a human.
Coronaviruses have attracted worldwide attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonous origin and HCoV animal reservoirs in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If the SARS-CoV infection comes from human-civet contact in the markets, the closure of the game markets and the destruction of the civet on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of a variety of lines of betacoronaviruses, pangolins, closely related SARS-CoV-2, to prevent zoonous transmission from food markets should remove pangolins.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this may occur remains a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has existed for a long time in single-breasted camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for control of MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the world.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonous potential are extremely diverse.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonous coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and/or more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After the ordeal of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations is needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be captured.
While many bat properties are beneficial for the spread of viruses, if you teach humans to stay away from them, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife.
To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonous viruses.
The SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First, if bats have transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of true intermediate carrier is played by a third mammal, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
