how long have these symptoms been present?
and all chest pain should be treated this way, especially considering your age
and together with high temperature
and you also need to check your cholesterol and blood pressure
and do you have a high fever now?
and are you experiencing this chest pain right now?
and besides, is it hard for you to breathe
and can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides these?
and how high was your temperature
and I also have a cough

do you still have chest pain
since this is the flu season
but we also should not be left without attention due to the presence of pain in the chest, which is of a cardiological nature
however, now a more important problem is this chest pain
but my breathing is difficult
but I know that a lot of people cough on me
but we must approach the treatment of any chest pain with maximum severity
but you are breathing well now, right?
because I don’t remember about this pain in the chest

COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to help in an epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying individuals (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many regions have developed or proposed many applications officially supported by the authorities.
Several contact tracking application options have been developed.
This has created a discussion about privacy issues, especially for those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate the support functionality of such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, has launched an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, it is open source and will be transferred to government control. Northern Macedonia has launched the StopKorona! Application, which runs on Bluetooth, helps you keep track of contacts with potentially infected people, and allows you to communicate quickly with your healthcare provider.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracking application is in the final stages of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore-based TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use the application with the geofence function, the purpose of which is to ensure that patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at the University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if the application is used only by a small fraction of the population.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious “coronavirus” applications, Apple has limited the list of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, including only “official” or other trusted organizations in this list.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Confidentiality campaigners expressed concern about the effects of mass surveillance through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question was raised whether the monitoring infrastructure designed to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat disappears.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of supervision.
Organizations have announced eight conditions for government projects:
observation must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
enhanced monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by limitation clauses;
data use should be limited by the objectives of controlling the spread of COVID-19
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and evidence must be provided;
digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
“meaningful participation” of all “relevant stakeholders” should be ensured, including public health experts and representatives of marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to solve the problem of constant monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as this is no longer necessary.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of applications, eliminating the need to download the application and avoiding tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have major potential privacy issues.
However, not all central server systems must have access to personal location data; A number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers for communication only (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used to track contacts that did not use applications as a basis.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data of mobile devices and transactions with cards, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but also made the whereabouts information publicly available, which was made possible due to significant changes in the information protection legislation that were introduced after the outbreak of MERS in this country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and confidentiality systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been made public.
Contact tracing, which maintains confidentiality, is an established concept, a significant amount of research literature on which dates back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, over ten expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts, which include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include confidentiality decentralized tracing (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that maintains confidentiality when collecting and using location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on studies in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform. developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to share confidential location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of this data.
On April 5, 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols established the TCN global coalition, whose goal is to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key factor in their widespread distribution.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the mobile platforms of Android and iOS, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure privacy, which was based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to keep confidentiality.
They also published technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deploying tools that allow governments to create official applications to track the movement of coronavirus infected citizens, but with data privacy
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant monitoring by first implementing the system through updating the operating system and then deleting it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Hand washing, also known as “hand hygiene,” is the process of cleansing your hands to remove contaminants, grease, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
A person can also become infected with respiratory illnesses, such as the flu or a common cold, for example, by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical points during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after bowel movements, after washing the baby’s buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and homemade birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after patient care procedures.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
Hand hygiene refers to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical goal of handwashing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Hand washing is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and also reduces the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study showed that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap and water.
This elementary procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of handwashing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea may be due to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Almost 3.5 million children die from diarrhea and pneumonia as a whole.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet, which has become a strong habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections - a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents the occurrence of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin, and, consequently, to its damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that washing your hands too often can lead to itchy and flaky skin - a disease known as eczema or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common among healthcare professionals.
Washing your hands too often can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the buttocks of the baby (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before taking food and before / after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases when you should wash your hands to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or blowing your nose, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching debris.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is not common.
A handwashing study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries showed that on average 38.7% of households washing their hands with soap and water is a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; The USA in this list is closer to the middle, their indicator is 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China - 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behavior and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group washing of hands at schoolchildren at a set time of the day is one such methodology that helps to teach children to do this.
The Emergency Medical Care Program, implemented by the Philippines Department of Education, is an example of large-scale interventions to promote child health and children's education.
This national program is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride.
The same program has been successfully carried out in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin occurs more efficiently if soap or detergents are added during washing.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water alone is not considered an effective skin cleanser, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic contaminants, are poorly soluble in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the purification process.
A solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may get on it during previous use.
A small number of studies on getting bacteria onto the skin from a contaminated bar of solid soap suggests that it’s not likely to get into it, because the bacteria are washed off with foam.
The CDC still claims that “Hand-Operated Liquid Soap is the preferred option for handwashing.”
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are antibiotic resistant in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective for antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be as advertised.
In addition to a surfactant and skin protection products, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, lactic) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that, in terms of preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin of the hands, simple soaps are just as effective as regular antibacterial soaps containing triclosan.
Hot water of a temperature comfortable for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37 ° C.
However, to remove natural fats that hold contaminants and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer (sanitizer) or hand sanitizer is a water-free hand hygiene product.
Water-free hand hygiene products (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers or sanitizers) began to gain popularity in the late 1990s and early 21st centuries.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, providing ease of use of these products and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing a minimum of 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tubercle bacillus, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of the bacteria (a logarithm reduction of 3.5 is similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% - 99.999% of bacteria (a logarithm of reduction 4-5) per hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of an antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent to thoroughly treat and soak the skin of the hands on both sides.
The front and back surfaces of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel is completely absorbed.
The fingertips on both hands should also be washed thoroughly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing a hand wash rather than a disinfectant, especially if your hands are very dirty.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to the ease of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, however, they should not serve as a substitute for proper hand washing, if it is possible to use water and soap.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain emollients and / or skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other emollients to the composition of the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants practically do not occur.
The lower likelihood of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in favor of the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free products do not cleanse the hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as regular soap and water, because when using such tools, pathogenic microorganisms still remain on hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on components and composition, and historically has been significantly lower than alcohol or alcohol-based products.
More recently, it has been proven that drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommends using a hand washing technique that includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is precisely running water that is recommended, because standing water may be contaminated, but the temperature of the water just does not matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as the area between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (and not just water alone), people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.
Rinsing hands in still water can provoke re-infection.
Dry your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.
Wet and damp hands become more easily contaminated. Most often, people disregard areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottle gourd with holes made and / or using ash if necessary, as is the case, for example, in developing countries. In places with limited water supplies (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions exist, such as foot-operated taps and other low-cost options.
A faucet with a foot pedal is a simple design consisting of a container suspended on a rope and a foot lever that must be pressed so that water pours on your hands; a bar of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Symposium on the Production of Paper Napkins and Towels; The subject of this study was a comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, warm air hand dryers and more modern stream air hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increases on average by 194%, and on the palms - by 254%.
It also turned out that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with air flow, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increases by 42%, and on the palms - by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips on average decreases to 76%, and on the palms to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to the toilet rooms and the environment of the toilet with each type of drying.
The air-jet dryer, which releases air at the declared speeds of 180 m / s (650 km / h, 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms from its hands and from its own unit and potentially infect other users of the toilet room and bathroom within a radius of 2 meters .
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
When using paper towels, a significant spread of microorganisms was not detected. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study evaluating various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying with paper towels.
Cleansing your hands with disinfectant wipes can be an alternative when traveling without soap and water.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices really helps to reduce infection.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, while using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to rinse them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying hands, closing the tap, and also, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, use a paper towel.
This avoids re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in medical institutions is the removal of pathogenic microorganisms (“microbes”) and the prevention of their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to the results of one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the level of bloodstream infections associated with the use of a catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard procedure for washing and treating hands, which should be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO hand hygiene manual is also available on its website and is open to public comment.
A related review was conducted by Whitby in collaboration.
If regulatory compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure performance and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization refers to the “five points” when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or body fluids,
before using an antiseptic as well
after patient care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap while washing your hands (“medical” or “antimicrobial” soap) helps kill bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment with a high content of antibiotic-resistant organisms. To "cleanse" the hands before surgery, a crane is required that can be turned on and off without touching it with your hands; You should also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse your hands, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterile rubbing brush and other sterile tools to clean under your nails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually within 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to rub your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.
After washing, hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after the procedures for caring for a sick person.
To combat staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of washing was most beneficial for handwashing, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of handwashing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, washing your hands with regular soap leads to a more than three-fold increase in the frequency of bacterial infections transmitted through food. A comparison of rubbing hands with an alcohol-containing solution and washing hands with an antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that treating hands with an alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcoholic solutions for hands in terms of reducing the amount of H1N1 influenza virus and Clostridium spores on the hands. Measures to develop hand hygiene in medical facilities may include training for staff in hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand solutions, and written and verbal reminders to staff about the need to wash their hands.
More research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various medical facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a stable water supply, soap or handwash in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to instill the habit of washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand taps, although there are cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by ingrained habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap and water can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term changes in population behavior.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate the results.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-level sanitary and epidemiological surveillance is effective in improving hand hygiene in lower middle-income countries, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of propaganda regarding handwashing in schools is the Three Star Approach approach of the United Nations Children's Fund: it advocates the implementation of simple, cost-effective measures in schools that encourage students to wash their hands with soap and other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can upgrade their level from one to three stars.
Installation of washstands is one of the possible measures implemented as part of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 year coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of emoji, symbolizing handwashing.
Some studies have examined the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to DALYs (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating handwashing with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for vulnerable people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers in hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and "founder of modern patient care."
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by putrefactive odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections associated with medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA began to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have begun to better understand how important it is to wash hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, next to washstands in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports, posters were hung with the "right hand washing techniques."
The phrase "wash your hands" means a manifestation of your unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be a participant in something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; subsequently, this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain symbolizing an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed an unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than other people, and for them washstands are more important.
Also, it is less likely that people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after what they saw would participate in any other “cleansing” compensating events, for example, in volunteer activities.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided in many religions, including Baha'ism, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require the obligatory washing of hands after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries around the world , and the number of infected exceeded 80,000.
Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity of the disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than young people and more often than men.
In response to the skyrocketing publication of a new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive review of a rapidly developing research subject.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of the further course and prevention of this disease.
Although answers to many questions have yet to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25 in 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people who were urged to stay home during the holiday and for many weeks after the outbreak of a new viral infection.
Given the high degree of similarity to coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the concomitant disease - coronavirus infection 19 ( COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country, and then to almost 50 other countries in the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified, more than 40,000 patients recovered, more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy in society" and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 publications about COVID-19 appeared, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting from the first report of January 7, 2020, in which the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients was determined.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by coronavirus - the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, the outbreak of which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss currently known facts about the prevention and prognosis of the course of the disease, as well as some other equally urgent issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause approximately 15% of total respiratory diseases 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e. the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of diseases originally in China in 2003 year and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with a terrifying level of severity of the disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in fig. Fig. 1.1, a report of clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received by the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
January 15, 2020 recorded the first death in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of health workers, which suggested the possibility of transmission of the virus from person to person.
On January 23, quarantine was introduced in Wuhan, and city public transport stopped working.
On January 24, according to the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contacts with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing this report, the disease spread throughout China and has already spread to approximately 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig. 2) .2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final extent and severity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, according to the results of a multicenter clinical study in which 8 866 patients took part, including 4 021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, the following updated picture of the epidemic development was presented (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/ s / UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infection was exposed to all age groups, but people aged 30 to 65 were mostly ill.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men (0.31 / 100,000) than among women (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed in clusters mainly in Hubei and the surrounding regions.
On average, 5 (2–9) days elapsed from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
From the onset of symptoms to death, an average of 9.5 (4.8–13) days passed.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51–4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23–4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected people, coinciding in time with large-scale transport traffic on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4.59% )
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (≥60), and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing one strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans.
In the case of coronaviruses of the SARS and MERS type, the glycoprotein of the sheath-shaped spine processes (S) binds to the cellular receptors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme of type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA, together with enveloped glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% identical to 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak outbreak in the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrathin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the human ACE2 enzyme more weakly than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease of lesser severity in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Protein orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play a role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-length human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 Å in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence for the recognition of coronavirus and its infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through civet and camels, respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to two coronaviruses similar to SARS, namely the coronaviruses of bats SL-CoVZX45 and SL- CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what species became an intermediate host, thanks to which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the transmission route also remains to be seen.
Mr. Ji and colleagues suggested that snakes became the carriers of the virus from bats to humans, resulting in homologous recombination in S protein.
Based on the results of their research, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins, long-nosed mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference distributed between the two genomes is still very large; therefore, it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are for the most part still unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 ° C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat to 56 ° C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethyl alcohol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively block the activity of the virus.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4) .4).
Typically, the virus that enters the host organism first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognition receptors (OPP), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4 + T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8 + T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protective cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the function of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from the recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overreaction of the immune system entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The probability of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have impaired immune systems.
According to the results of studying the data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3–7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted an average of 3 days, with a spread of 0 to 24 days.
The later study described above, based on demographic data from 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the terms of quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected in whom the disease is asymptomatic.
A 14-day quarantine has been common practice for people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high fever, which may be the only manifestation or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
In some patients, shortness of breath and / or hypoxia were noted one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and / or symptoms of respiratory illness and acute fever should be checked for the virus in order to make an early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies in the chest photographs.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptom prevalence rates: 98% - high fever, 76% - dry cough, 55% - shortness of breath, and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients required mechanical ventilation.
Similar results were obtained as a result of two recent studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected people.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required mechanical ventilation, this figure is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are fever (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), shortness of breath (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%) and sore throat (13–25%), and mechanical ventilation requires 14–20% of patients.
On February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Compared to this indicator, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71–7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 are shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with a new virus is lower compared to the last two.
Thus, it will be much harder to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestation often occurs when an infection occurs within the same family or group of people gathered together for any reason or caught together in some kind of transport, for example, on a cruise ship.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted those who were infected or sick during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, according to the data presented in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients who leave the hospital can again become carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia with a leukocyte count of &lt;4 × 109 / L, including a leukocyte count of &lt;1 × 109 / L, as well as an increased level of asparagine aminotransferase and viremia.
In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin were found, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood.
In patients with a severe course of the disease, the level of D-dimer, the breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
In the majority of patients with COVID-19, an X-ray examination of the chest revealed pathologies characterized by uneven blackouts on both sides or “frosted glass” blackouts in the lungs.
Patients often develop SARS, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory disease (ARI).
With the development of acute respiratory infections, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant violation of gas exchange.
Type I and II pneumocyte dysfunction lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Thus, the worst x-ray results often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detachment of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, and the multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory infections and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, we used the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection method by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase PCR).
However, given the high level of false-negative results, which could accelerate the pace of the epidemic's development, from February 13, 2020, China began to make a diagnosis based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on reverse transcriptase PCR).
A similar situation was with the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the data of the medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and the results of x-ray studies.
On February 14, 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the protocol for applying the SHERLOCK technique based on the CRISPR repeat to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the identification of synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 20 × 10–18 mol / L to 200 × 10–18 mol / L (10–100 copies per microliter of the initial sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new technique, if it is successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and the convenience of their conduct.
Due to the lack of experience in counteracting a previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide patients with COVID-19 only supportive therapy, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or suggested in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and also other viral diseases (table (Table 2) .2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immune suppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
For treatment, it was proposed to use even the plasma of recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs and, possibly, to a lesser extent affects other organs expressing ACE2, for example, the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, malfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause the death of patients.
Thus, in order to alleviate symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified technique for extrapulmonary circulation used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the functions of vital organs is critical for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of an overreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the isolation of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release a huge amount of free radicals, which become the main reason for the development of acute respiratory infections and multiple organ failure.
In the treatment of a cytokine storm, especially in patients in serious condition, suppression of immunity is of utmost importance.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as an inhibitor of interleukin-6, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other methods of treating a cytokine storm based on suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T cells; blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of Janus kinase; the use of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histone deacetalase inhibitors.
To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immune suppressants.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in treating severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium dosages are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has proven to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola virus and Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Relying on these data, Gilead provided the drug to China to conduct paired studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are looking forward to.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir / ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
Blood sampling in patients who have been cured of a contagious disease has been used for a long time to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect a healthy population.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to combat the pathogen.
Antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual molecules of pathogens and targetedly neutralize them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples of a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, in order to propose the widespread use of this method before carrying out specific therapy, an as yet unverified verification and not compiled explanations are required.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, one should carefully study some of the disadvantages associated with the use of plasma.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and a lot of plasma is needed to treat critically ill patients.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to overcome the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of the recovered patients and determine the genetic code of the effective antibodies or to screen to find effective antibodies against the critical proteins of the virus.
So we can immediately go to the mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, the Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness largely depends on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have an indefinite effect, since it is difficult to isolate and verify these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy for COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treating patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of recovered patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces in China that used Chinese traditional medicine to treat 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%). whereas in Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, the lowest percentage of people who recovered (13%) was recorded.
However, this is a rather crude comparison, since the assessment should be carried out taking into account many other factors of influence, for example, the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published materials from a study that compared treatment solely with Western medicine and combination treatment with Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the terms for normalizing body temperature, eliminating symptoms and providing medical care in a hospital were significantly shorter in patients for whom a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods were used than in patients who were treated only using Western methods.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients whose symptoms began to worsen (from mild to severe) was noticeably lower in the group treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only with Western methods (7.4% compared with 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared with 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of certain interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and explain aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in the methods of Chinese traditional medicine, or a combination thereof.
Patients who suspect or have confirmed the presence of COVID-19 generally have a strong fear of an acute and even fatal disease, while quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of an SARS virus outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses have been reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma among their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and contact with them, as well as all other people who need it.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary teams of psychiatric care should be formed, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updating of information about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the chain of transmission from animal carriers of infection and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work was done to create vaccines based on S-protein, the purpose of which is to develop long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live attenuated vaccines for SARS viruses.
However, before the start of clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the efficacy of these possible vaccines in vivo when used in age-related patients, the lethal dose infection model, and the degree of protection against infection by zoonotic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new cases have been reported.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of the disease caused by the MERS virus, originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions due to the conservation of zoonotic sources in the endemic habitats, continue to manifest themselves.
To combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long period (on average 18 months) required for developing a vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
Being a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show the full picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe illness.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to draw up a prognostic model of the disease in order to determine the priority of their measures, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on the current clinical studies, the following factors can influence or predict the course of the disease in patients with COVID-19 (table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, of which 47.7% are over 50, according to the data from the aforementioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and they were significantly older than those patients who did not require such therapy (on average 66 versus 51 years), which indicates that age is prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events have also been a leading cause of death for patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely interrelated and can distort the results.
Deviations detected in laboratory tests: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to consider it as a potential prognostic factor in the course of the disease, reaction to therapy, and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease, and the prognosis for COVID-19.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase can also predict the outcome.
These enzymes in large quantities are secreted by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
The main clinical symptoms: to predict the results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, one should take into account the data of an X-ray examination of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immune suppressants that are widely used in infectious diseases as adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors have developed avascular osteonecrosis, leading to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if it is necessary to use steroids for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, because they often have to withstand long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological consultations and long-term support must be provided with them.
According to current demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can multiply successfully in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all in the early stages of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or the incubation period has not yet ended, can lead their normal lives to spread the virus on a significant scale, which greatly complicates the epidemiological control.
However, it was believed that SARS-CoV virus transmission occurs when patients are seriously ill, despite the fact that in most cases there was no early infection.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic and is more difficult to control.
A lot of work is underway in China, under which universal quarantine has been declared in Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the quarantine regime has been extended for almost the entire population, introduced in order to interrupt the SARS-CoV-2 virus distribution chain.
Although these measures are causing enormous damage to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients detected is declining, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end by March, and the decay phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues calculated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group, led by Ira Longini, designed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nasal and throat swabs taken from patients who recovered and were discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to flu .
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently in use may have had an effect.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola was supposed to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually managed to take control.
There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infectious ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. (Fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high transmission rate through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which means that oral-fecal transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues, and even strangers in contact with patients or those infected.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; both surgical masks and N95 class respirators (Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent microdroplets of liquid from potentially infected from flying in the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only masks of class N95 (series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions ranging in size from 10 to 80 nm, they allow only 5% of virions to pass through; SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can even penetrate the five surgical masks stacked together, healthcare providers who come in direct contact with patients must wear N95 class masks (Series No. 1860s), not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear a fitted protective gown to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 class mask; perhaps the virus entered his body through sore eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles.
The entire population in affected or potentially threatened regions is strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant detergents more often than usual, try not to leave their home, observing self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
An acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be a distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high degree of its similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have been an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it acquired during SARS outbreak time in 2003.
However, only after January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured citizens by saying that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity from person to person transmission and that preventing the spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tensions, especially during the period when the whole country was preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
Chinese health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since every word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) more closely monitor and respond to unusual information coming from clinics, rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) to take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic in the early stages of its development, rather than reassure the public; and (4) to conduct targeted and effective exercises more often to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly check and improve the public response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, has spread to 50 countries.
Because the virus is very similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), SARS recurred during the outbreak of COVID-19.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than youth, and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
Mortality due to SARS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in an asymptomatic course of the disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, therefore it is more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
In some patients with COVID-19, conventional SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples may be negative.
On the other hand, cured patients may again show positive samples for the virus.
All this greatly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the backdrop of such rapid advances in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homolog between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection originated from bats.
Which animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, for example from bats, to humans?
Not knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission route, and the epidemiological situation may worsen at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus invade the cells of the respiratory tract and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does a virus genetically evolve during transmission from person to person?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it also disappear like SARS or will it recur periodically like flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to, no matter what the cost, stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal.
The COVID-19 vaccine is the 2019 hypothetical coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that not a single vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine to be received earlier than after 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates completed Stage I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread throughout the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research in this regard.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to provide the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technology platforms under development and research to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main goals of the platform included in Phase I safety studies:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, another 37 candidate vaccines were announced, but there is little publicly available information (presumably at the planning or development stage).
At stages I-II, preliminary testing for safety and immunogenicity is carried out, as a rule, randomized, placebo-controlled and in several areas with the simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically cover more participants, including a control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for effectiveness in terms of preventing the disease and at the same time side effects are monitored at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines that are under active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in preclinical trials).
On January 24, 2020, University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine to begin testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, pharmaceutical companies Janssen, led by Hanneke Suitemaker, announced the launch of their vaccine.
Janssen, together with its biotechnology partner Vaxart, is developing an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used for vaccination against neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the start of testing.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a candidate vaccine drug that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, located in western Maryland, announced they were developing their own vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of vaccines.
The partners also announced plans for preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were examining 11 isolated patients, and that even on an expedited basis, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, announced that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they created a particle similar to coronavirus.
A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government has protested against.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for mRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials, and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it will receive preclinical test results, and their final candidate drug for the vaccine can begin to be tested in humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Epidemic Preparedness Coalition (CEPI), France, announced a $ 4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine development consortium with the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University Pittsburgh. CEPI's total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is $ 29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in vaccine development from COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, and universities in Hong Kong, Oxford, and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different animal vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced the allocation of Canadian $ 275 million to finance 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate products at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of Canadian $ 192 million specifically for developing a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to create a national “vaccine bank,” which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus .
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that “MNA administered subunit vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, eliciting strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] which appeared 2 weeks after immunization. "
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian Waterloo University School of Pharmacy announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which could be available in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will multiply within human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three US universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers in conjunction with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other benefits besides the properties of disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines under development may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies evaluating vaccine efficacy using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, indicate the need for biosafety level 3 infection control measures when processing live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for humans to treat SARS.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS either.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the SARS study that was being conducted at that time could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) vaccine from MERS that passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on the viral vector and were in development, two were adenovirus ( ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one is MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Conspiracy theory was circulating on social media, claiming that the COVID-19 virus wasn’t new at all, and that a vaccine for it already existed.
Social media posts cited the words of some patients who claimed to have patents for the genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), decreasing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase domain of M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of renal amino acid colectrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I; its enzymatically active domain enters the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II alveolar lung cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.
The biosynthesis of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into a vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, cleaves the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into a vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup disease.
Being a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, the binding of the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike to the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme to endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the priming of protein S with the TMPRSS2 carrier serine protease, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to believe that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE and ARB inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published July 11, 2012, "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared with the control group."
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients with an overall risk of pneumonia. ”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novelty in therapy for acute lung injuries and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the exposure duration of 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising tool for people with intolerance to the classic inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. The rhACE2 administered was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019–2020 Is the current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an emergency of international importance in the field of public health was declared on January 30, 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and regions, which killed approximately 97,000 people.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The death rate in China is 4%, while in the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment has been found at this time.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining a distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people who suspect their infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, risk control at workplaces and the closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a widespread shortage of goods, exacerbated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
Disinformation about the virus began to spread on the Internet, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and Southeast Asia, or people resembling them in appearance, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of the spread of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have declined.
On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan City (the capital of Hubei Province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases of infection were mainly related to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood, so the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The outbreak virus is known as SARS-CoV-2. This is a recently discovered virus that closely resembles bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected did not visit the market after this date.
Two-thirds of infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, a publication in the South China branch of the Morning Post newspaper, the information of which was not verified, suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China has declined, but has unexpectedly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside of China has exceeded the number of new infections in China for the first time.
The number of cases of the onset of the disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular, due to the many cases with mild symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few infections were reported among young people, with patients who are 19 years old or younger make up less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. The chief scientific adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population will be infected before the formation of effective group immunity in the country's population.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test turned out to be positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, not a single country was able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, have adopted official policies requiring them not to be tested if they show only minor symptoms.
A study published on March 16 showed that 86% of cases of COVID-19 infection were not detected in China before January 23, and that such unregistered patients became a source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive infection number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
In a study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated that this figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 recover well.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of development of symptoms to the time of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years old, and 75% of those who died had comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official COVID-19 pandemic mortality data usually include deaths from patients with positive COVID testing performed according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, since official figures may not include dead people who have not been tested - for example, in the event of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official figures for COVID by 4–5 times.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that [the reported death toll] is below the actual." His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the United States. Such reporting with incomplete data is often found in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was recorded in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside of Asia in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and time of spread of the disease; they are also affected by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak, and population parameters such as age, gender and general health. The mortality / morbidity ratio is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed infections during a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
Data for different regions vary.
In China, the ratio of mortality to morbidity decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on January 1–10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of deaths due to illness (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the percentage of deaths from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the performance of certain population groups from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to estimates from the Oxford University Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The upper digit of this range is consistent with the results of the first random testing on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact flash duration are undetectable and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni, an employee of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to go up to the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease runs out, they begin to fade.
However, in the current situation it is practically impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will happen. ”
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, claims that “it could all be over by June,” if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations for stopping the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine announced that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate, possibly for a year or two."
According to a study conducted by Imperial College under the direction of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more),” physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, an employee of Vanderbilt University believes: “I don’t think that this coronavirus will ever disappear completely, because it is so easily transmitted”, and also that “it can turn into a seasonal disease, flaring up every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people can tolerate the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum in the airways (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, sore muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one in six people is seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immediate symptoms such as shortness of breath, constant pain or a feeling of flattening in the chest, a sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking up, and turning the face or lips blue. If you have these symptoms, you should immediately seek medical help. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
In some infected people, the disease can be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the test results confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that people who are in close contact with the confirmed diagnosis are closely monitored and examined for infection. .
According to estimates by Chinese scientists, the number of cases of the asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from a few units to 44% of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; usually it is five days. There is still no full clarity on the symptom of loss of smell: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom initially was 30%, and then fell to 15%.
Some details about the methods of spreading the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air along with coughing, sneezing or during a conversation; close contact refers to contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, with an open cough, drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that are released into the air during a conversation, which can remain in the air for a longer time. Respiratory drops can also form when you exhale, including during a conversation, although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air.
Drops can enter the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to nebulization of exhaled products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
There were cases when the tests turned out to be positive when tested three days before the onset of symptoms, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus before the manifestation of symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of an asymptomatic course of the disease, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also revealed cases of transmission of the disease from asymptomatic carriers.
Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on a cardboard surface for one day, and on copper surfaces for up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary with humidity and temperature. In domestic and other animals, a positive result was obtained on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing their hands after contact with animals, in the same way as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that infected people might touch.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group of acute respiratory infections registered in Wuhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found naturally in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with the help of household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is assumed that it has a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B), together with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the whole-genomic level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of the pangolin and human viruses.
A comprehensive-genomic comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) is between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Virus infection can be pre-diagnosed based on symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of infected secretions or computed tomography.
The results of a study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and the processes of the disease.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "Do not use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, and the first one was published on January 17.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) is being conducted.
It can be carried out on breathing tests and on blood samples.
Results are usually available over a period of several hours to several days.
Typically, a nasopharyngeal swab is used for the test, although a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them turned out to be accurate enough to receive approval for widespread use.
In the United States, the Cellex serology test was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features of symptom visualization on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) are asymmetric peripheral opacities like frosted glass and the absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is involved in compiling an international database of images of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to the similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, when identifying COVID-19, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
In China, a large study was conducted that compared the results of a chest CT scan and PCR testing, and it was found that although the images are less specific in case of infection, they can be decrypted faster; in addition, they are more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
For the diagnosis of the virus using x-ray and computed tomography, convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands, and using coughing or sneezing wipes that should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may have already become infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance oneself from people. Many governments recommend refraining from any non-urgent trips to countries and areas affected by the outbreak, and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among a population, some members of which do not know where and how they were infected. Healthcare professionals who care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when in contact with other people and eye protection. Contact tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
Governments using citizens' location data using their mobile phones for this purpose raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements demanding that this type of surveillance be restricted. by people.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and offered; As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on the development of solutions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data - for example, registering the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user was in close contact with the person whose test for COVID-19 was positive, he will receive a notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection - for example, rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to create it.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when your hands are very dirty, and before eating, after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which reveals its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60%.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (a disinfectant begins to act on a stainless steel surface a minute after application) containing 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0 2-7.5% of povidone iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution, such as an office or day care facility, all spaces of such premises, including cabinets, toilets, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls the controls and ATMs used by sick people were disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing, cover the mouth and nose with the back of your elbow or napkin and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, since using a mask can limit the volume and distribution range of expiratory products, which are dispersed in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "using a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, and touching their faces with dirty hands is the main way to get infected." Masks are also recommended for those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, people who care for a person with COVID-19, although she also recognizes that using a mask can actually reduce the number of touches on the face.
Several countries have begun to urge the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC Centers, USA, recommend wearing non-medical tissue masks. China separately emphasized the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials urge people to make facial fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are forbidden to go outside without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government obliged all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, in Taiwan, where since mid-March, ten million medical masks have been produced per day, it has been ordered that all passengers use trains and intercity buses to use medical masks.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going outside; those residents who can not purchase masks, it was recommended to sew them yourself at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an infection control measure designed to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping centers.
People can use social distance measures while staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distance themselves from others.
Many regional governments, especially those severely affected by the outbreak, currently prescribe or recommend social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can be gathered in one place according to the recommendations of the US government and health organizations was promptly reduced, starting from 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the distribution of COVID-19), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gathering in groups of more than two people. Older people and those suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory infections, hypertension, and a weakened immune system are at increased risk of getting the virus seriously. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if an outbreak occurs in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term “social distance” with “physical distance”, thus specifying the purpose of this measure is to reduce physical contacts within social networks, whether through virtual communication or maintaining physical distance .
The use of the term “social distance” was understood in such a way that people should expose themselves to complete social isolation, instead of remaining in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some departments have published sexual health guidelines that should be used during a pandemic.
Among others, recommendations were made to have sex only with your regular partners with whom you live, and in whom you are sure that he has no virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are recommended self-isolation at home.
Health facilities have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many governments have also introduced mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas quarantine themselves.
Persons in high-risk groups were prescribed strict quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with infected COVID-19, or who have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic, were recommended to be quarantined for 14 days from the last possible contact.
Outbreak control strategies include controlling, controlling, or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The containment of the spread of the disease is carried out in the early stages and aims to track and isolate the infected, and also implies other infection control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At the stage when the spread of the disease can no longer be controlled, efforts are aimed at mitigating the consequences: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease can be taken at the same time.
Suppressing the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the base number of infections to less than 1. Part of the effort to control an outbreak of an infectious disease is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of congestion in health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; social measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and canceling public events; involving the community in facilitating and participating in such measures; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning. After the seriousness of the outbreak became apparent in China, more decisive action was taken to contain the outbreak, such as isolating entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as organizing a warning system for movements of infected people.
In Singapore, they provided financial support to self-isolating infected individuals and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, increased production of medical masks and fined for the accumulation of excess supplies of medicines. Modeling in the UK and the USA has shown that there are serious problems regarding mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
An optimal mitigation policy can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used until the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if this happens earlier), because otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when measures are weakened .
Long-term intervention to suppress a pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There are currently no antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support.
Using steroid drugs can only do harm.
Several compounds that have been previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO has also reported that some “traditional and home remedies” can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO views capacity building and adapting healthcare to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the primary response to an outbreak.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to help reallocate resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing and eliminating urgent procedures whenever possible, virus detection and isolation of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as expanding the possibilities of intensive care through staff training and increasing the number of available ventilation machines and beds.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection could have arisen - the so-called “null patient”.
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Over the course of a month, the incidence of coronavirus infections in Hubei Province gradually increased.
They were mainly associated with the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of a massive pneumonia of unknown origin was recorded at a clinic in Hubei Province, with which doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, and on December 27, reported the case to the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Clinic warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ay Feng, received a reprimand from her superiors for raising a panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported a number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of an outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is the transport and main railway hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms of the disease. As of March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy in the largest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million infections were reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories recorded at least one registered case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay at home, compulsory shelter or isolation), and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people were isolated in the Philippines, about 59 million people were isolated in South Africa, and 1.3 billion man is in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people all over the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion people - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the accuracy of the information of which has not been verified, this date is November 17th.
On December 26, doctor Zhang Jixian worked with a massive case of pneumonia of an unknown type, and on December 27, her clinic notified the Jianhan Center for the Control and Prevention of Disease in Wuhan.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, revealed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
Initially, the China National Health Commission claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the ability of the newly detected virus to be transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later called the People’s Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping.
The events of “the largest quarantine in the history of mankind” began to unfold, on January 23, a sanitary cordon and a ban on entering Wuhan and vice versa were announced, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of personal vehicles was banned in the city.
In many places, Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled.
Authorities also announced the construction of the Huoshenshan Temporary Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital was built, Leixen Shan, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also reorganized 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including issuing health certificates to travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, authorities have introduced a remote mode of operation.
Travel restrictions were imposed in Hubei Province and beyond.
Public transportation schedules were changed, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, a regime for controlling the movement of citizens was introduced, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restriction of movement outdoors. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, in Beijing, a 14-day compulsory quarantine was introduced for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, in Mainland China there was only one case of domestic transmission of infection that occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of domestic transmitted cases was largely halted and the outbreak in China was controlled.
On the same day, restrictions on trips to Hubei, except for Wuhan, were lifted, this happened two months after the quarantine was closed. March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that from March 28, entry for people with a visa or residence permit will be suspended. The exact dates for the cancellation of this order were not called.
Those who wish to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on enterprises and factories to resume work and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On April 4, at 10:00 a national three-minute “minute of silence” took place, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, announced by the State Council of the country and coinciding with Quinmin, however, the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, observing physical distance to avoid repeated Flash COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of the disease, largely because Daegu gathered a large number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shinjongji.
Shinchongji's followers came to Daegu from Wuhan, which is thought to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, out of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease. On February 23, 2020, the highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were recorded in Korea, and on February 29, this figure increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after the analysis of the three soldiers confirmed the presence of the virus.
The outbreak affected the number of trips; therefore, the airline flight schedule was changed. South Korea has launched a population screening program for the virus, contact tracing and quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile application to everyone who came from abroad, on-site testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, as well as expanding testing capabilities that allowed testing up to 20,000 people daily.
The South Korean program is considered successful in combating the outbreak, despite the fact that whole cities have not been isolated there. Initially, South Korean society split due to the reaction of President Moon Jae In to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president’s actions or called for impeachment of Mr. Moon for the inadequate, in their opinion, government response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections per day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be placed in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, 121 countries turned to South Korea for help in testing for the virus.
On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, universities and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be quarantined.
In March, plans to limit intercity travel were announced, but intense travel between cities ahead of the Persian New Year continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of statements about concealing the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28, more than ten countries linked their illness to Iran, which indicates that the scale of the outbreak there may be more serious than 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government by this date.
Iran’s parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members, reported March 3, tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch (Human Rights Watch) called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as temporarily release all prisoners who fit this category.
The organization claims that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from this disease.
By March 23, in Iran, 50 new cases of coronavirus were registered every hour and every ten minutes - one new death from coronavirus.
According to a WHO spokesperson, the incidence rate in Iran could be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also expected that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial capabilities to protect against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded a relaxation of economic sanctions against countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome and tested positive.
The number of infections has grown rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 infections was later discovered. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “Entry into the outbreak area and exit from it will be blocked.
In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend the work of enterprises and cancel sporting events. ” On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, since in Italy at that time the death of 100 people had already been recorded.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9th, all sporting events were delayed for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of enterprises with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics guidelines for priority setting protocols for patients who might need to be involved.
March 19, Italy overtook China in terms of mortality from coronavirus, ranking first in the world, after the announcement of 3 405 deaths.
March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report notes that a combination of two factors can contribute to such a high mortality rate in Italy - a large number of elderly citizens of this country and the inability to examine everyone who is currently ill with coronavirus.
The United Kingdom reacted most calmly to this virus from all affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticized for not responding quickly enough and seriously to the danger that the country's population was in. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement in which he recommended refraining from all trips and social contacts that are not of paramount importance, suggesting that people work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment venues, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of their wages, but no more than £ 2,500 a month, as a measure to support the public crisis time. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced tougher measures for social distance, banning more than two people from gathering and restricting trips and outdoor activities to just emergency situations.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were introduced with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most enterprises were ordered to close, with the exception of enterprises that provide "livelihoods", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, in the Pacific Northwest State of Washington, a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15 confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in the country.
On January 29, the Coronavirus Task Force was established in the White House.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a state of emergency in the public health sector and imposed entry restrictions on visitors from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a leading US government organization for public health, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, population testing in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result, the true extent of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was difficult due to the rejection of test kits issued by the federal government in February, the absence by the end of February of the federal government’s permission to use non-state test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens undergo testing (this could be done only as prescribed by the attending physician).

For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, providing accuracy of as little as 30%, and the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: it was assumed that they were made in China, but subsequently it turned out that they came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency relief operations in developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to fight the epidemic and curb the spread of infection.
WHO noted clear differences between the situation of the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of classified information, which supposedly prevented the prevention of the disease and its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis when the central government "regularly provided updated information about the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year."
On January 23, in response to a decision by the central authorities to ban transport in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Goden Galea noted that although “this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO,” it is also “a very important confirmation of fulfilling the commitment to contain the epidemic in place most prevalent, ”and called it“ unprecedented in the history of public health. ” On January 30, after the ability of infection to be transmitted from person to person outside of China and the increase in the number of people infected in other countries was confirmed, WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC); this situation became the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first applied during the swine flu pandemic.
The WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adan, said the PHEIC announcement was “a risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily impede international movements and trade”, and that “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On February 5, WHO asked the world community for $ 675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for emergency assistance to countries that “do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite that the epidemic has not yet reached these countries. ”
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our preparedness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link,” and called on the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future.” At a press conference held on February 11, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem.”
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group was created to coordinate all the United Nations response; these steps, according to WHO, will “focus on the response in the health field, while other agencies can use their expertise to deal with the outbreak more broadly socially and economically.”
On February 14, WHO and China initiated the creation of a joint ad hoc group, which supported the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to help resolve the situation within the country and assess the “seriousness of the disease and its infectiousness”, and organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On February 25, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that“ it’s too early to call this disease a pandemic, but countries should nevertheless be prepared for this. ”
When an outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team there to assess the situation. February 28, WHO officials said that the likelihood of global spread of coronavirus will be increased from "high" to "very high" - the highest degree of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, warned in a statement: “This is a test of every government on the planet to be prepared for the reality: it's time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared, ”and also emphasized that the right response can help the world avoid the“ worst case scenario. ”
Ryan also said that current data did not warrant the announcement of a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that a pandemic would mean that “we essentially recognize that everyone on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus.” ".
March 11, WHO announced the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.
The WHO Director-General stated that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease, and the equally disturbing level of inaction in relation to this problem.” WHO has been heavily criticized for its inadequate approach to the concept of a pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the current situation, a petition was submitted to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, with a proposal to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized the importance of respecting each person’s rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to take life saving measures against him, and the government is responsible for organizing such measures.
The group emphasized that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way be an excuse for discrimination against a specific group of people.
Experts emphasized that everyone has the right to protection of health, including people with disabilities, representatives of minority groups, senior citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless people, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need in state support.
International government organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the crisis associated with COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has created a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to share opinions and provide recommendations.
The digital site contains information on country policies (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, eliminate the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the fight against coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, cabinet secretary Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaru, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaru, for their efforts to combat the pandemic that began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at the provincial level were fired for the quarantine measures they took in central China, and these dismissals indicated dissatisfaction with the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of coronavirus began in Wuhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
US Presidential Administration Donald Trump called the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” saying that “censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus, which has now become a global pandemic,” and this statement was criticized by some commentators. who claim that this approach is racist and "distracts from the inability of the US presidential administration to curb the spread of the disease."
The Daily Beast gained access to the US government telegram, which contains a strategic communications trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council; at the same time, there are such mentions of the strategy: “It's all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. ” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg said China’s efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of the “propaganda push” to gain global influence.
Josep Borrell, head of the EU foreign affairs agency, warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through PR and the so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively promoting the idea of ​​its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States."
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to some reports, sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned due to U.S. sanctions on April 3.
US authorities are also accused of redirecting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
There have also been disputes regarding medical masks between other countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of ventilators intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for coronavirus-affected Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said that “only China has responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not indicate European solidarity. ”
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian military orderlies, specialized disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to be sent to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cites an anonymous “high-level political source,” claiming that 80% of Russian aid was “worthless or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of striving to make a favorable impression on the world community at the "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a medical cargo plane to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production, they will also be able to provide reciprocal assistance if necessary."
NATO Defender 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states — NATO’s largest military exercises since the end of the Cold War — will be conducted in an abbreviated format.
Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized Defender 2020 exercises (Defender 2020): "In the crisis situation that has developed today in the field of public health, the conduct of these exercises threatens the lives of not only the US military and many European participating countries, but also the inhabitants of countries where such events should be held. ” The Iranian government has been hit hard by the virus. About two dozen MPs, as well as fifteen other current or former politicians, have been infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an open letter asked world leaders for help, saying that his country was having difficulty fighting the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has generated calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other affluent countries, including the introduction of a unified health and childcare system, paid family leave, and increased funding for public health.
Political analysts expected this could negatively impact Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. The pandemic has worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan’s “controversial and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in government-designated places.
South Korean society was initially divided due to the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president’s actions or called for impeachment of Mr. Moon for the inadequate, in their opinion, government response to the outbreak. The pandemic has forced countries to enact emergency laws in response.
Some commentators are concerned that this move will allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orban an unlimited right to rule by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those who would be accused of disseminating fake information about the virus and government measures to deal with the crisis.
The outbreak of coronavirus was called the cause of several cases of supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in a panic and disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings of a shortage of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Panic purchases also occurred in several locations; this led to a situation where essential goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, disappeared from store shelves, which, in turn, led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has grown 100 times.
This jump led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the regular price, as well as to delays in the supply of medical devices for four to six months.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that health workers would be under attack for that reason.
In Australia, in connection with the pandemic, Daigou buyers have a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as high food demand, acute food shortages were avoided in both areas.
Successful measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and the illicit trade in critical products have avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, did not experience significant recessions, but, according to industry representatives, agricultural prices could rise.
Shelves of food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to provide adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve food stocks in case of emergency exist in Italy.
The damage to the global economy affected China: according to media reports on March 16, the Chinese economy suffered severely in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to control the spread of the virus, which resulted in a decrease in retail sales by 20, five%.
Mainland China is a major economic and industrial center; therefore, a viral outbreak is considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
According to forecasts by Agate Demaray, an employee of the Economist Intelligence Unit, market volatility will continue until a clearer picture of potential results appears.
In January 2020, some analysts calculated that the economic consequences of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could outperform the effects of the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004.
According to one estimate made by an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain can exceed $ 300 billion, and the negative impact can last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to take "urgent measures" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19, outside of mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, various US stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, showed the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1191 points - The largest one-day drop after the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10 percent drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus, with the biggest drop on March 16th.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendation of governments not to take any trips.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines canceled flights due to a sharp decrease in demand for airline tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry was stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments canceled a number of events involving a large number of people, including annual New Year festivals; private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's events were canceled, and tourist attractions were closed in order to prevent mass crowds; for example, the Forbidden City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs were canceled.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, authorities extended the New Year holidays until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open before this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities raised their response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling New Years celebrations. The retail sector has been hit globally: store hours have been shortened and some stores have been temporarily closed.
Retail sales in Europe and Latin America were down 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50–60%.
As a result, in March, attendance at shopping centers fell by 33–43% compared with February.
Operators of shopping centers around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving sanitation, installing equipment to check the temperature of visitors, and canceling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by a pandemic could leave 14-22 million more people beyond poverty than it would be in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers ended up at home in their provinces or locked up in Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the government for help.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, an outbreak of coronavirus could lose 47 million jobs and unemployment could reach 32%. Self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers on a daily basis unemployed. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households had some form of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have transferred their employees to a government-subsidized shortened work schedule - part-time.
The German part-time pay scheme has also been introduced in France and the UK.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected organizations and individuals, whether formally employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and art organizations have tried to support their mission (often funded by the state) to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, as well as supporting artists, if possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed for an indefinite period around the world, or access to them was to some extent limited, and exhibitions, events and performances were canceled or rescheduled.
In return, vigorous efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The movie industry also crashed. The Vatican has announced the cancellation of Holy Week events in Rome, which are held in the last week of the Christian penitential period - Lent.
Many dioceses recommend older Christians to stay home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services began to be broadcast on the radio, live, or on television, while leaders of some churches propose holding outdoor services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed to visit its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled services and limited access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of coronavirus, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia has banned the access of foreign pilgrims and their own residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been canceled or rescheduled, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; On March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "rescheduled for the period after 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either rescheduled or canceled.
This has led many players to go online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also canceled all of their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians began to explore options to continue their activities and share their results on the Internet, organize live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; it helps people in creative professions to continue to perform, release or publish their works.
A lot of Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have appeared on the network, many of which are humorous and smooth out the alarming moods characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an exacerbation of bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as to representatives of the population of hot spots in Europe, the USA and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February news reports (when most cases of infection were still limited to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved this virus or received fair retribution for something.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese sentiment is also rising.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Citizens of China, as well as those living in areas affected by the virus, were provided with support both offline and online.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular, in Italy - the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea signed a petition early on, insisting that Chinese citizens not enter their countries to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDon't ComeInJapan) has been a leader on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist sentiment and even assault.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus “the Chinese virus”; critics consider this opinion racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanzhary.
Students coming from north-eastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India have reported harassment cases associated with an outbreak of coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, said the Chinese destroyed nature and "therefore God avenged them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, calling them “delusion.” In China, because of the pandemic, xenophobia and racism broke out again in relation to non-Chinese residents: they began to call foreigners “foreign garbage” and objects to be “disposed of."
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have publicly published their scientific articles on the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some scholars have decided to give short-term access to their research results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Repositioning a drug (also known as reassigning, reassigning, changing tasks, or reassigning drugs) is the reassignment of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition other than the disease originally prescribed.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides an appropriate basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP-ribophosphatase.

Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences researchers found that remdesivir has in vitro antiviral activity against a variety of filo, pneumo, paramyx, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two being conducted by Cleveland University Clinics; one is carried out on patients with a moderate form of the disease, and the other on patients with a more severe form of the disease.
Three clinical trials are currently underway for intravenous administration of vitamin C for people hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without a placebo (Italy).

Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 implies the use of occupational safety and health methods to control risk and control the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk control at the workplace depends on the place and work task, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic situation in the community and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable due to COVID-19.
The US Office of Occupational Safety and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that lower-risk positions have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are needed to fight the infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home with signs diseases, compliance with respiratory etiquette, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to become infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international trips.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, for example, in schools, in high-density work environments, and in some large retail stores.
In addition to basic measures for the prevention of infection, risk control measures for this group include ventilation using high-performance air filters, the use of protective shields and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that healthcare providers and morgues who come in contact with someone with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection with COVID-19 are at high risk; however, the degree of risk increases to a very high level when such employees conduct procedures involving the formation of an aerosol, or collect / process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such employees include the use of engineering safety equipment, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 flash can have various effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for other people, or due to fear of possible infection.
Commercial templates can change both in terms of the types of goods for which there is a demand, and how to purchase such goods (for example, making purchases during off-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be interruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographic regions affected by COVID-19. When organizing protection, you can use the Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan.
The plans address issues about risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors that arise at home and in communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or the presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the controls necessary to solve the problems with such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the goals for responding to the epidemic are: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure that is widely used in ensuring occupational safety and health for grouping such tools depending on their effectiveness.
If it is impossible to eliminate the risk of disease, COVID-19 is most effective engineering and technical safety measures, then - administrative measures and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering security measures involve isolating employees from risk areas associated with work and do not rely on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action from an employee or employee.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help address some of the risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected depending on the threat to the employee, appropriate in size (for example, respirators), used constantly and properly, regularly checked, maintained in good condition and replaced as necessary, as well as removed, cleaned and stored correctly. or disposed of to avoid infection.
The US Office of Occupational Safety and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to control the epidemic, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, respiratory etiquette, including closing the mouth with your hand when coughing and sneezing, providing wipes and garbage containers, and readiness for remote or shift work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Quickly identifying and isolating individuals who could potentially be infected is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory infections stay at home until the fever stops, they have no fever and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or other medications that relieve the symptoms. and also prescribes the flexibility of sick leave policies, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and ensure that employees are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspected infection with COVID-19, but there is a chance of infection with SARS-CoV- 2 due to the spread of the disease in society in the territory where the business is located, or in connection with recent trips of such a person to the places of distribution of COVID-19.
Such categories include workers who have had contact with the public, for example, in schools, a high-density work environment, and some large retail stores. Safety engineering tools for such and higher-risk groups include installing high-performance air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields, and installing windows for customer service without leaving the vehicle. Administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups include advising sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual means of communication, setting shift schedules, stopping non-critical trips to COVID-19 distribution sites, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum to answer questions that concern workers, providing relevant training for employees on risk factors COVID-19 and protective measures, training workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, the proper use of such products, providing resources and a working environment conducive to personal hygiene, the requirement for regular hand washing, restricting access to the workplace by customers and the public, placing information signs on the need for hand washing and other protective measures against COVID-19. Depending on work tasks, workers with a risk level of at least average may need to wear personal protective equipment, including in combinations that include gloves, a dressing gown, a screen or face mask, or safety glasses.
In rare cases, workers from this risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, then to ensure proper safety for workers and other passengers, measures are required such as isolating a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for a sick person, providing the patient with a mask or contacting such a person with a request to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing.
Minor crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or in contact with body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, regular cough, or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and infected surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, safety measures include delaying the trip in case of illness, self-isolation and immediate informing the medical center on the ship in the presence of heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in the isolation cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or medium infection spread in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, for example, canceling trips for personal meetings, meetings and other public events, such as physical education or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, and adjusting time of arrival and departure, restriction of non-essential visits, use of the separate location of health facilities for children with flu-like symptoms.
At a significant pace of distribution in the local community, in addition to strategies for social distance, measures can be considered for prolonged non-attendance at school. For law enforcement officials with daily responsibilities, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection with COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as prescribed by ambulance paramedics, including the use of suitable personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the detention, workers should clean and disinfect their uniform belts and equipment before reuse with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as for use and washing clothes.
OSHA believes that certain categories of healthcare workers and morgues are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical personnel who come in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when they carry out procedures involving the formation of an aerosol, or when collecting / processing samples from people with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection with COVID-19.
Procedures involving aerosol formation include probing, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue workers include those who process the bodies of people with confirmed illness or suspected infection with COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such employees perform an autopsy, they will be transferred to the very high risk category. Additional engineering and technical safety measures for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed illness or suspected COVID-19, including during procedures involving the formation of an aerosol.
In some healthcare facilities and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
Samples should be handled with the precautionary measures prescribed for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be allocated to delimited waiting areas based on suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting up to 6 feet away with patients with confirmed illness or suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as those who carry out procedures involving aerosol formation.
In the U.S., NIOSH-approved face masks with an N95 or higher filter must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that identifies personalized screening requirements and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing, as COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by the respiratory tract rather than through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends using only surgical masks for screening staff at the patient reception site.
For individuals collecting airway samples from patients with COVID-19 or carriers of the disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, safety glasses or a face shield, bathrobe and gloves.
When carrying out procedures accompanied by the formation of an aerosol, a N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the inadequate availability of personal protective equipment around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment by using the capabilities of distance medicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, and only those who provide access to a patient infected with COVID-19 direct care, the use of only personal protective equipment that is necessary for a specific task, the continued use of the same respirator without removing, when working with several patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and coordination of the personal protective equipment supply chain and recommendations not to use masks for individuals without symptoms.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the millionth line of infections worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
The coronavirus COVID-19 killed at least 52 thousand people.
The milestone came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and the first death of a coronavirus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries in which no cases of coronavirus infection were recorded.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of coronavirus infection were recorded, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1000 deaths due to coronavirus infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the regime of self-isolation of citizens until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; The results of voting: 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas previously the curfew lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
The Ohio Governor, Mike DeWyne, announced that the state’s home isolation regime was extended by order until May 1.
Coronavirus is a disease diagnosed in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases boil down to the manifestation of mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million infections were recorded in 210 countries and regions, more than 153,000 people died from this disease.
More than 568,000 people recovered. The virus mainly spreads when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic droplets released into the air when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets form when you exhale, they usually pose a risk of contact with the ground or surface, but are not transmitted through the air at long distances.
People also become infected by touching a contaminated surface, and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected illness, as well as for those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population vary: some departments recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, while others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected individuals may not have symptoms or have flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, or turning the face or lips blue; if the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat, are less common.
Also, gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in different percentages.
Some cases registered in China were initially manifested only by a sensation of constriction in the chest and a rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and eventually death occurs.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days after infection. According to available data, symptoms are not manifested in all infected.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is still completely unknown, but preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with an asymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; however, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospital admissions for the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily report from April 1; out of 166 cases of infection recorded on this day, 130 (78%) refused asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
With loud speech, more drops are released into the air than with normal volume speech.
A study in Singapore showed that drops can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) with an open cough.
The virus, as a rule, is not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences suggested that the transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol route is still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms showed the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to nebulization of exhaled products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus might spread through feces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before the onset of symptoms, but this risk is low.
Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a cardboard surface the virus is able to live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These figures, however, vary with humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used correctly, have a rather useful effect in terms of combating infection: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and is also able to remove it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest virus content in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe Acute Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome, first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally-related coronaviruses.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which reveals its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II lung alveolar cells.
The virus binds to ACE2 and enters the host cell with the help of a characteristic surface glycoprotein - a spike (peplomer).
In 12% of infected people admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, they diagnosed acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe cases of the disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities, because they are involved in the work of this organ.
A high frequency of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in ICUs with COVID-19, and may indicate poor prognosis. An autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
An autopsy also revealed lymphocytic infiltrates.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard testing method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab, but a swab sample from the nose or sputum can also be used.
Results are usually available within a period of several hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world could independently develop tests using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of this virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests for antibodies that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of a possible infection in the past, were under development, but have not yet become widespread.
The Chinese experience in studying the results of these tests showed that their accuracy is only 60–70%.
On March 21, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing it to be used later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University indicate methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multi-lobed subpleural foci of compaction according to the type of “frosted glass” with peripheral, asymmetric and a posteriori distribution are common symptoms that are detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of a cobblestone bridge (lobular thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of a pathological examination performed at autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene practices, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a tissue, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a good hand hygiene procedure be performed.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using face masks in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection to people with an asymptomatic course of the disease. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and enterprises were closed, limited movement of citizens, and major public events were canceled.
Distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19. Since the completion of the vaccine development is expected no earlier than 2021, the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "going to the plateau."
The CDC also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when your hands are very dirty, and before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant (alcohol content of at least 60%) for the treatment of hands, but only in cases where soap and water are not available. In regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
Ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity is used in these formulations.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic treatment of hands.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Supportive therapy is indicated for patients, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle, and diet are recommended.
Supportive therapies may be indicated for patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published guidelines for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the USA, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in the free resource - IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some healthcare providers recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) compared to ibuprofen.
When performing procedures during which airborne droplets may occur, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical settings.
CDC recommends that caregivers care for people with COVID-19 in an air-drip isolator (AIIR) - an additional measure beyond standard contact and air safety precautions. The CDC has published recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective gown, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the EUA.
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used not in accordance with the instructions, effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using face shields or, in extreme cases, making masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the COVID-19 flow pattern is not heavy enough to require mechanical ventilation or its alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases when this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory distress associated with COVID-19 is currently being studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by using a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or a two-level positive airway pressure ways.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods is as effective for critically ill patients as mechanical ventilation.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to a nasal cannula with intense airflow. The risk of a severe form of the disease for older people (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita, and health system resources are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in severe cases of COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization.
According to the results of one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for lung function with ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of providing mechanical ventilation is becoming more complicated as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that develops with COVID-19 and oxygenation are causing more and more problems.
Ventilation with support for inspiratory pressure and PEEP are necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to minimize their damage by ventilation, which can result in pneumothorax.
On earlier fan models, high PDK may not be available.
Studies of potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
The most promising is remdesivir.
New drug development may last until 2021, but some of the tested drugs have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO recommended volunteers take part in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to use convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment when a person is in serious or immediate danger.
Its use has not been subjected to clinical studies that must be conducted to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat an outbreak.
To enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
An application can detect “close contact” using surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, face recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence - these tools are used to track infected people and people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave permission to security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people who are suspected to be infected with a coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided federal state institutions in Germany and the Robert Koch Institute aggregated data on the location of mobile subscribers.
In Russia, face recognition technology was introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Italian Regional Health Ombudsman Giulio Gallera said mobile network operators said that "40% of people still continue to move around the territory."
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or because of fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor: “Increased social exclusion, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and an economic downturn are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being.”
The disease can be mild with minor or absent symptoms resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold.
Patients with a mild form of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while treatment of patients with severe or critical forms may take from three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available. In some people, COVID-19 can infect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In individuals with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.
Anomalies in thrombus formation, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while impaired renal function was observed in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to studies of cases of the disease at an early stage, the average time from the onset of initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, and among women - 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
In pneumocytes, viral cytopathic changes were observed.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems included elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality by state vary due to such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Ineffectively mild case counts can lead to overstatement of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths result from diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
In smokers, severe symptoms of COVID-19 developed in general 1.4 times more often, and such patients were approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were expressed about the consequences of the disease in the long run.
The administration of one of the clinics in Hong Kong found that in some patients who recovered from this disease, the lung volume was reduced by 20-30%, and their scan revealed damage.
After recovery, this can also lead to the syndrome "After intensive care."
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who have recovered from the virus develop stable immunity against it.
Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered probable, but there have also been reports of cases where, after recovering from COVID-19, coronavirus tests still turned out to be positive.
It is believed that in these cases there was an aggravated prolonged course of the disease, and not re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from person to person.
The study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date of the first case of the disease.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and the time of the spread of the disease, they are also affected by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimen used, the time from the outbreak, and population parameters such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the disease ICD-10 emergency codes: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation SARS-CoV-2 infections. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a period of time.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure varies by region. Some other methods include determining the mortality rate due to illness (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as determining the mortality rate due to infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who have died as a result of a disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the performance of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have had an infection, the presence of such antibodies shows how many people were infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebration among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, Germany's healthcare system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by the indicators of donated blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
Pandemic effects and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over the age of 50; the gap in indicators between men and women is narrowing only from the age of 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, a lower prevalence of smoking among women, and concomitant diseases in men (for example, hypertension manifested in men at a younger age than women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infections were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were in men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not maintain gender statistics for COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS, have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nursing staff, are women, respectively, they are more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name for this disease - COVID-19.
The WHO Director, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, explains: “CO” means “crown”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease”, and 19 is the year the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (for example, China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO additionally uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus”.
Both the disease and the virus itself are usually called the “coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the “coronavirus” and the “Wuhan coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations for the use of geographical locations in names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published.
Due to limitations in standard supply chain sizes, some digital service providers are printing medical supplies, such as swabs for nasal swabs, as well as parts for ventilators.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, then one of the local manufactures was reprofiled and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread rapidly on the Internet.
It is likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
The research results did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs to treat it.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial (“Solidarity Test”) program, which aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of four existing compounds that are considered the most effective today.
There is no ready-made vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing candidate vaccine preparations.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate into human cells using the ACE2 receptor, therefore, scientific research uses the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at provoking a quick immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at breaking down the S-shaped protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating a vaccine).
Pilot vaccines developed using any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, Seattle began the first clinical trial of a vaccine in four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-enhancing has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of these studies were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reprofiling of antiviral drugs is a large part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine studies of phase III on remdesivir were conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted. For the same purpose, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also considered, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, as well as lopinavir / ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the USA, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but at the same time notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued authorization for emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also indicate interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir as anti-COVID-19 agents.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for a detailed in vivo study, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that for penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, priming of the thorn protein with the serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is necessary.
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without a more detailed study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinemia properties. As a result of a small study by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug went to stage 2 of a non-randomized test, which is carried out at the national level in Italy, after positive results were obtained for its use in patients with a severe form of the disease.
In combination with a ferritin blood serum test to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transmission of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is currently considered a non-vaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy has been tested in treating patients with SARS, but its results have been inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and / or phagocytosis, can also be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of convalescent blood serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against this virus, may be increased.

Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages available at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian Woolworths and Coles chain stores reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a single package limit.
These restrictions were reported in box office ads, as well as on the Facebook page of the network.
It is reported that citizens began to make emergency supplies because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles already limited this amount to 4 packs.
The Coles distribution network, in a March 8 press release, said that with the introduction of a four-pack limit, “in many stores, toilet paper is still being sold out too quickly — one delivery in an hour,” and called such demand “unprecedented” at the time as ALDI in a Facebook post on Tuesday called this trend “unexpected.”
According to the representative of Woolworths, last week there was a sharp increase in sales.
Costco's Canberra store last week also limited that amount to two packs.
To make up for the shortage, Coles began to order larger lots from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional lots, while ALDI stockpiled for a special early sale stock on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said retailers are trying to replenish supplies, but this is hampered by local government restrictions on truck schedules.
He expects an increase in the cost of production, as suppliers try to satisfy demand, but at the same time less and less profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to depletion of stocks, some stores are unable to hold stocks on Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish stores every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky product, so the number of stocks is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, the long rows of shelves remain empty, reinforcing the feeling of running out of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and items such as toilet rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed in large quantities on these shelves, buyers probably would not panic like that.” Says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, recycled toilet maker Who Gives a Crap announced the end of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex toilet paper manufacturer and Solaris Paper, which also manufactures Sorbent brand products, said they work around the clock to ensure there are enough products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to a lack of buyers during Labor Day week, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday edition of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 ABC Australia report, at first stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, saying they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, haberdashery, hand washing products and flour.
Similarly, besides the events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the online supermarket of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.

TOPIC: [Covid-19] Relieving stress and preparing for the future
DATE / TIME OF DELIVERY: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
PERMISSIONS: CC0: No Protected Rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that shed light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to empathize, collaborate and develop communities around the world that underlies such an organization.
We observed comradely and caring relationships between all our colleagues, which was reflected in electronic correspondence, calls and chats - a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.
I am very grateful and proud to talk about you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed of a high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether to ensure the operation of sites, payment by our colleagues or to protect the safety of communities.
The world needs the information presented on Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At such a time, in order to achieve significant results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but how we do it.
Due to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes to the order of our joint work, starting from the coming week.
Adjustment of the order of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team came together last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the course of communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve stress and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, then so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
according to our expectations, it will be necessary to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are received.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now; Whatever your needs, be it to take care of your relatives, purchase food products, or go to see a doctor, your well-being is our number one priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
This is understandable and indisputable, but we mention it.
No sick leave or day off is required: just inform your supervisor and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, notify T&C Ops of Brian so that T&C can provide support and proper attention from management to your situation).
Hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirm our intention to comply with obligations to our contractors and employees with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid according to the usual hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially at such times.
And again we are talking about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some jobs are considered significant.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to providing support, which is crucial for our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “twice as much to catch up” after the pandemic.
You do not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We acknowledge that circumstances have changed and will work on setting new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations in terms of daily working time, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to offer an extension of the terms for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow employees to give priority to critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones, and at the same time to everyone who needs or wants to work, An abbreviated schedule for the next few weeks will be provided.
This extension of time can significantly reduce the current planning burden and tension throughout the organization.
Next week we will present our proposal to the Council, we will inform representatives and teams of relevant information on the next steps immediately after receiving the appropriate confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this work.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many safety precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to sanitize all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules that require caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located on WeWork’s network, which has shared its DCV-19 related rules with us and all DC staff.
Last week, our office in the District of Columbia completely switched to telecommuting as directed by San Francisco.
As some of our New York colleagues know, we also discussed renting a room in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one to two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider splitting them into a course of several days.
Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and send out materials for familiarization in advance.
Use video communication by default, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator - a person who will monitor the flow of questions in the chat and control the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for taking notes (or joint notes).
If you need to use a convenient headset, contact technical support by e-mail.
Take advantage of your Wellness Reimbursement program for snacks.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk with colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is exploring ergonomic guides available in webinar format to help facilitate distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-sponsored public events, such as “editathons,” until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to conduct agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for delays or changes in such goals.
Next week we will hold follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general mood in the global community is not only a sadness due to interruption of work, but also a certain sense of relief due to mutual understanding and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
In terms of perspectives, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that provides a community space to keep track of impact and communication.
We keep in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC / 07: 00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to additionally share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting to each other.
We are together in such a situation and are ready to help everyone we can.
However, you can still receive information from such electronic correspondence, and other important information on COVID-19 from the Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about trips, events, a key workflow, problems with reporting, or if you need other help, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and provide communication as necessary.
For privacy issues, email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such changes should be construed as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
Quite the contrary: this is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and obligations.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and provide the opportunity to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the whole world with the help of the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate times.
Today it is time to support each other and create space for important work coming in the coming weeks and, possibly, months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with maximum efficiency as soon as such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V , Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Diagnostic criteria needed to be updated for “cases of suspected disease” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our group published a short reference guide for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information about our experience and provides verified recommendations for combating this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been increasing gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “cases of suspected illness” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Diagnostic and Treatment Recommendations for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National PRC Health Committee.
In December 2019, an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) occurred, now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a quick reference guide and published it online on the website of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted enormous attention.
It should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, therefore, our understanding and knowledge increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, in the period from January 16 to March 3, 2020, seven issues of the document “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19,” published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and the content of some of its provisions has changed significantly.
Recently, a paper by Zhou et al. Commented on our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on this pandemic that spanned the whole world.
We confirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of “Diagnostic and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19” (trial seventh version) and based on the results of ongoing research, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (March 3, 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming a case of suspected illness, it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of movement or location in Wuhan and its environs or in other localities where cases of COVID-19 were recorded within 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs, or from other places where cases of COVID-19 were recorded during the last 14 days before the symptoms appeared; (4) a history of contact with groups of people with confirmed illnesses (≥ 2 cases characterized by high fever or respiratory symptoms recorded within 2 weeks in small areas, such as a house or apartment, office, classroom at school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total white blood cell count is normal or decreased with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of disease should be based on a case of suspected disease with one of the following items of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) genome-wide sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity relative to the new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in the test result from negative to positive for the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody, or a titer increase of at least 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues of this document, a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of a blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) issues; and then in the seventh issue the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the results of continuous work by researchers searching for the optimal kit for detecting nucleic acids during quick diagnosis, as well as for analyzing samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.
However, there is increasing evidence regarding the need for caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without severe symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented by Zhou et al. Needs to be updated, since people with no clinical symptoms are classified as a “low risk” group.
The rating system also needs to be clarified during further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we note that we hope to receive more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
Regarding the diagnosis of “cases of suspected illness” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly follow the latest recommendations that are given in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 - daily high
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day yesterday.
This is the largest number of virus deaths per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Disease Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home, were reported as infections.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two who died were over the age of 60, two at the age of 51 to 60, and one at the age of 41-50.
She also reported that the two dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic official told the local Anadol news agency that one of the victims was Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Maitri Kuwait clinic.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Kwader, said public transport would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped from March 26 and was supposed to resume on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of basic necessities - medicines, fuel and food - was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 from two people who returned from Italy, as well as from the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have already recovered.
World Health Organization announces COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease, and not the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that national governments need to take measures:
“All countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are involved in identifying, testing, treating, isolating the diseased, tracking the occurrence of the disease, and mobilizing their citizens, ”explained WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease, and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus except influenza has been monitored from its inception to continuous global spread."
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.
We have also never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled. ”
First, in January, WHO declared an outbreak of the disease an emergency in public health of international concern, and then assigned it a new status - a pandemic.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, spoke of the outbreak: "This is only the beginning, it will get worse."
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported on Thursday in the world, more than 4,600 people died.
Laboratory testing of the 2019 Respiratory Coronavirus (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which recognizes coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is intended only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too slight to go to the hospital or were completely absent.
The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.
By March 23, no country was able to verify more than 3% of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries is very contradictory.
It is likely that such differences in information significantly affect recorded mortality rates, which in some countries can be significantly exaggerated.
Using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on airway samples obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab or a sputum sample.
Results are usually available over a period of several hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR test performed on swabs taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of illness.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, continuing, however, to multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, alternatively, material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken using a suction catheter, or expectoration products (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO) .
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its own test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on clinical grade PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the E gene, common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific for SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive approval from the National Drug Administration of China for the emergency use of a PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing through its International Reagent Resource its diagnostic panel for real-time RT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in laboratories public health.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and the narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, during the whole of February 2020, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after this date were state and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency permit for use. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for infection with COVID-19 based on RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were announced; sampling and processing of assays should be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology "VECTOR".
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. It was reported that on May 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of a test that can be run for 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, which allows one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application authorization (EUA) to Abbott laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the FDA's EUA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can detect positive results in just five minutes, and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a monoclonal antibody test is being developed that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, and it is hoped that results can be obtained in 15-20 minutes, similar to the rapid flu test.
A review of specialized literature for March 2020 concludes that "chest radiographs have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results may be of such value even before symptoms appear."
Typical signs revealed during CT include bilateral multi-lobed subpleural focal points of the “frosted glass” type with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, cobblestone pavement symptom and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the onset of the current pandemic showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "Do not use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19." As of March 2020, CDC recommends using the PCR method for initial screening.
A partial immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of the presence of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct population control. Assays can be done at central laboratories (CLT) or through on-site diagnostics (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT typically uses a single peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncture of the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, a blood sampling step for taking an assay is not required. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency approval test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for the use of their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies with the ability to fight the virus in blood samples.
Testing performance is several hundreds of samples over several hours and, therefore, this method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody assay kits it acquired yielded satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed that allows patients with a suspected virus to stay home: “emergency department employees give the patient a test tube for the sample,” the patient spits on it, gives it back, and after a while receives the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot home suspect case testing scheme, which eliminates the risk of patient exposure to other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. In the course of rapid testing for COVID-19 in case of suspicious cases, a medical professional takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
Rapid testing centers have helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. On March 2, in Germany, the National Association of Mandatory Medical Insurance Doctors announced that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day on an outpatient basis, and a week earlier they could only do 10,700 tests per week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, then the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the president of the Institute, Robert Koch, Germany’s total testing capacity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct rapid testing in several large cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests passed in Germany was unknown, since only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of calendar week 12/2020, no less than 483,295 analyzes were taken on SARS-CoV-2, up to week 12/2020, inclusive, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) ) the result was positive. Researchers at Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital clinics have developed and tested a method for simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analyzes only if the combined sample shows a positive result. In Wuhan on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory with an area of ​​2000 square meters. emergency detection meter called “Huo-Yan” (Chinese 火 眼 or “Fiery Eye”), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jiang and completed in just 5 days; modeling showed that if this laboratory had not been commissioned at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would be 47% more, and accordingly, the cost of quarantine would also be twice as high.
After opening the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai - in total, in 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, daily throughput totals were 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays open multiplex circuits have been released that can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic fluid manipulators.
By March, due to the shortage and insufficient amount of reagents, it became problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, the UK and the USA.
As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols that require heating samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing currently being conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita is higher than any other country, and soon most of the population will be tested.
This was due to the ability to conduct rapid testing, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (established on the basis of their laboratories for the detection of emergency cases in China, Huo-Yan).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world of such a large scale operating outside of China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the production of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; The protocol, developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centers, was not available until January 28, resulting in a lack of test kits in the United States. At the very beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States there were problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were not able to provide a sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
But in South Korea, experts say, the widespread availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many private laboratories in the United States, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overloaded, and supplies of swabs and chemicals were quickly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
CDC's US test kits had “flaws”, and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private test development. Spain purchased test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd in China, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the result of inaccurate results could be poor sampling or misuse of kits.
The Spanish ministry said it will withdraw kits that give inaccurate results and replace them with other kits - Shenzhen Bioeasy kits. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic acquired in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovich suggested dumping them in the Danube. Atesh Qara, a spokesman for the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that test kits purchased in China had a "high error rate" and the Ministry "did not use them." The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 it was declared unsuitable for use.
Quarantine measures for individuals whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring the people contacted by such patients, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where for the first time in Italy a person died from COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing the entire population of about 3400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half the people with a positive result had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
Entrance to the territory of the village was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of infection.
With intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less intense than in other developed countries, and there were no need to introduce extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many events there were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on March 23 opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also dealt with the pandemic due to intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions in them were less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were performed compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative test results for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following graph, the “% Positive Results” column metrics depend on the testing policies adopted in a particular country.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result as a percentage compared to a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of the symptoms of the virus, ceteris paribus.
The rapidly growing cumulative incidence rate of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the UK between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union / European Economic Area and in the UK, thereby confirming that, despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase the level of preparedness for the influx of patients with COVID-19 who will require treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, the Chinese province of Hubei.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the infection is a new type of coronavirus, now known as coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
From this point on, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to currently available data, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, that is, a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most recovering.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease with the need for hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% it takes a critical form when intensive care is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA and the UK with data from Italy for the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance magazine, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria by which WHO determines the presence of a disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU / EEA were recorded in France on January 24, 2020 - all three cases returned from Wuhan, China's Hubei province.
As of March 15, 2020, cases of COVID-19 infection were detected in all 30 EU / EEA countries and in the UK, while for the period from December 31, 2019 until that date, 39,768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths were recorded, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatal cases, occur in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the data on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world every day at 8:00 from official sources, such as their ministries of health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyze COVID-19 distribution trends in the EU / EEA and the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence rate of active cases of COVID-19, the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 for 14 days was calculated taking into account the usual course of COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and in the UK for the period from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on March 15, 2020, compared with data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in the EU / EEA and the UK
The trends in the development of the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over a 14-day period in the EU / EEA countries and in the UK as a whole were consistent with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Fig. 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the UK as a whole began to increase around February 21, and on February 28, 2020 there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU / EEA countries and in the UK, similar trends were observed for an increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
In fig. Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK compared with the same indicator for Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as of 8:00 on March 15 in 15 other EU / EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the different stages in different countries, the differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for recognizing cases and different rules for selecting patients for analysis for the presence of COVID-19, including catch-up testing .
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already as crowded as possible.
Currently, data on admission of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and / or intensive care units in the EU / EEA are available only in 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such information in order to supplement current observational data, the subject of which is the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of a study conducted in 2010-2011, in Europe there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment for COVID-19 presents scenarios for simulating the loading of resources of health systems with estimates of hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and in the UK, when there is a risk of shortage of accessible beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
Since currently cases are grouped in certain regions of the EU / EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a certain territorial group, it is recommended to provide information on cases of infection and the number of beds in intensive care units according to units of the 2nd level of the Nomenclature territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU / EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the scenario of contact infection of SARS-CoV-2, which has been unremitting for a long time, and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who need medical attention and, in particular, intensive care, which for example, can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
According to the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach with the subsequent transition from containment to minimizing the consequences is of great importance for controlling the spread of SARS-COV-2, because, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases among those taking decisions of individuals and hospitals, perhaps there simply will not be enough time to comprehend, adopt and adjust their responses accordingly, if such measures are not taken in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment Report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, then in the coming days or weeks the health system in other EU / EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive care.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoV) cause a mild illness, such as a common cold.
Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have altered our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The appearance of the second type of acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 again attracted attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with its high transmittance, but less pronounced pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very helpful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate carrier vessels of certain human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of carrier animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of animals carrying coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and methods of interspecific transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers, and the influence of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of enveloped viruses with one positive polar RNA strand.
These viruses with the largest genome among RNA viruses containing from 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides are named due to their shape, which when viewed under an electron microscope resembles a corona.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, denoted nsp1 ~ 16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including a spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines of coronaviruses, a number of line-specific accessory proteins are also encoded.
Based on the differences in the protein sequences, the coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacoronaviruses), while the type of betacoronaviruses includes most human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoronaviruses.
For millennia, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecific barriers, and some of them have evolved to pathogens dangerous to humans.
Seven human coronaviruses are known today.
These include the human alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 type 2 acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and / or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARI) and extrapulmonary manifestations symptoms.
The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a nasopharyngeal sample of patients with a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept according to which infection with human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most disastrous epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were ill, and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
Discovered in 2019, a new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of infected exceeded 91,000 people.
An alarm has been received and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonotic origin, their sources are bats, mice or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to the organisms of which the viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but exhibit wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a severe challenge to China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of the origin of human coronaviruses will allow us to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors that limit interspecific transport.
Perhaps it will also prompt or speed up the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the spread of the disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the zoonotic origin, interspecific transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we designate and consider the following general feature: the initial viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic for their reservoir carriers, but acquire a pathogenic character after interspecific transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, according to which an increase in transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E virus strain B814 was first obtained from a nasopharynx sample for patients with a cold, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
Table 1 informatively and graphically presents a brief history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract infections in 1966; subsequently, this virus adapted to multiplication in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed colds, including headache, sneezing, general malaise, and sore throat, although fever and cough were observed in 10–20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of sucker mice.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 virus infection look similar to those of HCoV-229E virus infection, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other airway pathogens, such as type A influenza viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are ubiquitous in the world and, as a rule, are transmitted in the winter at moderate latitudes.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by an approximately two-week illness.
According to a volunteer study, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed a severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the “SARS epidemic,” was the first well-documented pandemic of human coronavirus in human history, and the causative agent of the disease was SARS-CoV, the third identified human coronavirus.
The first case of SARS was diagnosed in late 2002 in Guangdong, China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread in many countries and on different continents.
Excluding overactive distributors, it was estimated that each sick person could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially developed muscle pain, headaches, fever, general malaise, and chills, and among the later symptoms were shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory failure.
Common abnormalities in laboratory findings with SARS are lymphopenia, abnormalities in liver function tests, and elevated levels of creatine kinase.
Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells, and increased macrophage levels.
Approximately 20–30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs can also be infected, including the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been directed towards the study of human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first it was found that it mainly affects young children, the elderly and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, symptoms such as runny nose, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are characteristic.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands with pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it is ubiquitous.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases it causes occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong that same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory infections, has been detected worldwide.
All four of these human coronaviruses, which cause community-acquired infections, are well adapted to humans, and their mutation, which entails highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were not known and their causes are unknown, as in the rare example with the more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtype. which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, acquiring the ability to be effectively transmitted and stored in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but imported cases and spread through episodic secondary cases of infection through close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - progressive acute pneumonia is characteristic of both infections.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%) were registered, therefore MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
In the period from mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, the Chinese province of Hubei, which now, looking back at the past, is associated with an infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 )
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself is called “coronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were registered in the world, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and outside it - 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes severe respiratory infections characterized by fever, coughing and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly go into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Despite the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2, obviously, is less pathogenic, but has a greater ability to transmit than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, indicating the ability of this virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
Comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, coronaviruses transmitted to humans have a similar incubation period and duration of the course of the diseases caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, in severity of symptoms, COVID-19 is located between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most often observed when infected with human coronaviruses, which cause community-acquired infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can be distinguished, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, interesting patterns are also noted that are characteristic of both human coronaviruses causing community-acquired infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission decreases with each subsequent viral transition (i.e., infection of each next person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustained distribution after passage through humans.
All four human coronaviruses, which cause community-acquired infections with mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it is possible that these people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both of them could be called the only survivors of human coronaviruses after the pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses, which cause severe diseases in humans, and people in whom human coronaviruses cause severe diseases, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in the human body sufficiently to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the factors of carrier restriction.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people become infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop transmission among people through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing the common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
The highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses did not adapt well to humans, and their transmission among humans cannot be supported.
They need to conserve and multiply in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of getting into susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or enhancing carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as community-acquired HCoV, at least for the time being.
But it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, enhancing, and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Likewise, the carrier reservoir constantly tolerates HCoV over time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into the intermediate carrier just before or near the time it was introduced to humans, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to replicate at lightning speed and then transmitting it to people, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can transmit a dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission within the intermediate carrier.
In contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the null SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting animals (game).
Further studies of seroprevalence showed that in animal traders the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV virus is higher compared to the general population.
The Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first established carriers of viruses similar and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civet in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not entering the markets, in most cases SARS-CoV was not detected, which suggests that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate enhancing medium, and not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that numerous species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate reinforcing carriers.
All of them appear to be deadlock carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for a natural animal carrier SARS-CoV revealed a closely related CoV of bats, which was called HKU3 SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, associated with SARS and which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88–92% the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that bats became carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in bats, but not one of them, except for the one designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from a sample of feces of bats, uses ACE2 bats, civet and human as a receptor for entry into the cell.
Curiously, the sera of convalescent patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
Today, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of the nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis classifies MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), for virus penetration.
The sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to the sequences of bat betacoronaviruses found in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats matches only 87%.
That is, bats might not be the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that one-humped camels are seropositive for neutralizing antibodies specific for MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal smears of one-humped camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV showed minor symptoms, but massive virus excretion.
It is noteworthy that infected camels secreted the virus not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus isolation in bats.
However, there are still questions, since many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome did not have a history of camel contact before the onset of symptoms and are likely to relate to human-to-human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unidentified animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
The nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% the same as the CoV RaTG13 of bats isolated from the Asian horseshoe race Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to attribute to them the parental relationship.
That is, bats might not be the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
Presumably, the direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which has been associated with many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely case of transmission from animal to human.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), could also carry the parent betacoronavirus, akin to the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes is 85–92% identical to SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with identity at the level of nucleotide sequences of about 90%.
They cluster in two differentiation lines of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
Quite the contrary, the RSD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
An earlier study of sick pangolins also reported the determination of viral contigs in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of assembly and manual processing were used to obtain the genome sequence, which includes about 86.3% of the full-sized viral genome.
It cannot be ruled out that pangolin has become one of the intermediate animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 had the highest sequence homology within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of similarity between pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favors recombination between the pacolin Betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As the driving force behind evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of the HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can be derived from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of strains HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and found in the North American tricolor sucker, has been reported to show a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that camelids could have been an intermediate carrier for it.
For clarity, current knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of a history of interspecific transmission of HCoV.
When interspecific transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred around 1890 and people became infected by domestic animals, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecific transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Bat alfacoronaviruses closely related to HCoV-229E have been detected.
Between them is alfacoronavirus alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was people, not alpacas, who could contact bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, bat alpha-coronaviruses related to HCoV-229E in bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while alpaca alpha-coronavirus caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpacoronavirus alpaca was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas received alpha-coronavirus related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alpha-coronaviruses could serve as the gene pool of the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and one-humped camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecific transmission from bats to single-humped camels and from single-humped camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
Bats obviously provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecific exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats "ideal distributors."
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced by one-humped camels decades ago.
He adapted well to these camels, which from an intermediate carrier turned into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.
Its episodic transmission to humans is an accident, and the person remains an impasse carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be deadlock carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civet in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities of interspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.
First, bats can be a reservoir vehicle for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the ecological niche with bats through coal mining or butchering the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, pangolins may be one of the intermediate enhancing carriers in which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
People become infected by cutting carcasses and eating wild meat.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic ones, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in the third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of host animals, the three main factors from the viruses also contributed to the intersection of interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared with other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of coronaviruses can be considered “moderately high” with an average replacement frequency of approximately 10–4 substitutions per year in one site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening, or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir inhibits the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the mutation frequency can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation frequency, the mutation frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, which indicates a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-humped camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 would quickly lose effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in the genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecific co-evolution favorable for the emergence of new coronaviruses under the appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3′-end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During transcription of the coronavirus DNA in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, the switching of threads often occurs.
Highly homologous full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronaviruses, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-carrier interaction regarding transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor that is important for interspecific transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
In this article, SARS-CoV recombination is given as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection for interspecific transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between strains of human SARS-CoV and civet, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations on RSD protein S.
In general, the coronavirus S protein RSD interacts with the cell receptor and the antibody response of the carrier selects it intensively.
The SARS-CoV RSDs are amino acids 318 through 510 on the S1 fragment, which, for the virus to enter the cell, binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its coreceptors.
SARS-CoV RSD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, making interspecific transmission of the virus possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD that differ from human and civet viral strains, 4 of which are in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civet has K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which can increase the affinity of the interaction of the spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be especially important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of protein S causes the binding affinity of protein S to human ACE2 to change.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this bond is 10–20 times higher than between a human ACE2 and S protein SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine if any other coreceptors are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different segment of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecific transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecific transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of carrier dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, one-humped camels and rodents, may represent a barrier to interspecific transmission.
For successful interspecific transmission of HCoV viruses, it is necessary to usurp dependence factors and subjugate carrier restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of ​​interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be obtained by impartial genome-wide screening of the factors of dependence and restriction of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The diversity of bat coronaviruses creates great potential for the emergence of new HCoV.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential for radical modification of virus phenotypes.
Among accessory SARS-CoV proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was found that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was detected.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with lines of alpha and gamma-coronaviruses, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were detected in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites have also been identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV underwent recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in one-humped camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in the viral genomes, which most likely occurs as a result of getting rid of the virus exerted by selection pressures, for example, from the immune system of the carrier.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to a double nucleotide deletion.
While an intact open reading frame ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alfacoronavirus shows a single nucleotide insertion, which leads to a frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also due to selection pressure on their reservoir carriers.
When bats were infected with coronaviruses, mild symptoms or their absence were recorded, which indicates a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the upregulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2 / CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main histocompatibility complex of class I.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species, which is ensured by the high metabolic activity of bats, can inhibit coronavirus replication, while affecting the reading of exoribonuclease, thereby creating selection pressure to generate virus strains that, when penetrated into a new carrier, are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains can also evolve due to recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for carrier adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared over the past twenty years.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They confidently replicate without causing a strong immune response in the host.
This is the secret to why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
Conversely, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with coronavirus replication.
The same immune response non-attachment strategy may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
In bats, the interferon response is especially strong.
Thus, the intake of type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasomes is impaired in bats.
Based on this, the inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasomes using MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat betacoronavirus was found, the nucleotide homology of which is 95% the same as SARS-CoV, there is also bat coronavirus, the nucleotide homology of which is 96% the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civet and other animals in the markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been established.
Pangolin beta-coronaviruses were found, strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of pangolin beta-coronaviruses could be included in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have attracted widespread attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV animal reservoirs in human transmission.
Convincing evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and civet in the markets, closing the game markets and destroying civet in them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of a variety of lines of pacolin betacoronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection from food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this can occur remains a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in one-humped camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as was done in the wild animals markets of China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop intermittent outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can appear that cause outbreaks of the disease.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in the world.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and (or) more deadly to humans.
To reduce the number of excessive contacts between people and animals, you should abandon the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China.
After rigorous testing, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan is needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the opportunity arises to capture new territories.
Although many properties of bats are favorable for the spread of viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
For a better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, constant mammalian epidemiological surveillance is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
The puzzle of zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.
First, if bats passed the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, then it is necessary to determine how people came into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of the true intermediate carrier is played by the third mammal, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it be a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that in the future, SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be detected on their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
