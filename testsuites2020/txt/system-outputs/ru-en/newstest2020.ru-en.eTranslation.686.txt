how long are these symptoms present?
and all chest pains should be treated this way, especially given your age
and in combination with high temperature
and you also need to check your cholesterol and blood pressure levels
and do you have a high temperature now?
and are you experiencing this pain in your chest right now?
and, moreover, is it difficult for you to breathe
and can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides these?
and how high your temperature was
and I also have a cough
and I have a small cold with a cough
and I have really severe chest pain today
and whether this time corresponds to the hay fever you are exposed to
and chest pain

Do you have other sufferers at home with the same symptoms?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you experiencing shortness of breath now?
Do you still experience chest pain
since it's flu season
but we also shouldn't be left out because of the presence of pain in the chest, which has a cardiological nature
however now the bigger issue is this chest pain
but I have difficulty breathing
but I know a lot of people cough up at me
but we must treat any chest pain with the utmost seriousness
but you're breathing well now, aren't you?
since I don't remember this pain in my chest anymore
Is it like someone is squeezing your chest
you still feel short of breath

do you know what symptoms she had?
do you see this image?
Drink lots of liquid today
however, I take diabetes tests
however she had symptoms exactly like me
How high is your temperature?
what blood pressure do you have?
if you still have a high temperature

I had a fever yesterday
I also had a slightly higher temperature yesterday
I had a temperature yesterday
I'm in severe pain here in my chest
I also have a little difficulty breathing
I will send you an image
I'm experiencing some chest pain today
I have a little headache today and my temperature has risen
I think it's the flu
in my opinion, it's flu in a light form
Does it remind you that it's as if a very, very heavy person is sitting around your neck?
it all started almost simultaneously with headaches and rising temperatures
I have pain in the centre of my chest
it squeals like chest pain
it's in my chest
it's in the center of my chest
it's in the center of the chest
I had chest pain
I am very concerned about this chest pain
I want you to describe this chest pain to me
like high blood pressure or diabetes
how exactly in the centre of the chest
from the high temperature you can now take tachypyrin in the shape of lollipops
but now, Mary, tell me how many days you have had these symptoms
now you've said you feel chest pain
I feel a little chest pain from time to time
well, do you also show any other symptoms besides pain
or is someone sitting on your chest?
exactly the same high fever and cough, head and muscle pain
pain directly in the center of my chest
show me in this image where you feel pain
because you have a high temperature
so you think some of these symptoms could be related to pregnancy?
So are your children showing some of the same symptoms?
tell me about your chest pain
temperature rises at night
The temperature I've had in the last two days

when did you start feeling this chest pain?
Where exactly do you feel chest pain?
where exactly do you feel this chest pain
you experience something similar to feeling embarrassed in your chest
you know, I have diabetes and all that
you said you were experiencing this pain in your chest
COVID-19 apps are mobile phone software apps designed to help with epidemiological investigations into the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options for contact tracking applications have been developed.
This has created a debate about privacy concerns, especially in relation to systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Softer options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, in collaboration with Alipay, has rolled out an app that allows citizens to check if they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. An app called TraceTogether is used in Singapore.
The app was developed by local IT companies, is open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-powered app, StopKorona!, which helps monitor contacts with potentially infected people and ensures prompt communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration with the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracking app was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment within weeks. Similar apps are planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an app with a geozoning function, which aims to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at the University of Cambridge, points out a number of potential practical problems that can arise with app-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if the app is used by only a small fraction of the population.
Given concerns about the proliferation of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related apps to the App Store to include only "official" or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have raised concerns about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related apps; in particular, questions have been raised about whether surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat disappears.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations released a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Organizations have announced the eight conditions they impose on government projects:
surveillance must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by reservations about the expiration date;
the use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating the spread of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties must be determined at the level of legislation;
protection against abuse, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse, must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to solve the problem of continuous surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as this is no longer necessary.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have big potential privacy issues.
However, not all central server systems should have access to personal location data; a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected individuals, but also made information about the whereabouts public, made possible by significant changes to information protection laws that were introduced after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralised and confidential systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been made public.
Contact tracking, which preserves confidentiality, is a well-established concept, with a significant body of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Decentralized protocols include decentralized confidentiality tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, and mechanisms to monitor mobile contacts (PACT).
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal information never leaves the device and that all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality when collecting and using location or path-crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform's work is based on research cited in Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that information.
On April 5, 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols founded a global coalition, TCN, whose goal is to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of applications for tracking and alerting, which is a key factor in their widespread distribution.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in the operation of its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that oversee the operation of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact-tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to keep privacy.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deploy tools to allow governments to create official applications to track the movement of citizens infected with the coronavirus, but with data confidentiality
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with continuous surveillance by first introducing the system through updates to the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove contamination, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal oral transmission.
A person can also contract respiratory illnesses such as influenza or common colds, for example by touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing your baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding your baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or handling raw meat, fish, and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, your hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after procedures for caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or flushing a child down the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
Hand medical hygiene refers to hygiene activities related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for everyone else.
Hand washing is very beneficial for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
as well as reducing the rate of infant mortality in home births.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This elementary procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea by about a third, and this compares with the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
A 48% reduction in cases of diarrhoea could be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory disease (ARD) if appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ARI, is a leading cause of death among children under the age of five, which claims the lives of approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Nearly 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia as a whole.
The United Nations Children's Fund says washing hands with soap before meals and after toilets, which has become a firm habit, could save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention and cut diarrhoea deaths by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out through water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin and, consequently, damage it.
A 2012 Danish study found that too much hand washing can lead to itching and skin peeling - a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too much hand washing can also be considered a symptom of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (diaper changes), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after handling a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching rubbish.
In many countries, hand-washing with soap is fairly rare.
A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the U.S. is closer to the middle, 77%, and the lowest rate was recorded in China, 23%.
The Emergency Medical Care Program, implemented by the Philippine Department of Education, is an example of large-scale interventions to promote child health and improve children's education.
At the heart of this national programme is deworming, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorine.
The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water by itself is not considered an effective means to cleanse the skin, because the fats and proteins that are components of organic contamination are poorly soluble in water.
Sufficient water, however, contributes to the cleansing process.
Solid soap, due to its reusable use, can also contain bacteria that can get onto it in previous use.
A small number of studies focusing on getting bacteria onto the skin from a contaminated piece of hard soap suggest there is little chance of such getting in, as the bacteria wash away with foam.
The CDC still maintains that "liquid soap with a hand dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing."
Antibacterial soaps are heavily advertised in communities that care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or sanitizer has selective effects on organisms that are antibiotic-resistant by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective in relation to antibacterial soaps, their effectiveness may not match those advertised.
In addition to the surface-active substance and skin protection products, complex compounds can contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, dairy) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other suffocations (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
Hot water that is comfortable for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at 37°C body temperature.
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water in removing natural fats that contain contamination and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these remedies are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of thickeners such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or moisturisers such as liquid- or foam-based glycerine, which make these remedies easier to use and reduce the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacillus, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (the 3.5 reduction logarithm is similar to the 35 decibels reduction) on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% - 99.999% of bacteria (the 4-5 reduction logarithm) on the hands 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based sanitizers are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and rear surfaces of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The fingertips on both hands should also be washed thoroughly.
The rise in popularity of such sanitizers is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, however, they should not serve as a substitute for full-fledged hand washing if it is possible to use water and soap.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softeners and/or skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and/or other softening agents to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening components caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in sanitizers are virtually non-existent.
A lower likelihood of irritating contact dermatitis has been a factor in the choice of sanitizers over soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free products do not clean their hands of organic substances, but simply sanitize them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as conventional soaps and water, since, when used, pathogens are still on hand.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizer that does not contain alcohol is largely dependent on components and composition, and historically has been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing agents.
More recently, it has been proven that drugs that use benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, in contrast to alcohol, which has been shown to lose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive side-skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap and are replacing it with gold or clay.
Cinder or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a sanitizer because it forms an alkaline solution on contact with water.
If soap is not available, the WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent contamination, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends hand-washing, which includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.
Precisely running water is recommended, because standing water can be contaminated, but the water temperature just doesn't matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with lots of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as the area between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that when using soap (not just water) people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Wipe your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Carefully rinse your hands under running water.
Hand spraying in standing water can trigger re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on their own.
Wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated. Most often, people ignore areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturising lotion to prevent hand skin from drying out, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: draining water from a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes made and/or using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries.
A foot pedal crane is a simple structure consisting of a container suspended from a rope and a foot lever that must be pressed to drain water onto your hands, using a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on the production of paper napkins and towels; the subject of this study was comparing the level of hygiene of paper towels, warm air hand dryers and more modern streaming hand air dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increases by 194% on average, and on the palms by 254%.
It also emerged that after washing and drying hands in an air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increases by 42%, and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads decreases to 76% on average, and on the palms to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-contamination of several visitors to the toilet rooms and the toilet environment with each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms off the hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other users of the toilet room and bathroom within a radius of 2 meters.
The use of warm-air hand dryers spreads microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 metres from the dryer.
No significant spread of microorganisms was detected using paper towels. In 2005, a study was conducted to assess various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed, depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying paper towels.
Cleaning your hands with sanitizer napkins could be an alternative solution when traveling without soap or water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in inpatient conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps reduce the level of infection.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, with large amounts of soap, water or gel used to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed carefully against each other with fingers crossed.
If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying your hands, closing the faucet and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, a paper towel should be used.
This avoids the repeated contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in medical facilities is to remove pathogens ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities, with large numbers of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spreading microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the rate of blood flow infections associated with catheter use by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting a standard hand washing and treatment procedure to be applied in the health sector.
A draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
The corresponding review was conducted by Whitby in co-authorship.
If regulatory compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization refers to the "five moments" when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before using antiseptic, as well as
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to hand washing soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps kill bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment high in antibiotic-resistant organisms.
All jewellery must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually within 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to rub your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearm should not fall back onto the hands.
After finishing washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after procedures to care for a sick person.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of hand-washing benefited the most, and that very few additional benefits were gained when the rate of hand-washing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing hands with antibacterial soap, washing hands with conventional soap results in a more than threefold increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparing hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, with an average of 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that the treatment of hands with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand-washing alcohol solutions in terms of reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus on hand and the Clostridium difficile dispute.
More research is needed on the most effective interventions in various health facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as cost-effective and an important means to improve health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to inculcate a habit of washing your hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are cheap ways to arrange hand-washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Advocating and encouraging hand-washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in public behaviour.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, it is necessary to monitor and assess the results.
One example of hand-washing propaganda in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's "Three Star Approach" approach, which advocates the implementation of simple cost-effective measures in schools that encourage students to wash their hands using soap.
By enforcing minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of hand washers is one of the possible measures implemented as part of hand hygiene awareness campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of a behaviour-altering awareness campaign.
Some studies looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (preserved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a significantly more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognised in the mid-19th century by two innovators in hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and founder of modern day care.
At the time, most people still believed the infections were caused by rotten smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, with outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections related to medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more vocal in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of the infection.
As a result of the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with "correct hand-washing techniques" were hung next to hand-washers in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "to wash one's hands" means showing one's unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to participate in something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; the phrase subsequently found wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain symbolising an unclean conscience, in relation to the crimes she committed herself and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or observe an unethical act tend to wash their hands more frequently than other people, and for them hand washers are more important.
It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other "cleaning" countervailing activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of a ritual prescribed in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate mandatory hand washing after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
An outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for humanity: so far, more than 3,000 people have died in China and elsewhere in the world, and the number of those infected has exceeded 80,000.
Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity of the disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects the elderly more frequently than the young, and men more frequently than women.
In response to the rapid rise in the number of publications about the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.
We will examine the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope this review will help understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which falls on January 25 in 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout and for weeks after the outbreak of the new viral infection.
Given the high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease as coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread across the country and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated from a range of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarise the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-caused disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS), which broke out in 2012.
We will also discuss the currently known facts about the prevention and prediction of the course of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not lethal to humans and mainly cause approximately 15% of total respiratory illnesses 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e. the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of disease initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with horrific rates of disease.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received by the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatality was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of medical workers, which made it possible to suggest the possibility of transmitting the virus from person to person.
On January 23, a quarantine was imposed in Wuhan, and city public transport stopped working.
On January 24, according to the first clinical trial of the disease, it was noted that 21 out of 41 patients with a confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, the WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak is a global public health emergency.
At the time of the preparation of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2:2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and extent of the danger of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
All age groups were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but mostly people between the ages of 30 and 65 fell ill.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in men (0.31/100,000) than in women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in Hubei province and in nearby regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days passed from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms until diagnosis.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
From the onset of symptoms to the onset of death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days took place.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential rise in the number of infected, coinciding with large-scale transport on the eve of Chinese New Year celebrations.
The mortality rate for confirmed patients was 1.44 percent (95 percent CI: 1.10 to 1.86 percent), and the adjusted mortality rate for patients was 3.06 percent (95 percent CI: 2.02 to 4.59 percent).
The three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (60), and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large envelope viruses containing a single strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In the case of coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of the lining spine (S) binds to the cellular receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, after which membrane synthesis takes place.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the shell glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane to release the virus.
The first reports on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, the genome of which is 99.98% identical to the 10 sequential samples collected in the first flashpoint of the disease, at the Huangan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With the help of translucent electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
It was established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 enzyme in humans weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease of less severity in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFNs; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-size enzyme ACE2 in humans with a resolution of 2.9 - in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence in identifying the coronavirus and infecting it.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target during drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Host
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans via civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was determined that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely the coronaviruses of bats SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what species became the intermediate host, thanks to which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the transmission pathway also remains to be seen.
Mr Ji and colleagues suggested that snakes were the carriers of the virus from bats to humans, during which homologous recombination in the S protein took place.
Based on their research, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou hypothesized that pangolins - long-winged mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference distributed between both genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing sanitizers, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively block the activity of the virus.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, there is no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
As such, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, most notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).4).
Typically, the virus that enters the host body first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognizing receptors (ARRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus triggers the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages in relation to viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Adaptive immune responses will soon be included in the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protective cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the function of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humorous immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in fighting the viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario lead to multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a clustered manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in the city of Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted an average of 3 days, with a spread of between 0 and 24 days.
A later study described above, based on demographic data from 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of the quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease who are asymptomatic.
A 14-day quarantine for those who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus has become a common practice.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often high fever, which can be the only manifestation or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle aches, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus in order to make an early diagnosis, even if there are no pathologies in chest shots.
A demographic survey conducted in late December 2019 found the following prevalence rates of symptoms: 98% high fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of domestic infections and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected individuals.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, who also had high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required artificial lung ventilation, a rate much higher than in patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high fever (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), shortness of breath (40–42%), diarrhoea (20–25%) and sore throat (13–25%), and artificial lung ventilation requires 14–20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this figure, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic survey conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Based on an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of just 2-4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality rates and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher propagation capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with the new virus is lower compared to the latter two.
Thus, containing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Clustering often occurs when contaminated within a family or group of people who have come together for some reason or have found themselves together on some kind of transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, resided there, or came into contact with those infected or sick during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, according to the data presented in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, having been released from hospital, can become carriers of the virus again, and this is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced amounts of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in their peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed with lymphopenia with leukocyte levels of 4x109/L, including leukocyte levels of 1x109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagine aminotransferase and viremia.
In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and subsidence of red blood cells were observed.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin decay present in the blood, was increased and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
Most COVID-19 patients with chest X-rays were found to have pathologies characterized by uneven darkening on both sides or "matt glass"-type darkening in their lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
Uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to significant disruption of gas exchange during the development of RHD.
Dysfunction of type I and II pneumocytes lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung contraction.
As such, the worst X-ray results often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detachment of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, and intertissue lymphocytic infiltration, and multinuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ORS and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19, a method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase) was used.
However, given the high level of false negative results that could accelerate the pace of the epidemic, starting on February 13, 2020, China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on reverse transcriptase PCR).
The situation with SARS diagnosis was similar.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data from disease histories, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and X-ray results.
On February 14, 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for applying the SHERLOCK technique, based on a repeat of CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique enables the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a density of between 20 x 10–18 mol/L to 200 x 10–18 mol/L (10–100 copies per microliter of the original sample) without the use of the equipment.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, could significantly increase the sensitivity of the tests and the ease of conducting them.
Because of the lack of experience in combating the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide COVID-19 patients with only supportive therapy, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or suggested in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressors, steroids, the plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and providing psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs, and may also be less affected by other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, malfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death for patients.
Support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease, is therefore critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulatory technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protecting the functions of vital organs, is essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is a consequence of the overreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammation that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF's, IL-1's, IL-2's, IL-6's, IFN's, IFN's, and MCP-1's.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release huge amounts of free radicals, which become the main cause of the development of RHD and multiorgan failure.
In the treatment of the cytokine storm, especially in patients in serious condition, suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that serve as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other treatments for the cytokine storm based on suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T cells; blockage of the production of cytokines IFN-I, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of yanus kinase; the use of blinatomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4, and histone deacetalase inhibitors.
To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as suppressors of immunity.
However, high-dose steroids do not benefit in treating severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly impair the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium dosages are recommended for use with caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of drafting this document, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.
Remdesivir later also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug to China for pairing studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, alpha-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir can be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
Blood samples from patients cured of a contagious disease have been used to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy populations for a long time.
Indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to combat the pathogen.
Antibodies are found in immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the acuteness of inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood saturation with oxygen increased.
However, in order to suggest that this method be applied en masse before specific therapies are carried out, an as-yet unexamined and undrafted explanation is required.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, it is necessary to carefully examine some shortcomings associated with the use of plasma.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokines ejection syndrome, which, given the toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
Blood antibody concentrations are usually low and plasmas are required to treat critical patients.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to single out the B cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of the effective antibodies or conduct a screening to find effective antibodies against the virus's critical proteins.
In this way, we will be able to immediately move to mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, the Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, since it is difficult to identify and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific COVID-19 therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest percentage of recovered COVID-19 patients was found in a number of provinces in China, which used Chinese traditional medicine to treat 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, the lowest percentage was recorded.
However, this is quite a rough comparison, since the assessment must be carried out taking into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published research materials that compared treatment exclusively using Western medicine and combined treatment using Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the timeframe for normalizing body temperature, relieving symptoms, and providing medical care in hospital settings was significantly shorter in patients who were treated using a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in patients who were treated only using Western methods.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients who started to develop symptoms (from mild to severe) was noticeably lower in the group treated using a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in the group treated using Western methods alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled research conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of particular interest to obtain, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of aspects of the effectiveness of components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques, or their combination.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are mostly fearful of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and those quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including chronic depression, high anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt about the spread of the infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons suspected and in contact with them, as well as to all other people who require it.
As part of psychological support, it is necessary to form multidisciplinary psychiatric care teams, establish clear information with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from infection-carrying animals and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapies used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been carried out on the creation of vaccines based on S-protein, which aim to develop long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Live weakened vaccines against SARS viruses have been developed in animal studies.
However, before starting clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the efficacy of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when used in older patients, the pattern of infection with lethal doses, and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of the disease caused by the MERS virus continue to show up, emerging in the Middle East and spreading to other regions thanks to the preservation of zoonotic sources in the endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins have been developed to combat MERS, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for those without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long period (average 18 months) required to develop the vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only just beginning to show a full picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high rates of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to draw up a predictive model of the disease in order to prioritise their measures, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on clinical trial data presented so far, the following factors may affect disease prediction in COVID-19 patients or be associated with it (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor in predicting the course of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over the age of 50, according to the aforementioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have initial illnesses and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (average 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmia damage.
Cardiology was also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can distort outcomes.
Deviations detected in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor in the course of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase, and creatin kinase can also predict the outcome.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
The main clinical symptoms: In order to predict the results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, it is necessary to take into account data from X-ray examination of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunity suppressors widely used in infectious diseases as complementary treatments to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small dosages and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, amid the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer unforeseen severe stress as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological counselling and long-term support must necessarily be provided to them.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to differ in its characteristics from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet completed their incubation period can, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, making epidemiological controls significantly more difficult.
However, SARS-CoV virus transmission was thought to occur when patients are critically ill, although in most cases early infection did not occur.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic and more difficult to control.
Currently, a lot of work is underway in China, within the framework of which a universal quarantine has been declared in Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as an extended quarantine regime for almost the entire population, introduced in order to break the chain of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures are hugely damaging to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients identified is falling, suggesting a slowdown in the pace of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end by March, and the phase of attenuation will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group, led by Ira Longini, compiled a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nose and throat swabs taken from patients recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current strategies may have had an impact.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola was supposed to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infecting capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken and, over time, it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in kale, which means an oral-fecal transmission method is also possible.
According to one of the most recent studies, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from infection at the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; both surgical masks and N95 respirators (Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent microdroplets of liquid from potentially infected from spreading in the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions ranging in size from 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks stacked together, medical professionals in direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical professionals should wear a figure-fitted protective robe to further reduce the possibility of exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical professionals should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type safety goggles.
All people in affected or potentially endangered regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently with sanitizer, try not to leave their homes in self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high degree of its resemblance to SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, given the experience it gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it wasn't until January 19, 2020, that the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproduction in human-to-human transmission, and that preventing the spread and controlling the disease would not be a problem.
The announcement largely eased social tensions, especially as the entire country prepared to celebrate Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal loss of life.
China's health authorities could learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements because every word is considered by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages of development, rather than reassure the public; and (4) conduct targeted and effective exercises to improve public awareness and awareness.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by a previously unstudied coronavirus of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome II (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and, at the time of the drafting of this document, has spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 outbreak created a sense of relapse in SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the rate of severe cases and death rates among older people are also higher than among young people.
Deaths as a result of SARS are higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in the asymptomatic course of the disease, while patients with SARS usually only infect those around them in severe cases, so it is harder to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative routine samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients can once again show positive tests for the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
Against the backdrop of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some of the most important issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homolog between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot argue that SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.
What animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from its original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation could escalate at any moment.
Molecular-level simulations and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and trigger subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or relapse periodically like influenza?
These aspects are paramount, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but, whatever the cost, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine to be available earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research in its connection.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of CEPI's vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, capacity, scale-up and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the platform's main goals included in Phase I safety studies are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, and RNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 more candidate vaccines were announced, but there is little publicly available information about them (presumably in the planning or development phase).
Phases I-II are pre-tested for safety and immunogenicity, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and in several sites, with the simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing the disease while tracking side effects at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifys viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the aim of starting human testing in 2021.
The launch of vaccine development projects was also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuytmaker, announced the start of work on the development of their vaccine.
Janssen, in collaboration with its biotechnology partner Vaxart, is developing an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used to vaccinate against neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the beginning of trials.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate drug that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materials Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, which are located in western Maryland, announced they are developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of the vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for preclinical trials and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated regimen, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop the vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, announced that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research, they had created a particle similar to the coronavirus.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory tests, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government objected to.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an iRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an iRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it will receive the results of preclinical trials, and their final vaccine candidate drug could begin testing in humans as early as the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced a $4.9 million investment in a consortium to develop the COVID-19 vaccine with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI's total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine amounts to $29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners in developing the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, universities in Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for vaccines in animals.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced 275 million Canadian dollars to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans for a national "vaccine bank" that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of the coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, saying that "MNA administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines, triggering strong responses from antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] that manifested 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that would possibly be produced in the form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers in combination with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they can have other benefits besides their disease prevention properties.
Another randomised trial being conducted in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
Perhaps the vaccines being developed will prove unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies assessing the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to contain infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines available to treat SARS that would be safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat atypical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to circulate, it was thought that the SARS study, which was being conducted at the time, could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatments against the MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that went through Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector vaccines under development, two adenovirus vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Conspiracy theories circulated on social media claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all, and that the vaccine against it already exists.
Publications on social media cited the words of some patients who claimed to have patents for genetic sequences of other strains of the coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a one-way membrane protein of type I, its enzymatically active domain reaches the surface of lung and other tissue cells.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is split off from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II alveolar lung cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth artery muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vasodilating angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, cleaves the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilatatory angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, the binding of the S1 adhesion protein SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires priming the S protein with the serine protease of the carrier TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells could help fight the infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in deaths from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than those with a general risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novelty in therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygenation in piglets with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure of 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 could be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on January 30, 2020, an international public health emergency was declared, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, killing approximately 97,000 people.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
China's death rate is 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually around five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance between people, identifying and ensuring the self-isolation of people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls and closing various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of goods, exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of pupils worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus began to spread online, and there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against citizens of China, other citizens of East and Southeast Asia, or people resembling them outwardly, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of the virus spread.
As a result of the reduction in the number of trips and the closure of heavy industry enterprises, the level of air pollution and carbon emissions has been reduced.
On December 31, 2019, health authorities in the city of Wuhan (capital of Hubei province), China, reported the occurrence of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation into the situation was launched in early January 2020.
The infections were mainly linked to the Huangan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that bears a strong resemblance to the bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, the publication of the South China branch of the Morning Post newspaper, whose information has not been verified, suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China decreased, but began to rise unexpectedly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular, due to the multitude of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would be infected before effective group immunity was developed in the country's population.
The statistics include cases of infection of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose test turned out to be positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted an official policy requiring that no testing be carried out for only minor symptoms.
A study published on March 16 showed that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China until January 23, and that such undocumented patients were the source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
Statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy significantly exceeded the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number of infection (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests the figure could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients recover safely.
In other more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the time of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, around 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of those killed had co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths could be much higher because official figures may not account for deceased people who have not been tested - for example, in the case of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data on Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures by 4-5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual one." His words are supported by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S. Such incomplete records are often found in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was reported in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was reported on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside Asia in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary by region and time of disease spread; they are also influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of health systems used, the time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, sex, and overall health.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
Data vary across regions.
In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio fell from 17.3% (for those who developed symptoms on January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those who developed symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the rate of death as a result of the disease (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the rate of death from the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect indicators of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
Oxford University's Centre for Evidence Medicine estimates that the overall death rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 testing in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of the testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash are undetectable and can vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, a researcher at Pennsylvania State University, argues that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to plateau, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease runs out, they start to die out.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen."
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, argues that "everything could end by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 "would circulate for perhaps a year or two."
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more)," physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University, said: "I don't think this coronavirus will ever go away completely, because it's so easily transmitted," and that it "can turn into a seasonal disease, erupting every year."
The virulence of the new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people can tolerate the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum formation in the respiratory tract (mucus), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, pain in the muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemorrhage, diarrhoea or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists urgent symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent pain or feeling squeezed in the chest, a sudden sense of confusion, difficulty waking up, and facial or lip bluening. If these symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis.
In some infected people, the disease can proceed asymptomatically, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing those who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed under strict control and examining for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from a few units to 44% of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days, usually five days.
Some details about how the disease spread are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small droplets released into the air along with coughing, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, with an open cough, droplets can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets released into the air during conversation, which are capable of staying airborne for longer periods of time. Respiratory droplets can also form when exhaled, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually carried through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests turned out to be positive when tested three days before the onset of symptoms, and this suggests the possibility of transmitting the virus before the symptoms manifest.
There are only a handful of laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact-tracking studies in some countries have also found cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
Employees of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is capable of surviving on surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on the cardboard surface - for one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities are advising washing hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first discovered in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed using household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 bears a great resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the holistic genomic level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus specimens (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin and human viruses.
A holistic genomic comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) exists between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are the intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed based on symptoms, although this must ultimately be confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction analysis with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secretion or by CT scans.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease flow processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT scans or as a first-line test method in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
The WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, and the first of them was published on January 17.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is underway.
It can be carried out on breath samples and blood samples.
The results are usually ready within a period of several hours to several days.
Typically, a nasopharyngeal swab is used for the test, although a yawn swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them were accurate enough to win approval for widespread use.
In the United States, a serology test developed by Cellex has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral turbulence in the type of frosted glass and the absence of pleural swelling.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for compiling an international database of images of confirmed cases of contamination.
Due to its similarity to other infections, such as adenovirus, when identifying COVID-19, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
A major study in China compared chest CT results and PCR testing and found that although the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be deciphered more quickly; in addition, they are more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be seen as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to diagnose the virus using X-rays and computer tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using coughing or sneezing napkins that should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may have already become infected should wear a medical mask in crowded places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance themselves from people. Many governments recommend abstaining from any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among a population whose members do not know where or how they were infected. Medical professionals caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when contacting other people and eye protection.
Governments' use of citizens' whereabouts using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and organisations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organisations, have issued statements demanding that this type of surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile apps for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working to develop solutions to ensure the privacy of personal data - such as registering a user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test has turned out to be positive, they receive a corresponding notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection - for example, nose and mouth rinsing, which is actually ineffective.
Currently, there is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to create it.
Hand washing is recommended in order to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC also recommends washing your hands more frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or when your hands are heavily contaminated, as well as before eating, squirming, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective envelope.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of hand sanitizers based on alcohol with an alcohol content of at least 60%.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with a number of solutions (the sanitizer starts to work on the stainless steel surface a minute after application) with a content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidon iodine.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if COVID is suspected or confirmed at an institution such as an office or day care facility, all spaces in such a facility, including offices, toilets, public areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend covering your mouth and nose with the back of your elbow or napkin when coughing or sneezing and immediately discarding used hygiene products.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks as the use of a mask can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that dissipate in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main method of infection."
The WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those looking after a person with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that using a mask does reduce the number of facial touches.
Several countries have begun calling for medical masks to be used in public places.
CDC centers, USA, recommend wearing non-medical cloth face masks. China has separately stressed the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are urging people to make face cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going outside without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government appealed to all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government obliged all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government has also appealed to citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, which has produced ten million medical masks a day since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks on all passengers on trains and long-distance buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going outside; residents who cannot purchase masks have been advised to sew them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between people.
Protections include quarantine, travel restrictions, closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distancing measures by staying home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many regional governments, particularly those hit hard by the outbreak, are now prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can congregate in one place, according to a recommendation from U.S. government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced from 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gathering in groups of more than two people. Older people and those suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious way. The CDC recommends that they stay home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of the disease in the region.
The use of the term "social distancing" has been understood to mean that people should expose themselves to complete social exclusion, rather than remaining in contact with others in alternative ways.
Among others, recommendations have been made to engage in sexual intercourse only with your regular partners with whom you reside and who you are sure does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many governments have also imposed mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be quarantined on their own.
Strict quarantine has been imposed on high-risk individuals.
Individuals who may have been in contact with contaminated COVID-19, or have recently visited a country or region largely affected by the epidemic, have been advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat the outbreak include curbing the spread of the disease, suppressing it or mitigating it.
Deterrence of the spread of the disease is carried out in the early stages and aims to track and isolate those infected, and also involves other measures of infectious control and vaccination in order to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are being directed at mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Suppressing the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the underlying number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overstretched health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also adopted a series of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
Mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced in South Korea, as well as a system for notifying the movements of infected individuals.
In Singapore, they provided financial support to infected individuals on self-isolation and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Modelling across the UK and the US has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the rise of the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the spread of the disease could reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and the death toll by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if it happens sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when the measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to quell the pandemic imposes social and economic costs.
There are currently no antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter medications for colds, drinking enough fluids and resting can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and breathing support.
The use of steroid drugs can only hurt.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" may relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO sees capacity-building and health adaptation to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the main response to the disease outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health services to help reallocate resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, abolishing non-urgent procedures where possible, identifying the virus and isolating patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and increasing the capacity of intensive care units to train and train staff.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection might have occurred - the so-called "zero patient."
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection likely occurred on December 1, 2019, in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China.
Over the course of the month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the Huangan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the central clinic in Wuhan warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed the WHO of the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about every seven-and-a-half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub and main railway hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two people falling ill in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of March 26, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people have died, and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to curb the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory home stays, mandatory home shelters or isolation), and curfews. As of April 2, some 300 million people, or about 90% of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are isolated in the Philippines, about 59 million people are isolated in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure increased to 2.6 billion people - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the veracity of whose information has not been verified, this date is November 17.
On December 26, Zhang Jixiang, a doctor, was working on a case of mass pneumonia of unknown type, and on December 27, her clinic notified the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a corresponding public notice.
The WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notices, police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
Initially, China's National Health Commission said there was "no clear evidence" of the newly discovered virus's ability to transmit from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war."
The events of the "largest quarantine in human history" began to unfold, on January 23 the sanitary cordon and the ban on entry to and from Wuhan were announced, later the measure spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The city banned the use of personal transport.
In many places, Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled.
Authorities also announced the construction of the temporary Huoshengshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan, was built, which received other incoming patients.
On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools across the country were closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have introduced a number of measures, in particular in relation to schools and universities.
Authorities have introduced remote operation in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei province and beyond.
Public transport schedules have been changed and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Since the outbreak entered a global phase in March, China's authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from "importing" from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was imposed in Beijing for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, there was only one case of domestic transmission of the infection in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei, except for Wuhan, were lifted, two months after the province was closed for quarantine. On March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that from March 28, entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on businesses and factories to resume operations and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread into South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji in Daegu.
Shincheonji followers came to Daegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the church's 9,336 followers, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease. On February 23, 2020, the highest level of anxiety was declared in South Korea.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were reported in Korea, and already on February 29, this figure rose to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed the presence of the virus in three soldiers.
South Korea has rolled out a program to screen the population for the virus, track contacts and arrange quarantine measures for contacts. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory notification of their symptoms via a mobile app by anyone who came from abroad, head-to-head testing for the virus, the results of which were ready as early as the next day, and expanded testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.
South Korea's program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak of the disease, despite not isolating entire cities there. Initially, South Korean society was divided by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they saw as the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections in a single day for four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on April 1 South Korea sought help in testing 121 countries for the virus.
On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be quarantined.
Plans to restrict long-distance travel were announced in March, but intensive travel between cities ahead of the Persian New Year continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became a hub for the spread of the virus after China in February.
Amid claims of a cover-up over the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries have linked their cases to Iran by February 28, suggesting the scale of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
Iran's parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on Iran's prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights activists detained for peaceful dissent, as well as temporarily release all prisoners suitable for this category.
The organisation says there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed facilities such as prisons where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day - the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
By March 23, there were 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour in Iran and one new death from coronavirus every ten minutes.
According to a WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial capabilities in terms of protecting against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the easing of economic sanctions against countries hardest hit by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease entered the territory of Italy, when two Chinese tourists tested SARS-CoV-2, made in Rome, gave a positive result.
The number of infections has skyrocketed, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
It all began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, since 100 people had already died in Italy at that time.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses other than supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for setting the priority for patients to receive medical care, which may need to be implemented.
On March 19, Italy overtook China in terms of mortality from the coronavirus, ranking first in the world, following the announcement of 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in Italy, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that a combination of two factors could contribute to such a high mortality rate in Italy: the high number of elderly citizens in that country and the inability to examine anyone who currently suffers from coronavirus.
The UK has responded to the virus most calmly of all affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticised for not responding quickly and seriously enough to the dangers faced by the country's population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending abstaining from all travel and social contacts that are not of paramount importance, suggesting that people should work from home as far as possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure facilities such as pubs and sports clubs should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of wages, but no more than 2,500 pounds a month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On March 23, the prime minister announced tougher measures to socially distance themselves, banning more than two people from gathering and limiting travel and outdoor activities to occasions of extreme necessity.
In contrast to previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses have been ordered to close, with the exception of businesses that provide "population livelihoods," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, convenience stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, in the Pacific Northwest State of Washington, a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15 was confirmed to be the country's first case of COVID-19.
On January 29, a Task Force to Combat Coronavirus was established in the White House.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed entry restrictions on visitors from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government's leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite this, population testing in the United States was not initiated immediately, and as a result, the true scale of the outbreak during this period was obscured.
Testing was hampered by the failure of test kits released by the federal government in February, the absence by the end of February of a federal government permit to use non-state test kits that were developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and by restrictive criteria before the beginning of March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done by appointment of a attending doctor).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by February 27.
The Atlantic said fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by March 13.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported, "Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's appointment, waited hours or days for their turn for tests." After the first coronavirus death in the United States was reported from Washington State on February 29, Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which other states also soon declared.
On March 3, Seattle schools were canceled, and by mid-March, schools had closed nationwide. On March 6, 2020, a team of epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the projections for the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Additional Appropriations for Readiness and Response to the Coronavirus Act, which gave federal authorities $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to respond to an outbreak of the disease.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences and urged employees to work from home.
Sports events and seasons have been cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions for most of Europe, excluding the UK, for 30 days starting on March 13.
The next day, he expanded the restrictions to include Great Britain and Ireland.
On March 13, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, which made it possible to use federal funds to combat the crisis.
Starting on March 15, many companies began to close or reduce opening hours across the U.S., helping to fight the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that 10,700 cases had been reported in New York in a day, exceeding the total in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing was likely a workable measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases fell from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, 32,308 cases had been reported in New York and 672 people had died. It was reported that on March 26, there were more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in the U.S. than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 had died.
According to media reports on March 30, President Trump decided to extend the period of social distancing until April 30.
On the same day, the 1,000-bed USNS Comfort hospital ship moored in the port of New York.
On April 3, 884 coronavirus deaths were reported in the United States within 24 hours.
New York State has more than 100,000 cases as of April 3. The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information made public, overseeing the public statements and publications of officials and health scientists related to the virus through Vice President Mike Pence's office.
Overall, the opinions of President Trump's supporters about how successfully he manages the crisis are divided.
Some officials and observers have criticized the U.S. dependence on imports of critical materials, including essentials, from China.
In mid-January 2020, an analysis of air travel patterns was published in Travel Medicine, which was used to map and predict patterns of the spread of the disease.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the highest number of travellers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Out of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali has been named the least prepared for an outbreak of the disease, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On February 7, Australia adopted its contingency plan for the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19, and that Australia will pay special attention to border controls and communications in a situation of threat.
On March 21, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.
Thanks to effective quarantine measures applied in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights from their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities gave their permission.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.
Pakistan has stated that it does not intend to evacuate citizens from China.
On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians/relatives of Brazilians, as well as four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian citizen.
Citizens of Poland, China and India landed in Poland, where a Brazilian plane made a stop before departing for Brazil according to the route.
Brazilian citizens visiting Wuhan were quarantined at a military base near the city of Brasilia.
On the same day, 215 Canadian citizens (176 of the first and 39 of the second planes chartered by the U.S. government) were evacuated from Wuhan, taken to Canada's Trenton military base and quarantined for two weeks.
On February 11, another plane carrying 185 Canadian citizens also removed from Wuhan landed at CFB Trenton.
On February 3 and 4, Australian authorities evacuated 277 of their citizens and placed them in a temporary residence centre on Christmas Island, which was converted into a quarantine centre, where they remained for 14 days.
A New Zealand evacuation flight arrived in Auckland on February 5; its passengers (including some from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region) were quarantined at the naval base at Wangaparoa, north of Auckland.
On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. citizens aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner.
On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began the evacuation of its citizens from Iran. On March 14, a South African Airways plane chartered by the South African government departed with 112 South African citizens on board.
A medical examination of passengers was carried out before departure and four South Africans who were found to have signs of a coronavirus were left in China to reduce their risk.
Only South Africans with negative coronavirus tests were evacuated.
The analyses were taken from all South African citizens, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and as a precaution they all remained under surveillance and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the U.S. began partially withdrawing its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) sent their assistance to China.
Some Chinese students studying at American universities have joined forces to collect and send aid to regions of China affected by the virus, with a group from Chicago reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respirators to clinics in Hubei province on January 30.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine development and treatment of the coronavirus, as well as to protect the population of "Africa and South Asia risk groups" from the threat of the virus.
Interaksyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines as a donation after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send $2.26 million worth of aid to China.
Japan also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment there, Russia more than 13 tons of medical supplies, Malaysia announced the donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany sent various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medical supplies, and pledged $100 million in financial support to the affected countries.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicine and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organisation to distribute to its member states.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and five IDPs to Panama.
Ma also donated medicines to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have raised concerns about medical masks and Chinese-made testing kits.
For example, Spain has withdrawn 58,000 Chinese coronavirus testing kits that provide accuracy as low as 30%, and the Netherlands has withdrawn 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were supposed to have been made in China, but later turned out to have come from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency relief operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
The WHO noted clear differences between the situation with the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004, during which Chinese authorities were accused of classified information, which allegedly hindered the prevention and containment of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government "regularly provided updated information about the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year."
On January 23, in response to a decision by central authorities to impose a travel ban on Wuhan, WHO spokesman Godin Galea noted that, while "this measure was definitely not recommended by the WHO," it was also "a very important reaffirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at its most prevalent place," and called it "unprecedented in public health history."
WHO Director-General Mr Tedros Adanom said PHEIC's announcement was driven by "the risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr Tedros said there was "no reason for measures that unnecessarily hinder international movement and trade" and that "the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement."
On February 5, the WHO asked the global community for $675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for emergency assistance to those countries that "don't have systems in place to identify people infected with the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached those countries."
Mr Tedros also said that "the indicator of our readiness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link," and urged the international community to "make a choice: invest today or pay the price in the future." At a press conference on 11 February, the WHO established the official name for the disease - COVID-19.
That same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem."
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group has been created, coordinating all United Nations responses; these steps, the WHO says, will "focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to tackle the disease outbreak more broadly socially and economically."
On February 14, WHO and China initiated the creation of a joint ad hoc group that ensured the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the situation at home and assessing the "seriousness of the disease and its contagion," organized workshops and meetings with leading national agencies, as well as field visits to assess the "effectiveness of the response at the provincial and county level, including urban and rural areas."
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, the WHO sent a joint team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said the likelihood of a global spread of the coronavirus would be raised from "high" to "very high" - the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, chief executive of the WHO's health emergency programme, warned in a statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet's readiness for the real state of affairs: it's time to act.
The virus may be on its way to your country and you need to be prepared," while also stressing that the right response could help the world avoid a "worst case scenario."
Ryan also said current data did not warrant the announcement of a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the announcement of a pandemic would mean "we essentially recognise the fact that every person on the planet would be at risk of contracting this virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said the WHO was "deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the issue."
In response to the current situation, a petition was filed against the Director-General of WHO, Mr Tedros Adanom, offering to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of every person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to apply life-saving measures to him, and the government is responsible for organizing such measures.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including people with disabilities, members of minority groups, senior citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are looking at the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has created a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.
The digital hub contains information on Country Policy Tracker policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
China's government has been criticised by the United States, UK Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for taking action to combat the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have been sacked for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these sackings indicate discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but sided with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that "censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus, which has now become a global pandemic," and the remark has in turn been criticized by some commentators who argue that this approach is racist and "distracts from the failure of the U.S. presidential administration to contain the spread of the disease."
The Daily Beast gained access to a U.S. government cable that contained a communications strategic cunning apparently devised by the National Security Council, with references to the strategy being made: "It's all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information by any means possible, including press conferences and television appearances." Organisations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of a "propaganda push" to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of a "geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through PR and so-called generosity policies."
Borrell also said that "China is pushing hard on the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States."
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba came under a ban due to U.S. sanctions imposed on April 3.
US authorities are also accused of diverting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
Disputes have also arisen over medical masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IDPs destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticised the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus-ridden Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China has reacted bilaterally.
This is clearly not indicative of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the dispatch to Italy of Russian military caregivers, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or of little benefit to Italy."
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on the global public at a "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a medically-assisted cargo plane to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the rate of production, they will also be able to provide reciprocal assistance if necessary."
NATO's Defender 2020 military exercise, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States - NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War - will be conducted in an abbreviated format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised Defender 2020 (Defender 2020) exercises: "In the current public health crisis, these exercises endanger the lives not only of the U.S. military and many European member states, but also of residents of countries where such activities are to take place." The Iranian government has been hit hard by the virus. About two dozen members of parliament, as well as fifteen other current or former politicians, have been infected.
On March 14, 2020, the President of Iran Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, appealed to world leaders for help, saying that his country is experiencing difficulties in fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran.
Political analysts expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea slammed Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen coming from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in government-designated places.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they saw as the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
Some commentators have expressed concern that the move will allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orban the indefinite right to govern by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been cited as the cause of several supply shortages due to a global rise in the use of equipment to fight the epidemic, the purchase of goods amid panic and disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment, stemming from increased consumer demand and supplier failures.
Panic purchases also took place in several communities, leading to a situation where essentials such as foodstuffs, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General, Mr. Tedros Adanom, demand for personal protective equipment has grown 100-fold.
The jump resulted in a twentyfold increase in prices compared to normal prices, as well as delays in deliveries of medical devices for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and the WHO has warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, buyers of the daigou system were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as high demand for food, severe food shortages were avoided in both areas.
Measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and the illicit trade in critically important products, which proved successful, avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but according to industry representatives, prices for agricultural products could rise.
The shelves of food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials secured access to pork stocks to provide adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve food supplies in case of emergency exist in Italy.
Damage to the global economy has taken its toll on China: according to media reports on March 16, China's economy suffered badly in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures taken by the government to combat the spread of the virus, which saw retail sales fall by 20.5%.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub; therefore, it is believed that the viral outbreak poses a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
According to forecasts by Agate Demarai, an employee of the Economist Intelligence Unit, volatility in the markets will continue until there is a clearer picture of the potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could surpass that of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
According to one estimate by an expert from Washington University in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to take "urgent measures" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets crashed due to a significant rise in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, amid growing fears of a coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points - the biggest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10 percent drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again on concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, with the biggest fall occurring on March 16.
Many believe there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the hardest hit sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to take any trips.
As a consequence of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for airfares, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of China's New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events involving large numbers of people, including annual New Year's festivals; private companies have also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's Eve events were cancelled and tourist attractions were closed in order to prevent mass congestion; for example, in Beijing, the Forbidden City was closed and traditional temple fairs were cancelled.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities have extended the New Year holiday until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the rate of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year's celebrations. The retail sector has suffered globally, with store opening hours cut and some stores temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50-60%.
As a result, in March, attendance at shopping centres fell by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures such as improving sanitation, installing equipment to check visitor temperatures and cancelling events.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China's 300 million rural migrant workers ended up at home in their country's provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the government for help.
The self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed on a daily basis. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households faced unemployment one way or the other in the middle of March. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs in Spain since the start of the year.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Nearly half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to a government-subsidised reduced work schedule - part-time.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and Britain.
Areas of art and cultural heritage have also been hit hard by a pandemic that has affected organisations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Culture and art organisations have tried to support their (often state-funded) mission of ensuring access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting people of the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely around the world, or access to them was limited to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or moved to other dates.
In return, active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
There have also been disruptions in the film industry. The Vatican has announced the cancellation of Holy Week events in Rome, which take place in the last week of the Christian penitent period - Lent.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live, or on television, while some church leaders are proposing open-air services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also cancelled services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, churches and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak and shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia has banned the access of foreign pilgrims and its own residents to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes to the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "rescheduled for the period beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or cancelled.
The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also canceled all of their shows.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun exploring options for continuing their activities and sharing their results online, organizing live streams of online concerts or web festivals, and helping people in creative professions continue to perform, publish or publish their works.
Numerous Internet memes about the coronavirus have appeared online, many of which are humorous and smooth out the anxious moods typical of periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an intensification of bias, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as against members of the population of hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports for February (when the majority of infections were still limited to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for something.
Some African countries are also seeing an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origins.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in areas affected by the virus, have been supported both offline and online.
Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed an early petition insisting on banning Chinese citizens from entering their countries to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag "ChineseDontComeToJapan" was leading the way on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report rising levels of racist attitudes and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics see the opinion as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanzhar.
Students coming from China's bordering northeast India and studying in India's major cities have reported cases of harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, said the Chinese destroyed nature and "therefore God took revenge on them."
The remarks were later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta as a "misconception."
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made public their scientific papers on the coronavirus outbreak.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on the publishing servers of preprints, such as bioRxiv.

Wild animal smuggling and animal-borne diseases are health risks associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Drug repositioning (also known as reprofiling, redirection, task reversal, or therapeutic redirection) is the reprofiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition other than the disease originally envisaged in development.
This is one area of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains around 66 drug-resistant proteins, each of which has multiple ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites serves as a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papine-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP-ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analysed their similarity in structure to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug that would be recommended for clinical trials.
Chloroquin is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among four drugs being investigated as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in upstate New York on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with the Emergency Application Permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is only permitted under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalised but cannot receive treatment under clinical trial schemes.
The CDC stated that "the procedure for the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine administration for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there is "no other way out."
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langone is studying the safety and effectiveness of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is "unambiguously effective."
35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug had a negative result after an average of 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take the drug had a duration of 11 days.
A study was conducted in Wuhan, in which 240 pneumonia patients were monitored, one half of whom received favipirapiravir and the other half umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results showing the effectiveness of the drug are scant and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it will purchase the drug in Japan to replenish its stockpiles, and will use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing the drug. The drug may prove less effective in neglected cases of the disease.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to conceive.
One study on the combination of the antiviral drugs "lopinavir" and "ritonavir" (Calettera) concluded that "the effectiveness of the use of the drugs has not been found."
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.
The WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences researchers discovered that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of phylo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.
Three trials are currently underway for intravenous vitamin C administration for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, trials of the antibiotic azithromycin began in the state of New York.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclosonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for its use in treating presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, involves 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalised with severe forms of the disease in order to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were invited, with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who are breastfeeding and do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in this study.
In Italy, several coagulants are on trial.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Authority to publish guidelines for the use of the drug.
On April 14, a multi-center study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy to study the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on reprofiling approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been deemed potentially usable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also trials in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab’COVID-19.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the application of occupational safety and health practices in order to control risk and combat the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk control depends on place and workload, based on risk assessment, community epidemic severity and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) said lower-risk positions have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic infection control measures are required, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home for signs of illness, adherence to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to become infected due to the ongoing spread of the disease in society or on international trips.
This category may include employees who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, and in some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that staff at medical facilities and morgues who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection of COVID-19 to be at high risk, with the level of risk increasing to very high when such staff perform procedures involving the formation of aerosols or collect/process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such employees include the use of engineering and technical safety equipment, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task concerned.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of impacts in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others, or fear of contamination.
Commercial patterns can change both with respect to the types of goods that are in demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (for example, making purchases during off-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there could be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographic regions affected by COVID-19. A Preparedness and Response Plan could be used to organize protection.
The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of contamination, risk factors arising at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as the elderly or the presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the controls needed to address these risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that could arise from the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the targets for responding to the epidemic include reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations and minimising the negative impacts on other organisations in their supply chains.
The response is affected by the severity of the diseases in the community where the business is located.
A risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 disease cannot be eliminated, the most effective engineering and technical safety equipment is then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection equipment.
Engineering security means isolating employees from workplace risk sites and not relying on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes to working policies or procedures requiring action from an employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help address some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the threat to the employee, fit in size (e.g. respirators), used continuously and properly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of in order to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) believes the lowest-risk positions have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand-washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including closing their mouths when coughing and sneezing, providing napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and conducting daily cleaning and disinfecting work environments.
Rapidly identifying and isolating individuals who could potentially be infected is a critical step to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the heat stops, the absence of elevated body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of anti-inflammatory drugs or other medications to relieve symptoms, and mandates that policies on sick leave be flexible, that employees be allowed to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in society in the area where the business is located, or due to the recent trips of such person to the COVID-19 distribution site.
These categories include employees who have been in contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments and some large retail stores. Engineering and technical safety tools for such groups and higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation intensity, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic safety screens, and the installation of windows for customer service without leaving the vehicle.
In rare cases, workers at this risk may be required to wear respirators.
If a person falls ill on a plane, measures are required to ensure the proper safety of employees and other passengers, such as isolating a sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for a sick person, providing a sick person with a mask, or asking such person to cover their nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching an ailing traveller or when coming into contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if they have a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include delaying travel in the event of illness, self-isolation, and promptly informing a medical centre on the ship if there is heat or other symptoms on board.
In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person is in a school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or medium level of infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling outings for face-to-face meetings, meetings and other mass activities such as exercise or choir singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between parties, adjusting arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for long-term non-attendance at school could be considered. For law enforcement officials performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officials required to contact those with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines prescribed to ambulance paramedics, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during detention, workers must clean and sanitize their uniform belts and equipment before reuse with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, comply with standard operating procedures for preventing the spread of disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as for the use and washing of clothes.
OSHA believes that some categories of health workers and morgues are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include care workers, support workers, laboratory and medical transport staff contacting patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of contamination when performing procedures associated with aerosol formation, or when collecting/processing samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 contamination.
Procedures associated with aerosol formation include sensing, cough-causing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue workers include employees handling the bodies of people with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such employees perform an autopsy, they move into a very high-risk category.
In some health facilities and morgues, the use of special negative pressure ventilation can be an effective measure.
Samples should be handled in accordance with the precautions provided for biological safety level 3.
In addition to other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting up to 6 feet away with patients with confirmed illness or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as for those undergoing procedures associated with aerosol formation.
In the U.S., NIOSH-approved face respirators with an N95 or higher filter must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which specifies requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for an employee. The WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not through physiological fluids.
The WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff screening at the patient reception point.
For those collecting airway samples from COVID-19 patients or carriers of the disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective goggles or face shield, bathrobe and gloves.
When performing procedures accompanied by the formation of an aerosol, the respirator N95 or FFP2 should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the insufficient availability of personal protective equipment around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment through the use of remote medicine capabilities, physical barriers, such transparent windows, ensuring access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only those personal protective equipment that are necessary for a specific task, the continued use of the same respirator, without removing, when working with multiple patients with identical diagnoses.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the millionth line of infections around the world
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million.
COVID-19 coronavirus killed at least 52,000 people.
The border came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first case of infection, and Zambia recorded the first case of death from a coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that did not record cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours leading up to 10:00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there were more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by a coronavirus infection were recorded in the U.S. on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the regime of self-isolation of citizens of the city until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians throughout the country, despite their self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days; the result was 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while previously the curfew only lasted from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state's home-isolation regime has been extended by an order until May 1.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms can include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually around five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are reduced to mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease develops into viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people have died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread by close contact between people, often through microscopic droplets released into the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are formed when exhaled, they usually pose a threat by hitting the ground or the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching the contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken like a nasopharynx swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients suspected of the disease, as well as for caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population vary: some agencies recommend not using them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected individuals may not have symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or feeling compressed in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, facial or lip bluening; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat, may be less common.
There are also gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, in different percentages.
Some cases reported in China initially showed only a feeling of compression in the chest and a palpitation.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, organ failure, and eventually death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmitting the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of people infected with the asymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown and is only being studied; however, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
China's National Health Commission has begun including asymptomatic cases in its daily report since April 1; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) declined asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
When speaking loudly, more droplets are released into the air than when speaking at normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that, with an open cough, droplets can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and testing of air recycled by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through faeces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before symptoms appear, but this risk is small.
Employees of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is capable of surviving on the surface for several hours to several days.
Specifically, it was found that the virus can live on a cardboard surface for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces for up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, if used properly, have a fairly beneficial effect in terms of combating contamination: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and is also capable of removing it from skin surfaces and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical sanitizer), are less effective against the virus.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest content of the virus in the blood was revealed on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe Acute Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome, first found in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19 as the virus enters host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.
The virus binds to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell using the characteristic surface glycoprotein, the "spike" (peplomer).
12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe forms of the disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large amounts in the heart because they are involved in the work of this organ.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in OIT with COVID-19, and may indicate adverse prognosis. The autopsy of patients killed by COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocyto-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 flux show symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF T cells were found to correlate with recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also found during the autopsy.
The WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab, but a nose swab or sputum sample can also be used.
The results are usually ready within a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists managed to single out the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world could independently develop tests using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of an infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were under development, but have not yet become widespread.
Chinese experience studying the results of these tests showed that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing its use later this month.
Bilateral multipartite subpleural seal foci, like "matt glass" with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distributions, are frequent symptoms detected early in the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobblestone pavement (a longitudinal thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological examination performed during the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia severity:
mild form of pneumonia: lung swelling, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multinuclear giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DVS syndrome); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, adhering to respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to perform a high-quality hand hygiene procedure.
Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restricted the movement of citizens, and cancelled major public events.
Recommendations on distance also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no proven drugs against COVID-19.
The CDC also recommends washing your hands more frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or when your hands are heavily contaminated, as well as before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol sanitizer (alcohol content is at least 60%) for hand treatment, but only when soap and water are not available. In regions where such sanitizers are not sold, the WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturiser.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which can include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, adherence to personal hygiene rules, a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published guidelines for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource - the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend opting for paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health facilities, when performing procedures that can cause airborne droplets, such as intubation or hand drying.
Medical professionals caring for people with COVID-19 are recommended by the CDC to be placed in an air drop insulator (AIIR) - an additional measure in addition to standard precautions in terms of contact and air. The CDC has published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: a protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection products and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial environments, but the FDA has permitted the use of these respirators under the Emergency Application Permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used without instructions, effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, making masks yourself at home.
In most cases, COVID-19 flow patterns are not heavy enough to require artificial lung ventilation or alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is needed.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is currently being actively studied, with some evidence suggesting that intubation can be avoided with a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of the two treatments for critically ill patients is as effective as ARVs.
Some doctors are opting for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the nasal cannula with intensive airflow.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp rise in cases of COVID-19 contamination in severe forms requiring hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for lung ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of providing artificial lung ventilation is complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops in COVID-19, and oxygenation cause more problems.
Inhaled-pressure IDPs and IDPs are essential to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure that they are minimally damaged by ventilation, which can lead to the development of pneumothorax.
On earlier fan models, high PCBs may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
The development of new drugs could last until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers are taking part in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to use reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is at serious or immediate risk.
Its use has not been subject to clinical trials, which should be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak of the disease.
To log in, users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect "close contact" using surveillance data and therefore identify the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. The analytics of large data collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence - such tools are used to track infected people and individuals they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government granted permission to security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people who are believed to be infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine offenders.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said cellphone operators reported that "40% of people still continue to move around the area."
The German government ran a 48-hour weekend programming marathon in which more than 42,000 participants took part.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may be stressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for damaging people's mental health and wellbeing."
The disease can occur in mild form with little or no symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Patients with a mild form of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while it can take three to six weeks to treat patients with severe or critical forms.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although there is no such data on COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In those with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock or organ failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, as well as heart, kidney and liver problems.
Thromboforming abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while impaired kidney function was observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage case studies, the average time from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women was 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples suggest diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart problems were due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary by state due to such regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.
Insufficiently effective counting of light cases can lead to an overstatement of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were generally 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The administration of one of Hong Kong's clinics found that some patients recovering from the disease had their lungs reduced by 20-30% and their scans revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to "After Intensive Care" syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who recovered from the virus were developing permanent immunity against it.
Judging by the flow of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but there have also been reported cases where, after recovering from COVID-19, tests for the coronavirus still turned out to be positive.
It is believed that in these cases there was an exacerbated protracted course of the disease, rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal-derived, and contagious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from person to person.
A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, cites December 1, 2019, as the earliest date for the first case of the disease.
According to official data released by the WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of disease spread, and are also influenced by testing rates, quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the disease emergency codes for ICD-10: U07.1 - for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 infections - for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV- infection 2. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure varies by region. Some other methods include determining the disease death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, and determining the death rate as a result of the transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the time of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have undergone the infection, the presence of such antibodies makes it possible to understand how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of the carnival among young people, causing a relatively lower death rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths could be officially classified as such.
Furthermore, Germany's health system was not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, around 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by blood donation rates.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to research conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women only narrows from the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, co-morbidities in men (e.g., hypertension manifested in men at a younger age than women) may be the cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ARVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women, so they are more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of the WHO, Mr Tedros Adan Gebreyesus, explains: "CO" means "crown," "VI" means "virus," "D" means "disease," and 19 is the year the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, the WHO additionally uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19."
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as a "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "coronavirus" and the "Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, in accordance with 2015 guidelines on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, the WHO recommended the use of the terms "acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names - "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2" were published.
Due to restrictions on the volume of standard supply chains, some manufacturers of digital services are printing medical materials, such as swab tampons from the nose, as well as parts of IDP devices.
In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required timeframe, when one of the local facilities was redesigned and was able to print the required 100 valves overnight.
After the COVID-19 outbreak first erupted, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread rapidly online.
It is likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
Currently, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs to treat it.
Currently, various international studies of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 are being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial programme, which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no ready vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous studies conducted using SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers aim to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to trigger a rapid immune response from the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies aim to break down the S-spike protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-assisted amplification has been identified as one potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
The drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of these studies were on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drug reprofiling accounts for most of China's research; by the end of April, nine Phase III trials on remedies had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. To this end, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. Chinese guidelines for the 7th edition also list interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as anti-COVID-19 agents.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that in order to penetrate SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to attach the spike protein to the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a late-stage complication of the severe form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have the properties of hypercytokinemia. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
The drug entered stage 2 of a non-randomised test, which is being administered nationally in Italy, after positive results were obtained from its use in patients with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a blood serum test for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies to treat steroid refractory cytokines release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomised and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokines release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is now seen as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tried in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results were inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, could be scaled up.

Stores in Australia are limiting the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time in all of the country's stores to two and one, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were reported in ads at the box office, as well as on the network's Facebook page.
Citizens have reportedly begun to make emergency supplies because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths chain also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5 respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packages.
The Coles retail chain said in a March 8 press release that, with the introduction of a four-pack cap, "in many stores, toilet paper is still being sold too quickly - one delivery within an hour," and described such demand as "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook post published on Tuesday, described the trend as "unexpected."
A Woolworths spokesman said last week saw strong sales growth.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited the number to two packages.
To fill the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased delivery rates, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI stocked up on a special early-sales promotion on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Association of Retailers, said retailers are trying to restock but this is being hampered by local authority restrictions on truck travel schedules.
He expects production costs to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but there are fewer and fewer profitable offers available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to depletion of inventories, some stores could not hold shares on Wednesdays.
In a report to news.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores were restocking every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the number of inventories is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, reinforcing the sense of shortage of supplies.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizer could be placed on these shelves in large numbers, shoppers probably wouldn't panic like that," says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, reported that stocks were running out.
Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper company Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also makes Sorbent products, said they were working around the clock to provide enough goods, according to news.com.au.
Domain.com, a property website, said that when Melbourne auctions fell due to a lack of buyers on Labor Day week, some property sellers began offering first bidders free toilet paper.
The Thursday edition of the Darwin-based daily NT News included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of items purchased, saying they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, haberdashery, hand washing products and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, it was noticed on Sunday night that the online store of British supermarket Ocado also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.

THEME: [Covid-19] Load relief and preparation for the future
DATE/SENDING TIME: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
DESCRIPTION: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we are living in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the capacity to sympathise, collaborate and develop communities around the world that underpins such an organisation.
We observed friendly and caring relationships between all of our colleagues, reflected in emails, calls and chats - a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, thankfully, amazing people work with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of a high assessment of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.
And it's possible because of your work, whether it's to make websites work, pay our colleagues, or protect the safety of communities.
The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and today this is even more important than ever before.
At such a time, in order to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
Due to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will be making important changes to the way we work together starting in the coming week.
Adjusting the order of our work and schedules
As Robin previously said, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
During the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve tensions and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back down, then so be it.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff:
According to our expectations, it will take about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are received.
We do not announce days off: if you can work properly for more hours, it is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now; whatever your needs, whether it's taking care of your relatives, purchasing foodstuffs or going to a doctor's appointment, your wellbeing is our number one priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you get sick, you shouldn't work.
This is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
There's no need to file a sick leave or holiday: just inform your supervisor and help the team revise its calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, tell Brian from T&C Ops so T&C can provide support and due care from management to your situation.)
Payment of hourly rates will be carried out in full.
We have already announced and reaffirm our intention to abide by commitments to our contractors and employees at an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will receive payment according to normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you can't work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we're doing can bring amazing results, especially at times like this.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask that you communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support these types of activities.
Teams from SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
A slowdown today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work "two more to catch up" after the end of the pandemic.
You won't have to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognise that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines, as far as possible.
What happens to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to adjust to the new reality and expectations for the volume of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeframe for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the timeframe for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing employees to prioritise critical work, self-care and care for loved ones, while ensuring that everyone who needs or wants to work has a reduced timetable for the next few weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organisation.
Next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, providing representatives and teams with up-to-date information on the next steps immediately after receiving the appropriate confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for leading this effort.
The state of the office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to a host of precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to sanitize all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to sanitize all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevator halls, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules, which require caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our D.C. (DC) office is on the WeWork network, which has shared its COVID-19 rules with us and all staff based in DC.
Last week, our D.C. office moved completely to remote work in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed renting a space in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one to two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them down into a course of several days.
Define clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out materials in advance for familiarization.
By default, use video to facilitate interaction and communication, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator - the person who will monitor the receipt of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as responsible for keeping notes (or joint notes).
If you need to use a handy headset, contact technical support by email.
Take advantage of your Wellness Reimbursement benefits when purchasing snacks.
Connect to Slack's channel, ’remoties, to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organisation.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded mass events such as editathons until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of carrying out agreed grant arrangements and no one will be fined for forced delays or alterations to such objectives.
This coming week, we will hold follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general mood in the global community is not only an upset about the interruption, but also some sense of relief about mutual understanding and the ability to focus on one's own communities, Wikimedia and more.
On the outlook, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide community space to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to a special staff meeting on your calendar next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to additionally share up-to-date information, answer your questions and spend time together by connecting to each other.
We are together in this situation and are ready to help all we can.
In this case, you can still receive information from such e-mail, and other important information about COVID-19 - from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflow, issues with reporting, or if you need any other assistance, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and provide communication as needed.
If you have privacy concerns, email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a repudiation of our work and our commitments.
On the contrary: it is an acknowledgement of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and provide an opportunity to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world through the right service.
Our scheduled work will wait until the appropriate times.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the coming weeks and possibly months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with the utmost commitment as soon as the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 "suspicion cases" and "confirmed cases" need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our group published a short guide to diagnosing and treating the new coronavirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on the experience we have accumulated and makes sound recommendations to combat this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "cases of suspected illness" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the document "Diagnosis and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19" (Seventh Version), issued by the National Health Committee of China.
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially called coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called "severe acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication attracted a lot of attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven issues of the document "Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19", published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), were published, and the content of some of its provisions significantly changed.
Recently, a paper prepared by Zhou and co-authors commented on our recommendations, which contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on this global pandemic.
We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Therapy Recommendations (Test Seven) and the results of ongoing research, their work needs updating.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (from March 3, 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming the case of suspected disease, it is necessary to combine one element of the characteristics of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movement or residence in Wuhan and its environs or in other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) the history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surroundings.
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
Diagnosis for a confirmed case of the disease should be based on suspected disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence points, namely: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) genome-wide virus sequencing shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies; and (2) genome-wide viral sequencing with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
It can also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues of this document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) issues; and then in the seventh issue, the need for serological proof was added.
These changes are based on continuous work by researchers looking for the best nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as analysis of airway samples, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.
However, there is growing evidence of the need to exercise caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of Zhou et al. must be updated, since it classifies individuals without clinical symptoms as a "low risk" group.
The assessment system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
In terms of diagnosing "suspicion cases" and "confirmed cases," we encourage readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations given in the countries where they reside.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths - day high
Yesterday Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 in a day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said 114 current cases were reported as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were reported.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr Mirjabi, two of the deceased were aged over 60, two were aged between 51 and 60, and one was aged between 41 and 50.
She also said the two dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic employee told local news outlet Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Maitri Clinic.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport operations have been suspended since 26 March and were due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
Transportation of essential goods - medicines, fuel and foodstuffs - was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, the three men had already recovered.
World Health Organization announces COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "pandemic" only describes the extent of the disease, not the danger of specific cases, the WHO notes that governments need to take action:
"All countries together are still able to influence the progress of the pandemic."
This is possible if countries are engaged in identifying, testing, treating, isolating the sick, tracking the occurrence of the disease, and mobilising their citizens," explained WHO Director-General Mr Tedros Adan Gebreyesus.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming rate of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming rate of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said in an interview aired on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus other than influenza has yet been monitored from its inception until the continual global spread."
Mr Gebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.
We've also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance, and then gave it a new status: a pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: "It's just the beginning, it's going to get worse."
As of Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 had been reported worldwide, and more than 4,600 people had died, according to the Associated Press.
Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognises the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostics and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have experienced the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to be treated in hospital, or who were absent altogether.
The exact death rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By March 23, no country had been able to verify more than 3% of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries is highly contradictory.
It is likely that such differences in data have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries can be greatly exaggerated.
With a real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on airway samples obtained in a variety of ways, including a nasopharynx swab or a sputum sample.
Results are usually available over a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OT-PCR test, carried out on swabs taken from the throat, is only valid during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, however, continuing to multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, an alternative could be to take material from the lower respiratory tract using a suction catheter, or to use snatch (wet) products.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the UK has also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on clinical-level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the "E" gene common to all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. China's BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive permission from China's National Drug Administration to use the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based detection kit urgently.
One in three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed per day on average throughout February 2020.
Tests using the two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency permit. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the fence and analysis processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology, VEKTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use the test, which can be conducted for 3.5 hours on a large sample volume, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to conduct tests of the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA from the FDA for a test lasting around 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses amplification technology for isothermic nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and there is hope for results in 15-20 minutes, similar to the rapid flu test.
A March 2020 review of specialist literature concludes that "breast X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computer tomography] results can have such value even before symptoms appear."
Typical signs identified during CT include bilateral multipartite subpleural seal foci of the "matt glass" type, with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distributions.
Subpleural dominance, cobblestone pavement symptoms and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the onset of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT scans or as a first-line test method in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
Part of the immune response to the infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infections in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct population controls. The tests can be conducted in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses a single peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncturing the skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies that have the ability to fight the virus in blood samples.
Testing performance is several hundred samples over several hours and, as such, this method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. At the beginning of April, the UK found that none of the antibody tests it acquired produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of the virus to stay at home: "emergency department staff hand the patient a test tube for a sample," the patient spits it in, gives it back, and after some time receives the results of the test. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient contracting other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it is used for transport.
Express testing centres have helped South Korea set up one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On March 2 in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said it was ready to carry out around 12,000 tests a day in outpatient settings, and a week earlier they could do just 10,700 tests a week.
If an examination is prescribed by a doctor, then the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the president of the Institute Robert Koch, the total performance of Germany in terms of testing is 160,000 tests a week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct rapid testing in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of calendar week 12/2020, at SARS-CoV-2, a total of at least 483,295 tests were taken, up to week 12/2020, inclusive, and on 33,491 samples (6.9%) the result was positive.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and therefore quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
After the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai were immediately opened - in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total throughput rate was 50,000 tests a day. Open multiplex Origami Assays have been released, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to shortages and insufficient reagents, mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have turned to protocols for processing test samples, which involve heating samples at 98°C (208°F) within 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita currently exceeds that of any other country, and soon the majority of the population will be tested.
This was due to the ability to conduct rapid testing, along with the acquisition from Group 42 and BGI of a laboratory for mass testing of the population (created on the basis of their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the world's first laboratory on such a large scale operating outside of China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of making test kits that go to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; a protocol developed by the United States sanitation and epidemiology centres was not available until January 28, leading to the absence of test kits in the United States.
But in South Korea, experts say, the wide availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, South Korea's government has worked to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
Spain purchased the test kits from China's Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results could be an unsuccessful sample collection or the improper use of the kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would withdraw kits that produce inaccurate results and replace them with other kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of test kits the Czech Republic purchased in China produced incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed dumping them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that test kits purchased in China had a "high level of errors" and the Ministry "did not use them." Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that the kits were unusable.
Quarantine measures for those whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring people who were contacted by such patients, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where a COVID-19 man died for the first time in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, at intervals of about ten days.
About half of those with a positive result had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were quarantined.
Entry into the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much less intense than in other developed countries and has not had to impose such extreme restrictions as forced closures of restaurants and shops.
Many activities there were cancelled and, on 28 March, Singapore began urging residents to stay home, but schools that ended their holidays on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
Statistical research showed that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries managed to identify more patients with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results of COVID-19 tests to one of WHO's 16 control laboratories for confirmation testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the indicators of the "% positive results" column depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result as a percentage compared to a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, all other things being equal.
The rapidly growing rate of cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in the UK between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union / European Economic Area and in the UK, thus confirming that, despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will require treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in the city of Wuhan in the Chinese province of Hubei.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the infection is a new type of coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been referred to as a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to available data to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 develop the disease in a mild form, i.e. in the form of airway infection with or without pneumonia, with the majority of patients recovering.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% take a critical form when intensive care is required.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK and compares them with trends in China's Hubei province.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria by which the WHO determines the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on January 24, 2020 - all three patients returned from Wuhan, China's Hubei province.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 infection have been identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatalities, are in Italy alone.
Determination of the cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. data on the number of recorded COVID-19 cases in each country of the world, obtained from official sources such as these countries' ministries of health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO.
This data is used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data from Italy.
The truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in 14 days, taking into account the normal COVID-19 flow in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from January 1 to March 15, 2020, was calculated as an indicator of the level of the spread of active cases of COVID-19.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as of 8:00 on March 15, 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK
Trends in the development of the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK were broadly in line with trends observed in China's Hubei province (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to rise around February 21, and on February 28, 2020, there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid rise in the number of reported cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK there were similar trends in the growth of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the UK compared to a similar figure for Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
According to these figures, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid rise in the number of recorded COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
Observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for case recognition and different patient selection rules for COVID-19 testing, including "over-the-top" testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions are already as full as possible.
Currently, data on the admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (the data are not presented).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such information in order to supplement current observational data, which is subject to the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant dispersion in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The ECDC's sixth updated report on COVID-19 rapid risk assessment results presents scenarios for simulating resource utilization of health systems with estimates for hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of shortages of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped into specific regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to be provided as far as possible in Tier 2 Nomenclature of Territorial Units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must therefore be prepared for a long-term SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario and an increase in COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen in affected regions of Italy, for example.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, the rapid, proactive and integrated approach to curbing the spread of SARS-COV-2, followed by a shift from deterrence to minimisation of consequences, is essential because, given the projected rapid rise in the number of diseases, decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to think about, take and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the results of the rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures designed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
Failing this, in the coming days or weeks health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive care.
The zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoV) cause a mild illness such as a common cold.
Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome II (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China at the end of 2019 once again drew attention to the coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission but less pronounced pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.
A human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origins will be very helpful.
Most human coronaviruses are descended from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate storage tanks for some human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of carrier animals has a direct impact on preventing the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interactions of coronavirus-carrying animals can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origins and modes of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of envelope viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses, with the largest genome of RNA viruses containing between 26,000 and 32,000 nucleotides, are named for their shape, which, when examined under an electron microscope, resembles a corona.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyprotein replicates of pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are then recycled to generate 16 unstructured proteins, designated nsp1x16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spine protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of line-specific accesor proteins are also encoded in other coronavirus lines.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronaviruses), with the betacoronavirus species comprising the majority of human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and betacoronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently overcome interspecies barriers, and some have evolved into human-threatening pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include the human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARD) and exhibiting extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first strand of the human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of nasopharynx-separated patients who contracted a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge of the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), there was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was considered generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history, affecting more than 8,000 people and bringing the total death toll to around 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long-running epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019, which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
An alarm has been received and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonotic origin, sourced from bats, mice or pets.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to which viruses have adapted well and in which they show no pathogenic properties, but show wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge to China and the world.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will make it possible to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecies transport.
It may also prompt or speed up the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is essential to prevent the disease from re-spreading in the future.
This review contains general information about the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we designate and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are not usually pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We are also analyzing the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of nasopharynx-separated patients contracting colds, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 informatively and graphically presents a brief history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus came from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract lesions in 1966; the virus subsequently adapted to reproduction in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general ailment and sore throats, with fever and coughing occurring in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of suckling mice.
Clinical signs of infection with the HCoV-OC43 virus look similar to those of the HCoV-229E virus, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are widespread around the world and are usually transmitted in winter at moderate latitudes.
Basically, the incubation period of the two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately a two-week illness.
According to the results of a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the SARS-CoV epidemic, was the first well-documented pandemic in human history caused by the human coronavirus, and the disease was caused by the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the human coronaviruses identified.
The first case of SARS was identified at the end of 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and across continents.
Without taking into account overactive distributors, it was estimated that each diseased person could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days, and the peak viral load occurred on day 10 of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially developed muscle pain, headaches, fever, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough and respiratory failure.
The common deviations of laboratory indicators from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, disorders in liver samples, and elevated levels of creatin kinase.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased levels of macrophages.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, other organs, including gastrointestinal organs, liver and kidneys, can also be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tract, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can prove lethal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open biopsy of the lungs of a relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to research human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was determined that it mainly affects young children, the elderly and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by symptoms such as runny nose, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory illnesses, with the peak of the illnesses it causes occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong that same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to hospital-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been linked to the exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory diseases, was detected worldwide.
All of these four human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation, which entails highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although incidents have been and their causes are unknown, as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, by gaining the ability to be effectively transmitted and preserved in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
Coronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have taken place in the Middle East, but various European countries and Tunisia have recorded imported cases and spread through occasional secondary cases of contamination through close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
Between mid- to late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, China's Hubei province, which is now being linked, in retrospect, to an infection caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed "Coronavirus Infection 19" (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, there have been 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in China's Hubei province is 4.2%, and outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by rising temperatures, coughing and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly turn into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has more transmission capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection have been recorded, which indicates the ability of this virus to spread rapidly around the world.
As a result of comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, important similarities and differences are revealed.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and duration to the diseases they cause.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits the same tendency as the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly seen in human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be distinguished, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, interesting patterns are also noted, characteristic of both human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e., the infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in cala samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human transition.
All four human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it may be that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses, which cause serious diseases in humans, and people in whom human coronaviruses cause serious diseases, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body sufficiently for an accumulation of adaptive mutations to counteract carrier restriction factors to occur.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission among people will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For years, four out-of-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing common colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reserve animal.
The highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses have not adapted well enough to humans and their transmission among humans cannot be maintained.
They need to persist and multiply in their zoonotic tanks and look for cases of susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four non-hospital HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted like HCoV out-of-hospital, at least for the time being.
But it is more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate in a human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate host animal.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV viruses, it would be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying, and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it tolerates a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the reservoir carrier constantly carries HCoV over time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into an intermediate medium just before or around the time it was introduced to humans, it was not well adapted to the new medium and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as a reinforcing carrier, allowing the virus to replicate quickly and then transmit it to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can tolerate a dead-end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate medium and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate medium becomes a natural reservoir medium.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals (game).
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus compared to the general population.
Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civets in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms that did not reach the markets, in most cases SARS-CoV was not determined, which suggests that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate amplifying medium, and not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that numerous species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplifying carriers.
All of them seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for a natural carrier animal, SARS-CoV, identified a closely related CoV of bats, which has been described as associated with atypical pneumonia by the horseshoe bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundations of the new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none other than one, which is designated WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
It is known that the SARS-CoV receptor is a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from a sample of bat feces, has been shown to use ACE2 bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
Curiously, serums from convalescent SARS patients could neutralise WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is generally considered not to be the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis places MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyl dipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to infiltrate viruses.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to sequences from bat betacoronaviruses identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats coincides by only 87%.
That is to say, bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-breasted camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of single-headed camels, further confirming the role of camels as the true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV exhibited minor symptoms, but a massive viral release.
It is noteworthy that infected camels secreted the virus not only in a respiratory way, but also in a fecal-oral way, which is also the main way to secrete the virus in bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome had no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms and are plausibly attributed to human-to-human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that carry MERS-CoV.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides by 96.2% coincides with CoV RaTG13 bats isolated from the Asian horseshoe Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute parental relationships to them.
That is to say, bats may not be the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical coronaviruses of bats are found in the future.
Presumably, the direct carrier animals of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, with which many initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, which indicates a probable case of transmission from the animal to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also have tolerated the parent betacoronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes is 85-92% identical to SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with nucleotide sequence identity at around 90%.
They cluster into two authentic differentiation viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RBD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with amino acid sequence identity at 97.4%.
Quite the opposite, RSD strains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported identifying viral contigs in lung samples that appeared similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of assembling and manual processing were used to produce a genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It cannot be ruled out that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carrier animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin betacoronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology across the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal advocates recombination between the pangolin betacoronavirus, which is related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of the HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may come from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and found in the North American tricolor sucker, has been reported to show a close relationship to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that its intermediate host may also have been camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origins of known coronaviruses is summarised in Figure 1 and in Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for the events of interspecies transmission of HCoV in the history.
When the interspecies transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred around 1890 and people became infected from pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of the interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Bat alphacoronaviruses, closely related to HCoV-229E, have been found.
Between them is the alphacoronavirus alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could make contact with bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alphacoronaviruses of bats, related to HCoV-229E, in bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while the alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavirus alpaca was not found in wild animals.
As such, it cannot be ruled out that the alpacas received an alphacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it's no surprise that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses could serve as the gene pool for the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and single-breasted camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves as a perfect example of interspecies transmission from bats to single-breasted camels and from single-breasted camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its initial identification and has since been confirmed by subsequent studies.
Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies gene fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interactions and the ability to fly make bats "perfect spreaders."
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single-breasted camels decades ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate medium into a stable and natural reservoir medium.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.
Its episodic transmission to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dead-end carrier of MERS-CoV, since its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, pangolin betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be dead-end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities of interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an ecological niche with bats by mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, pangolins can be one of the intermediate amplifying media into which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.
People contract the virus through cutting carcasses and eating the meat of wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Third, as noted above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third form, which came into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of carrier animals, three main factors on the part of viruses also contributed to the crossing of interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year in one site 2, depending on the phase of the coronavirus adaptation to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high rate of mutation and weakening or even nonviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog Remdesivir inhibits coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the mutation rate can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-breasted camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly become efficacious as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution favouring the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by the numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3' end of the genome.
Third, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During DNA transcription, the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, often switches threads.
High-homologous full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-carrier interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
This paper cites SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different media, especially in relation to mutations in S protein RSD.
In general, the RSD of the S coronavirus protein interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier antibody response intensively selects it.
In SARS-CoV, RSD is an amino acid, from the 318th to the 510th, on a fragment of S1, which, in order to introduce the virus into the cell, binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2), as well as its coreceptors.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is capable of detecting the ADP2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoon dogs, making it possible for interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD, which differ from human and civet viral strains, 4 of which are in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the spike protein with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of protein S suggests that the binding affinity of protein S to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectron microscope says that the affinity of this link is 10 to 20 times higher than between human APF2 and the SARS-CoV virus S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine if any other coreceptors are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to a different segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsial acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from host animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of carrier dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, single-breasted camels and rodents, could represent a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, HCoV viruses have to usurp dependency factors and subject themselves to carrier restriction factors.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between virus and carrier still need to be identified and categorized.
Impartial genome-wide screening of media dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 with the latest CRISPR technology can produce good results.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The variety of bat coronaviruses creates ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accesor proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but they have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was found in strains isolated at the start of the human epidemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Localizations of recombination have also been identified in nonstructural proteins nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV was shown to have undergone recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-breasted camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely as a result of the virus getting rid of exerted selective pressures, such as from the host immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to double-nucleotide deletion.
While the intact open read frame of ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alphacoronavirus exhibits a single-nucleotide insertion that causes the frame to shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure on their storage media.
Infecting bats with coronaviruses registered mild symptoms or lack thereof, suggesting mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turned out that bats were anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed thanks to the apregulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main histocompatibility complex I class.
Moreover, high levels of active oxygen species, which are provided by high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress replication of the coronavirus, while affecting reading by exoribonuclease, thus creating selection pressure to generate strains of the virus that turn out to be highly pathogenic upon entry into the new host.
More pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
So it is no accident that three new human coronaviruses have emerged over the past twenty years.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate confidently without triggering a strong immune response in the host.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with an overactivation of the immune response and a cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lesion of the lungs.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with coronavirus replication.
The same immune response strategy can have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
In bats, the interferon response is particularly strong.
Therefore, taking type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, NLRP3-inflammasome activation is impaired in bats.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasomes using MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While the bat betacoronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 95% identical to SARS-CoV, has been found, there is also the bat coronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 96% identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civets and other animals in the markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been established.
Pangolin betacoronaviruses, strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, have been found, suggesting that pangolins may have served as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of the genes of pangolin betacoronaviruses may have made it into the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by man.
Coronaviruses have gained widespread attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV reservoir animals in human transmission.
Conclusive evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are descended from bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing game markets and destroying civets on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of various lines of pangolin betacoronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from food markets to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this may occur remains the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-breasted camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in China's wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels, combined with other infectious controls.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause outbreaks of the disease.
Various zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating around the world.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans.
To reduce unnecessary human-animal contact, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.
After rigorous tests, such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and a plan for responding to such situations are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the opportunity arises to seize new territories.
Although many of the properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, by teaching people to stay away from them, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, ongoing epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future disease outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
In the zoonotic puzzle, SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.
First, if bats transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, then it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true mediator, then it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor viruses are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
