The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, help track close contacts, and identify individuals who may have been in contact with infected persons ("contacts").
Some regions and jurisdictions have developed or proposed many applications with the support of the official government.
Many frameworks for building close contact tracking applications have been established.
Privacy issues have also attracted attention from many parties, especially some systems need to track the geographic location of application users.
Less invasive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the distance between the user and other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the integration of this Bluetooth-enabled function directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government and Alipay have jointly developed an application to support citizens to check whether they have been exposed to COVID-19 patients.
The program is currently used in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community, released as open source software, and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based application "StopKorona!" to track the exposure of potentially infected people and help medical institutions respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication Technology and the Ministry of Health of Northern Macedonia.
As of April 14, 2020, the application is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the close contact tracking application has entered the advanced stage of development and will be put into use in the next few weeks. Ireland and France also plan to launch similar applications ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geo-fencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, cited some practical problems with application systems, including false positives and false positives, and if only a small percentage of people use the application, it may lack effectiveness.
To prevent the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple has set restrictions on the types of organizations that can publish coronavirus-related applications in the Apple App Store, which is limited to "official" or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists say they are concerned about large-scale surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure built in response to the coronavirus epidemic should be dismantled after the threat of the epidemic is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations announced eight conditions to be met for government projects:
Surveillance must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The monitoring and surveillance extension must have a "sunset" clause;
The data collected is limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected, and there is evidence that it is actually protected;
Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with third parties should be defined according to law;
Must provide safeguards to prevent data abuse and provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse;
All "relevant stakeholders" are required to "effectively participate," including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan aims to solve the problem of continuous monitoring and remove it from the device's operating system once tracking is no longer needed.
Some countries have adopted location tracking based on the network rather than the application, users do not need to download the application, and also avoid being tracked.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that can access the original location data may have serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only use the central server to communicate with each other have now been created (see below for details).
South Korea has launched a system that is not based on applications to perform contact tracking tasks.
The system does not use a special application, but chooses to collect tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combines this information to send notifications to potential infected people via SMS.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the government was also allowed to disclose location information because the country has made significant adjustments to the information privacy law after the outbreak of MERS.
The public can obtain this information through many applications and websites. Other countries (including Germany) are considering using both centralized systems and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, no specific details have been announced.
Privacy protection Close contact tracking is a well-recognized concept, and a large number of relevant research literature dates back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy protection solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordination scheme that includes centralized and decentralized methods, not a single protocol. The decentralized agreement includes decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, formerly known as contact event number, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocol, and mobile contact tracking mechanism (PACT).
According to these protocols, personally identifiable data will never leave the device, and all matching is done on the device.
The privacy team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the research content of the white paper "Rogue Application: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. In addition to this, Enigma MPC, a company originally founded in the MIT Media Lab and dedicated to the development of privacy technologies, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, some groups formed a global TCN alliance around basically the same methods and basically overlapping agreements. The goal is to reduce fragmented information and support global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications. This is achieved A key to wide application.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that its official government application uses the open source BlueTrace protocol.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which respectively control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a close contact tracking program, claiming that the plan combines Bluetooth low energy technology with privacy protection encryption technology to protect privacy The role.
In addition, they also announced the core technical specifications used in the system.
Apple and Google said the system is planned to be launched in three stages:
Launched some tools to support the government to create an official coronavirus tracking application that protects privacy
Integrating this function directly into iOS and Android systems, Google and Apple plan to launch the system through operating system updates first, and the system will be deleted in the same way after the outbreak threat to solve subsequent monitoring problems.
Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is the act of cleaning hands to remove dust, grease, microorganisms, or other useless substances from the hands.
Insist on washing your hands with soap at certain "critical moments" every day to prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which can be spread through the fecal-oral route.
If people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, mucous membranes), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or the common cold.
Five key moments of washing hands with soap during the day: before and after bowel movements, after cleaning the child's buttocks or after changing diapers, before feeding the child, before meals, before and after handling food, or before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have soap and water, you can clean your hands with grass ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following situations:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Take care of patients before and after.
After changing diapers or cleaning the hips of a child in the toilet.
After wiping your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food or animal feces.
Medical staff hand hygiene refers to the hygiene habits related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before issuing medicine or performing medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that may harm the human body or cause disease.
For people engaged in food processing or working in the medical field, hand washing is particularly important, but for the public, hand washing is also very important.
There are many health benefits of hand washing, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And to reduce the infant mortality rate at home delivery.
A 2013 study showed that improving hand-washing habits slightly promoted the height increase of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, by promoting simple behavior changes (for example, washing hands with soap), child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced.
This simple behavior can reduce the mortality of the above diseases by nearly 50%.
Advocating hand-washing as an intervention can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about one-third, and its effect is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap can reduce diarrhea by 48%. As a spontaneous act in homes, schools and communities around the world, washing hands with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
As a major acute respiratory infection, pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children under five years of age. Pneumonia kills approximately 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
UNICEF says that compared with any single vaccine or medical intervention, making hands washed with soap before meals and after going to the toilet can become a deep-rooted habit that can save more lives and can reduce deaths caused by diarrhea by nearly half. The death from acute respiratory infections is reduced by a quarter.
As part of the Water Supply, Sanitation and Personal Hygiene (WASH) project, other hygiene interventions are usually taken while advocating hand washing.
Washing your hands can also prevent pustulosis, which is spread through direct physical contact.
Washing your hands will have a slight adverse effect, that is, frequent hand washing will cause dry skin and cause skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy and chapped skin, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Excessive and frequent hand washing is also considered as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
In order to reduce the fecal-oral spread of the disease, there are five key moments of washing hands with soap during the day: after going to the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning the child's buttocks (changing the diaper), before feeding the child, before meals and handling Before and after food or after handling raw meat, fish or raw poultry.
To prevent the spread of disease, you should also wash your hands in the correct way in the following situations: before and after handling incisions or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or wiping your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that 38.7% of households used soap to wash their hands. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest proportion at 97%; the United States was close to the average at 77%; China had the lowest at 23%. Now, in order to advocate the act of washing hands with soap at critical moments, a number of ways to change behavior have been implemented. In order to help children develop hand-washing habits, developing countries can choose to allow school children to wash their hands at designated locations every day.
The "Basic Health Care Plan" promoted by the Philippine Ministry of Education is a model for large-scale initiatives to improve children's health and education.
The core of this national plan is deworming twice a year, supplemented by daily hand washing with soap and brushing with fluoride toothpaste.
In Indonesia, this plan has also been successfully implemented.
Soap or detergent in the water can better remove microbes from the skin.
The main role of soaps and detergents is to reduce dissolution barriers and increase solubility.
The use of water alone cannot effectively cleanse the skin because fat and protein (parts of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.
However, cleaning and washing hands requires reasonable water...
Because solid soap can be reused, it may retain the bacteria left over from previous use.
A small number of studies have investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap, and concluded that bacteria cannot be transferred because they are washed away by foam.
However, CDC still claims that "it is best to use non-contact liquid soap".
Antibacterial soap has been vigorously promoted among health-conscious people.
So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in nature have been selected using the recommended antibacterial agents or disinfectants.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antimicrobial agents such as triclosan, which has a large number of resistant microorganism strains.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soaps are not selected for antibiotic resistant strains, antibacterial soaps may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to surfactants and skin care agents, complex formulas may also contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antibacterial active benzoic acid as pH adjusters, and more skin conditioners (aloe, vitamins, menthol, Plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health at the University of Oregon showed that ordinary soaps have the same effect as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from hands.
Washing hands with hot water is comfortable, but its heat is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow quickly at body temperature (37 Â°C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microbes on the hands, which is contrary to popular belief.
Non-water-based hand sanitizers or disposable anti-bacterial hand sanitizers are non-aqueous hand cleaners.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, non-aqueous alcohol-based hand cleansers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disposable antiseptic hand rubs, or disposable hand sanitizers) were very popular.
Most of the formulas of these hand sanitizers contain isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, and then add a thickener such as carbomer (acrylic polymer) to form a gel, or add a humectant such as glycerin to form a liquid, or form a foam for easy use. And relieve dry skin caused by alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide can further increase antibacterial activity. Disposable hand sanitizer containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol is effective for sterilization.
Alcohol hand rub can kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory tract) Syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
After 30 seconds of alcohol hand rubbing liquid with 70% alcohol content, it can kill 99.97% of bacteria on the hand (reduced by 3.5 orders of magnitude, which is similar to a reduction of 35 decibels). After 1 minute of hand rubbing, it can reduce 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude) bacteria. No-clean hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria, but less effective for some viruses.
Alcohol hand rubbing liquid has almost no effect on viruses such as norovirus (also known as Norwalk) (the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis). You must use enough disposable antiseptic hand sanitizer or alcohol hand rub to thoroughly wet or cover your hands.
Scrub the palms and back of the hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
Fingertips must also be washed thoroughly, rubbing the fingertips on both palms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands rather than using disposable hand rubs, especially if your hands look dirty.
Because such hand rubs are easy to use and can quickly deactivate microorganisms, they are increasingly used; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-free, hand-washing liquids can cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
Glycerin and/or other emollients can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate dry skin caused by alcohol.
In clinical trials, compared with soap or antibacterial cleansers, alcohol-free hand-washing liquid containing emollients can significantly reduce the occurrence of skin irritation and dry skin.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or allergies to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rub are rare.
Compared with washing hands with soap and water, alcohol-free hand-washing liquid is less likely to induce irritant contact dermatitis, which is one of the reasons for its attractiveness.
Although anhydrous detergents are effective, they do not remove organic matter from your hands, but only disinfect them.
Therefore, the no-clean hand sanitizer is less effective than soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, because these pathogens are still on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free leave-on hand sanitizer depends largely on the ingredients and formulations, and its effect has always been much worse than that of alcohol and alcohol hand rub.
Recently, the formulation using benzalkonium chloride has been proven to have sustained and cumulative antibacterial activity after use. This is different from alcohol. Alcohol has been shown to reduce the effect after repeated use, which may be due to the gradually causing adverse Skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use grass ash or soil instead.
Plant ash or soil is worse than washing hands with water alone, but not as good as soap.
One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may accelerate the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, grass ash is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it meets water.
WHO recommends that if there is no soap available, you can use plant ash or sand instead of soap.
The steps recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of disease are the following:
Wet your hands with running warm or cold water.
The use of running water is recommended because the vertical basin may be contaminated, and the water temperature does not seem to matter much.
Use a sufficient amount of soap to scrub repeatedly to produce foam, and at the same time wash the back of the hand, between fingers and between the nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin. Studies have shown that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of washing their hands with water alone.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing generates friction, which helps remove bacteria from the skin. The longer the scrubbing time, the more bacteria are removed.
Wash thoroughly with running water.
Washing hands with a basin will cause recontamination.
Wipe dry with a clean towel or dry naturally.
Wet hands are more likely to be recontaminated. The area between the thumb, wrist, finger, and nail seam are the most often overlooked areas.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may hide microorganisms.
It is generally recommended to use moisturizing lotions to avoid dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection transmission.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available in developing countries, various low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, for example, pouring water through a hanging bucket or perforated gourd, and/or washing hands with grass and ash (if necessary) ). In the case of limited water supply (for example, schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving hand-washing schemes can be used, such as simple faucets and other low-cost methods.
The technology of the simple faucet is very simple. Hang a jug with a rope, then pour a small amount of water on the hand through a foot pedal, and then use soap.
Drying hands effectively is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there is still some debate about the most effective way to dry hands in public toilets.
More and more research shows that paper towels are more hygienic than electric dryers provided in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium of the tissue industry. The research on paper towels, warm air dryers and more modern jet dryers is The degree is compared.
After washing your hands, use a warm air dryer to dry your hands. The average amount of bacteria on your fingers increased by 194%, and the total amount of bacteria on your palms increased by 254%.
In the case of dry hands with a jet dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42%, and the total amount of bacteria on the palms increased by an average of 15%.
After washing your hands, dry your hands with paper towels, the average amount of bacteria on your fingers is reduced by 76%, and the total amount of palms is 77%. Scientists have also conducted various tests to determine whether various hand-drying methods may cause cross-infection in other toilet users and toilet facilities.
It is said that the jet dryer sprays air at 180 meters/second (650 kilometers/hour; 400 miles per hour), which can blow away the microorganisms on the hands and the body, which may contaminate other toilets within 2 meters. And toilet facilities.
Use a warm air dryer to spread microorganisms 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
The results of using paper towels to dry hands show that there is no serious microbial transmission. In 2005, TÃV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate different ways of doing hands.
After drying hands, the following changes in the number of bacteria were observed:
The study involved many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and compared these hand dryers with paper towels.
During travel, in the absence of soap and water, you can choose to use hand disinfection wipes to wash your hands.
The alcohol content of alcohol-free hand sanitizer should be at least 60%.
Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis) discovered in 1846 that hand washing can effectively prevent the spread of disease in the hospital. However, it was only after a long time before medical staff were forced to wash their hands.
The hospital uses electronic devices that can provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that the infection rate decreased after using these devices.
Medical personnel should wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, and use sufficient soap and water or gel to wash the hands to create foam and rub all parts of the hands.
Rub your fingers together.
If there is debris between the nails, you can use a hard brush to remove it.
Since the remaining water on the hands may still contain bacteria, it must be washed thoroughly and wiped dry with a clean towel.
After drying, use a paper towel to close the faucet (if necessary, use a paper towel to open the exit door).
This prevents contamination of the hands due to contact with these surfaces.
In medical and health institutions, the purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid spread.
A report in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that in most medical settings, hand washing still does not reach an acceptable level, and a large number of medical staff often forget to wash their hands before contacting patients, resulting in the spread of microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infection rates by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a worksheet demonstrating standard hand washing and rubbing methods in medical institutions.
The organization also posted a draft hand hygiene guide on its website for public comment.
Whitby et al. conducted a related review.
If you need to verify regulatory compliance, then commercial equipment can be measured and verified by hand hygiene.
The "five moments" recommended by the World Health Organization:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before aseptic operation and
After taking care of the patient. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap ("medicinal soap" or "antibacterial soap") can produce hand sanitizers.
This sterilization procedure may be required before surgery or in an environment with a large number of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. When "scrubbing" hands for surgery, there must be a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching, a hand sanitizer containing chlorhexidine or iodine, a sterile towel used to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing And other sterile tools for cleaning nail seams.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands, forearms and elbows, usually for 2â6 minutes.
There is no need to scrub for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, the water on the forearm must be prevented from flowing back to the hand.
After washing your hands, use a sterile cloth to dry your hands and put on your surgical gown.
In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, it is best to wash your hands before or after contacting the patient or use no-clean sterilizing hand sanitizer.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning comes from when the frequency of hand washing reaches 20%. When the frequency of hand cleaning increases to more than 35%, further benefits are extremely limited.
Compared with the use of antibacterial soaps, washing hands with ordinary soaps will result in a three-fold increase in the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food. Comparing hand rubbing with alcohol hand rub and hand washing with antibacterial soap (30 seconds each), the percentage of bacterial infections using alcohol hand rub was 26% lower than that of antibacterial soap.
However, to reduce the H1N1 influenza A virus (H1N1 influenza A) virus and Clostridium difficile spores (Clostridium difficile spores), soap and water are more effective than alcohol hand rub. Interventions such as training employees on how to wash their hands, increasing the supply of alcohol hand rubbing liquid, and giving written and oral reminders to employees can improve hand hygiene in medical institutions.
For which interventions are most effective in various medical settings, further research is needed.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered a cost-effective tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, people's homes, schools, and workplaces lack reliable water supplies, soap, or hand-washing facilities, which makes popularizing hand-washing practices a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there is a cheap way to build a hand-washing station, it is still very rare to have a hand-washing faucet near each private toilet or public toilet.
However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be due to deep-rooted habits, not because of a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating the use of soap for hand washing can influence policy formulation, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioral changes for residents.
To be effective, it must be monitored and evaluated.
A systematic evaluation of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective in increasing the proportion of hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), while social marketing activities are less effective. An example of advocating hand washing in schools is the "Samsung Method" promoted by UNICEF. Among other hygiene requirements, schools are encouraged to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can rise from one star to the highest three stars.
Hand washing promotion activities may include the construction of hand washing stations to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of raising hand-washing awareness activities is World Handwashing Day, which aims to try to achieve behavioral changes. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing and DALY in developing countries.
However, there are reports showing that the cost-effectiveness of advocating hand washing with soap is more significant than other water and sanitation interventions.
The earliest recognized the importance of hand washing for human health-especially for those who are weak (for example, a mother in a hospital just after giving birth or an injured soldier), were two pioneers in the field of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by a stench called malaria.
The outbreak of foodborne diseases and iatrogenic infections in the 1980s prompted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene, emphasizing that hand hygiene is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters of "correct hand washing methods" will be hung next to the sinks in public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets.
The idiom "wash your hands and do nothing" means that someone declares that they are unwilling to take responsibility or participate in something.
It is derived from the content of the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible. Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus, and later evolved into a widely used idiom in some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare's "Macbeth", Mrs. Macbeth began to force her hands to wash her imaginary stains, indicating that she felt guilty about the crimes she committed and her husband's crimes.
Research shows that people who think of or conceive of unethical behavior tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to cherish hand-washing facilities more often.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after envisaging unethical behavior are unlikely to engage in other "purifying" compensation actions, such as volunteering.
Religion requires washing hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand-washing with water but no soap when washing hands is part of the iconic hand-washing ceremony of many religions, including bathing (tevilah) and hand-washing (netilat yadayim) cleansing rituals in the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity. Hand washing and small nets in Islam. Religion also has hygienic handwashing regulations, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after going to the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after meals.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths, Causing a huge human disaster.
Similar to its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to become infected with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
Although the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than SARS, it is more spreadable, affecting more elderly people than young people and more men than women.
In view of the rapid increase in publications related to New Coronary Pneumonia, this article intends to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly developing research topic.
We will introduce basic knowledge about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory of the Chinese people. The outbreak of a new viral disease forced everyone to stay at home throughout the holidays and the subsequent weeks.
This virus has a high degree of homology with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV on February 11, 2020 -2, related diseases are called Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country, then spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 has become the "number one public enemy", and the threat may exceed terrorism.
According to data from PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months have passed since the first report of the isolation of viral sequences from multiple patients on January 7, 2020 More than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published, covering virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment.
This article aims to summarize the research progress in this emerging discipline.
People are used to comparing COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some urgent issues that have yet to be resolved.
In the past, CoV has been considered to be a non-fatal pathogen in humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds4.
But this century has encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which broke out in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries. Prevalence and mortality.
Therefore, the COVID-19 epidemic is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, Wuhan City first reported multiple unexplained cases of pneumonia to the China National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was announced.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
At the same time, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, the medical staff reported an infection, suggesting that there may be person-to-person transmission.
On January 23, Wuhan closed its city and closed all public transportation.
On January 24, the first clinical study on new coronary pneumonia reported that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan South China Seafood Market, which is considered the starting point for infections of unknown animal origin.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency."
As of the publication of this report, the disease has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2 (Fig. 2)).
Due to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and severity of the outbreak have yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided updated instructions for this epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin. qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages, but the main age group is 30-65 years old.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons are over 50 years old, very few are under 20 years old, and only 14 infected persons are under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more males (0.31 per 100,000) than females (0.27 per 100,000).
COVID-19 mainly spreads in Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic regeneration number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincided with the large-scale population migration time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (â¥60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large family of enveloped viruses containing single-sense strand RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely Î±, Î², Î³, and Î´, of which Î±-CoV and Î²-CoV are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV binds to its cell receptors angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is replicated, the genomic RNA, together with the envelope glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein, form a vesicle containing the virion, and then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of Î²-CoV. From 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, where the outbreak occurred, the genetic identity was over 99.98%.
Compared with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultrathin sections of human airway epithelium.
The study found that human ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, compared with SARS-CoV, the binding of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 is weak, which is consistent with the fact that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than that of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNÎ²; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of a full-length human ACE2 complexed with amino acid transporter B0AT1 with a resolution of 2.9 Ã.
They found that the complex has an open and closed conformation and is assembled into a dimer. The ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, thus providing evidence of CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
As we all know, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and spread to humans through civet and camel, respectively.
By comparing the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the natural host of SARS-CoV-2, because this new virus and the two SARS-like CoVs from bats are named bat-SL- CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21-with 96% consistency.
However, it is unclear what intermediate host helps the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans, and its transmission route remains to be elucidated.
Ji et al. proposed that snakes are virus carriers from bats to humans, which involves homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China believe that, in view of a pangolin, a long-nosed anteater often used in Chinese medicine, a CoV found to be 99% genetically homologous to SARS-CoV-2 Therefore, pangolins are considered as potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a huge difference; therefore, specific evidence is still needed to provide decisive results (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment, and can survive up to 5 days at 20 Â°C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
According to reports, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat-56 Â°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents can effectively inactivate viruses, but chlorine It has been determined that it cannot effectively inactivate viruses.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so they are susceptible to this new virus.
At present, there is no detailed research report on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).4).
Generally speaking, after the virus invades the host, it will first be recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors ( NLR) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Viruses induce inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis through different pathways. They limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus get rid of the immune response.
The adaptive immune response will soon join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected by the virus.
Helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help these defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including complementâsuch as C3a and C5aâand antibodies is also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients can neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system produces a large amount of free radicals locally, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, can lead to multiple organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by clustered disease, is more likely to affect the elderly and pregnant women with multiple comorbidities.
Usually, individuals exposed to large amounts of viruses or immunocompromised individuals are more likely to develop infections than others.
According to a study conducted on the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 1-14 days, and most of them were 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and the range was 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that based on the demographics of 8,866 cases, the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health department, it is very important to adjust the effective isolation time according to the most accurate incubation period, so as to prevent the asymptomatic infected person from spreading the virus to others.
As a general rule, people who are in contact with or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and first symptom of COVID-19. It may be free of any other symptoms and may be accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset.
In severe cases, it will rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Even if there are no pulmonary imaging abnormalities, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for viruses for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of various symptoms was: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55%, diarrhea 3%; 8% of patients need ventilation support.
Two recent studies on the incidence of family aggregation and asymptomatic individual transmission leading to aggregation incidence reported similar results.
In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of these patients require ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with the higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13 -25%) ) Is the main symptom, about 14%-20% of patients need ventilation support.
As of February 14, there have been 66,576 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, with a mortality rate of 2%.
In contrast, as of November 2002, the mortality rate of SARS in 8,096 confirmed cases was 10%.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An early study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 lists the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0.
The above data shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher diffusion capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but lethality is lower than the latter two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clustered onset usually occurs in the same family, or from the same party or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other epidemic areas within the last two weeks before onset, or have a history of close contact with infected persons or patients.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, thereby alerting them to prolong the isolation time.
The number of peripheral blood leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in patients in the early stage of the disease was normal or decreased.
For example, among 1,099 patients with COVID-19, leukopenia and aspartate aminotransferase levels of white blood cell count &lt; 4Ã109/L including lymphocyte count &lt; 1Ã109/L were found Elevated and viremia.
Some patients can see elevated levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients can see elevated blood C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
In severe patients, blood fibrin degradation product D-dimer levels are increased and the lymphocyte count is progressively reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 have abnormal chest imaging, which is characterized by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass shadows of the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis can severely impair gas exchange.
Type I and type II alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction will reduce surfactant levels and increase surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion capacity and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest imaging findings usually appear at the same time as the severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, COVID-19's first pathological analysis revealed alveolar epithelial cell shedding, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease. The pathology of infection and ARDS is consistent and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main diagnostic standard for COVID-19.
However, because the higher false negative rate may accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical manifestations for diagnosis on February 13, 2020 (instead of relying solely on RT-PCR).
A similar situation occurred during the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, combining medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and imaging results is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the team of Zhang Feng reported a scheme for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology. This scheme does not require complicated instruments and can use a piece of test paper in less than an hour Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments with concentrations of only 20 Ã 10-18 mol/L to 200 Ã 10-18 mol/L (10-100 virus copies per microliter) were detected.
If verified in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to greatly improve the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.
Due to the lack of experience in the treatment of new CoV, doctors mainly provide support treatment for patients with COVID-19, while trying to use or propose for other CoVs-such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-and various other viral diseases Therapy (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments, such as antivirals, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It is even recommended to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning, and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the main threats to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including conventional oxygen inhalation, high flow oxygen inhalation, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is well known that overexpression of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS can cause cytokine storms.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IFNÎ±, IFNÎ², IFNÎ³, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is the main reason for ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in critically ill patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive therapies against cytokine storms include: regulation of T cell directed immune responses; blockade of IFN-Î³, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; bonatuzumab; cytokine signaling inhibitor 4; and HDAC Inhibitor.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they may cause serious side effects, especially ischemic osteonecrosis, thus seriously affecting the prognosis.
Nonetheless, it is recommended that patients with severe COVID-19 be cautiously treated with low- and medium-dose corticosteroids for short-term treatment.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it has been found that reduxil, a nucleotide analog, administered intravenously to a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Redoxir is a new type of antiviral drug developed by Gilead. It was originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola virus and Marburg virus.
Later, it was also proved that redoxivir may inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gilead has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, and the results are promising.
In addition, the use of barectinib, alpha-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin has been suggested as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
After combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur.
The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody production in recovered patients
It has a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease.
In fact, patients who have recovered usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies. They recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this principle, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and then injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours. At the same time, they found that inflammation and viral load were reduced, and blood oxygen saturation was increased.
However, before the development of specific therapies, it is necessary to verify and clarify to propose methods that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, considering the therapeutic effect, some disadvantages related to plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a toxic reaction that can be life-threatening.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma requirements for treating critically ill patients are high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, a more critical and practical method is to isolate B cells from the recovered patients and identify the genetic code that encodes an effective antibody, or to screen for effective antibodies against proteins necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily expand the scale of antibody production.
In China, TCM has been used to treat various diseases for thousands of years.
However, its therapeutic effect depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple ingredients in the prescription, and the prescription of disease diagnosis according to TCM theory is different.
Most active ingredients are still unknown or ambiguous because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their optimal combination.
At present, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shufeng Jiedu capsules and Lianhua Qingwen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87% of patients were treated with TCM, among which the highest cure rate of COVID-19 patients was observed, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province only TCM was used in approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients, and the cure rate was the lowest (13%).
However, this is only a rough comparison because many other influencing factors should be included in the assessment, such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Zhang Boli and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with WM and TCM combination treatment.
They found that the time required for recovery of temperature, disappearance of symptoms, and hospitalization in the WM+TCM group was significantly shorter than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (from light to heavy) in the WM+TCM group was significantly lower than in the WM alone group (7.4% vs 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was also lower than in the WM alone group (8.8% vs 39%).
Nonetheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still require higher quality controlled trials, a larger scope, and more centers to confirm.
It will also be of interest to characterize the mechanism of action of TCM therapy or its combination and to clarify its active ingredients when possible.
Most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 will have great fears due to this highly contagious and even fatal disease, and those who are quarantined will also feel depressed, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, and adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.
A series of psychological reactions were reported in the early stages of the SARS outbreak, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitability, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracking and isolation can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, isolation and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected cases, close contacts, and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans for clear communication, and the use of professional electronic equipment and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from animal hosts and infected patients to susceptible hosts, and are often used as a complementary means of antiviral therapy in controlling the outbreak caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has worked hard to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in SARS animal models.
However, prior to initiating clinical studies, the in vivo effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the elderly and lethal attack models and their protective effects on zoonotic virus infections have not been determined.
This is most likely because SARS disappeared as early as 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, due to the continued existence of zoonotic disease in epidemic areas, sporadic cases and clustering of MERS persist in the Middle East and spread to other regions.
Through the use of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the current epidemic.
However, due to the long time required for vaccine development (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in CoV, overcoming this difficulty is challenging.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 severe patients also have a high morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, establishing a prognostic model for this disease is essential for health care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor influencing the prognosis of SARS, as is COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study involving 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurred in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7% of patients were over 50 years old.
Patients who require intensive care are more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and are significantly older than patients who do not require intensive care (median age 66 years vs. 51 years), suggesting a prognosis for patients with COVID-19 age factor.
Gender: As mentioned earlier, there are more men than women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31 per 100,000 versus 0.27 per 100,000).
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
According to reports, SARS-CoV-2 can also be combined with ACE2 positive bile duct cells, which may lead to abnormal liver function in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory test results: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been considered as potential prognostic factors for disease, treatment response, and eventual recovery.
Others have suggested that CRP levels are correlated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Chest imaging examination and time progress of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressive agents and are usually used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffer from ischemic osteonecrosis, leading to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients in small doses and for short periods of time.
Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under great pressure because they often suffered long-term isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of relatives and patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get rid of stress and resume normal life.
Based on the demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or asymptomatic symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, the infected people will produce a lot of viruses in the daily activities in the early stage or incubation period, which brings great difficulties to the control of the epidemic.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV is thought to occur when the patient is seriously ill, and most of the spread does not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, compared with SARS, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more serious and difficult to control.
China is currently making tremendous efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and surrounding cities, and the continued isolation of almost all populations, with a view to interrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused serious damage to China's economy and other areas, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the rate of development of the epidemic is slowing.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. established a model to predict the consequences of the epidemic, and believed that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that patients who recovered and were discharged 2 weeks ago detected SARS-CoV-2 in both middle turbinate and pharyngeal swabs, suggesting that this newly discovered virus may become a periodic epidemic similar to influenza .
However, as the number of new cases has decreased, China has shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.
The Ebola virus has been predicted to cause 1 million cases and cause 500,000 deaths.
However, through strict isolation, the disease was eventually controlled.
Similar to SARS-CoV, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may become weaker and eventually disappear or coexist with the human body as a less pathogenic virus.
The following provides a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be spread by coughing or sneezing, or even by direct contact with objects contaminated by the virus.
This virus has also been found in feces, which increases the possibility of fecal spread.
A recent study involving 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases may have been caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients who previously had other diseases and 40 medical staff.
Therefore, stricter preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, especially medical staff, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have had contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing a mask; using surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) can help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent droplets from potential infections from spreading in the air or adhering to the surface of items that may be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks can prevent the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virions can penetrate completely; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV, both are about 85 nm.
Because viral particles can even penetrate five surgical masks stacked together, medical personnel in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical staff should also wear isolation suits to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also spread through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical personnel should wear transparent masks or goggles when facing patients.
For the public affected by the epidemic or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that everyone use disinfectant soap to wash their hands more frequently than usual, try to stay indoors to isolate themselves, and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new type of virus, based on the profound memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003, the high homology with SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020 should have caused China is highly alert.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention was still appeasing the citizens, saying that the new virus is not very contagious, the possibility of human-to-human transmission is limited, and the epidemic is preventable and controllable.
This news obviously eased the public's vigilance, and as the Spring Festival approached, the key node to contain the epidemic in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies may learn this painful lesson and make major improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more cautious when issuing announcements, because every word is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to abnormal information from hospitals, and Rather than waiting for a formal report from a doctor or official; (3) Strictly control potential outbreaks at an early stage rather than trying to appease the public; and (4) Conduct targeted and effective drills more frequently to increase public awareness of epidemics Recognize and regularly test and improve the social response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 looks like a SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the outbreak and treating patients.
The elderly affected by COVID-19 are more than young people, more men than women, and the severity and mortality of elderly patients are also higher than young patients.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Even if there are no symptoms, COVID-19 patients can still spread the virus, and SARS patients usually only spread the virus when the condition is serious, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This part explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads far more quickly and widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the SARS-CoV-2 routine RNA test may be negative.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured may turn positive again.
These findings greatly increase the risk of virus transmission.
Considering that the research on COVID-19 is so rapid, the following key issues still need to be resolved:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% gene homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal is the intermediate host that spreads the virus from the original hostâassumed to be a batâto humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off the route of transmission, and the outbreak may recur at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Will the virus also bind cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
If there is no clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in the process of passing from person to person?
Will it become a global pandemic? Disappear like SARS? Or will it recur regularly like the flu?
Finding answers to these and many other questions is crucial, but it may take a long time.
However, no matter what the cost is, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although there are no vaccines to complete clinical trials, many attempts to develop this vaccine are still ongoing.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a pathogenic virus, is expected to appear within 18 months.
In April, five candidate vaccines entered the Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
In 2020, a large-scale epidemic spread worldwide, triggering a lot of investment and research activities in vaccine development.
Many organizations are using the published viral genome to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
CEPI proposed a vaccine development plan in April and stated that the top priorities are speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global accessibility.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were researching and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.
The main platform targets to enter Phase I safety research include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developers and candidate vaccines: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5)
CEPI scientists reported in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which have been confirmed as ongoing projects (79 according to Milken Institute data), and another 37 have been announced, But there is almost no public information (presumably planning or designing).
Phase I-II trials carry out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-site trials, while determining a more precise and effective dose.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not been evaluated in humans (still in "preclinical" studies).
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia announced that it is studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that can genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.
Around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of vaccine development with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.

Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a partnership with Novavax Inc.
Development and production of vaccines.
The two organizations further announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that 11 isolates are being studied, and even if the progress is accelerated, it will take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that coronavirus virus-like particles were developed with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health.
Candidate vaccines are under laboratory research and are scheduled to enter human trials in July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump provided CureVac with "a large sum of money" to obtain the exclusive right to use the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a collaboration with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The candidate vaccine based on mRNA, BNT162, is currently in preclinical testing and is expected to begin clinical trials in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that they will obtain preclinical test results in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate may begin human trials in the fall.
On March 19, 2020, in France, the Epidemic Prevention Innovation Alliance (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million to establish a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance consisting of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh , Which brings CEPIâs total investment in COVID-19 vaccine research and development to US$29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners in COVID-19 vaccine development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, The University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days after receiving the viral sequence released by China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a grant of 275 million Canadian dollars to fund 96 medical response research projects for COVID-19, including many candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan programs.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the investment of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, and plans to establish a national "vaccine library" that includes several new vaccines so that when a coronavirus outbreak occurs again, it can be These vaccines are put into use.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the test for PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine that may be used in mice, and called "the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit provided by MNA The vaccine allows [mouse] to produce a powerful antigen-specific antibody response, which begins to appear 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo in Canada announced the design of a DNA-based candidate vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
The researchers used bacteriophages to design DNA to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources and combined cloud computing resources from HP, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to access IBMâs supercomputers.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that in addition to preventing disease, they can bring other benefits.
Further randomized trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health care workers.
The vaccine in development may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines have shown that biosafety level 3 containment measures are required for handling live viruses, and International coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no safe or effective SARS treatment or preventive vaccine for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is a top priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, there is currently no effective vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became popular, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I human clinical trials, and three other vaccines are under development, all of which are viral vector vaccines and two are adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS , BVRS-GamVac), one is the MVA carrier vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Various social media articles have contributed to the conspiracy theory, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that a vaccine is already available.
The patents cited in various social media articles refer to the patents of other existing coronavirus (such as SARS coronavirus) strain gene sequences and vaccines.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of related angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) by reducing the content of angiotensin II and increasing the content of Ang(1-7), and is expected to become a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronaviruses to enter the cell.
The human version of this enzyme is commonly referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal Collectrin kidney amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein whose enzyme active domain is exposed on the cell surface of the lung and other tissues.
Another enzyme called shedding enzyme (sheddase) cleaves the extracellular domain of ACE2 from the transmembrane domain, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood and eventually excreted into urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 attaches to the cell membrane, mainly type II alveolar cells of the lung, intestinal epithelial cells of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells of most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to check and balance ACE.
ACE cleaves angiotensin I into angiotensin II with vasoconstrictor activity.
ACE2 then cleaves the carboxy-terminal amino acid phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to angiotensin with vasodilator activity (1-7 ), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave many other peptides, including desarginine 9 bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 can also regulate the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is related to Hartnup's disease (Hartnup).
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronaviruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (viruses that cause SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (viruses that cause COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bind to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface, leading to endocytosis, which causes the virus and enzyme to translocate into the endosome inside the cell.
This entry process also requires the host serine protease TMPRSS2 to trigger the activation of the S protein, and the inhibition of this process is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic method. Some people speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and regulatory agencies recommend continuing to use standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group."
Moreover, "for patients with a higher risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure, treatment with ACE inhibitors will also reduce the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but the results are not as reliable as reducing the overall risk of pneumonia. "
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered as a new method for the treatment of acute lung injury, and it seems to improve the pulmonary hemodynamic index and blood oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in the human body is about 10 hours, the onset time is 30 minutes, and the course of action (duration) is 24 hours.
Some research results indicate that rhACE2 may be a very useful for patients who are intolerant to classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or diseases with elevated levels of circulating angiotensin II Prospects for drugs. The efficacy of rhACE2 infusion on acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus epidemic is a continuously spreading 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and was listed as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as an epidemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, 210 countries and regions around the world have reported a total of about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19, and about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
The case fatality rate in China is about 4%, while the case fatality rate in various regions of the world is between 0.08% (New Zealand) and 13.04% (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
It may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The incubation period from contact with the patient to onset ranges from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment plan.
Clinical treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. The recommended precautions include washing hands frequently, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a safe distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspected infected persons.
Official agencies of various countries have taken measures such as travel restrictions, isolation, curfews, workplace hazard prevention and control, and facility closures.
The epidemic has caused a severe impact on the global social economy, sports, religious, political and cultural activities have been postponed or cancelled, and panic shopping has exacerbated the widespread supply shortage.
National or local suspension measures have been implemented in 193 countries and regions around the world, affecting about 99.4% of primary and secondary school and college students.
Due to the dissemination of false virus information on the Internet, there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East Asian and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance groups, and groups in severe epidemic areas.
However, reduced travel and heavy industry closures have caused the air pollution index to decrease and carbon emissions to decrease.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China notified a group of cases of unexplained pneumonia and initiated an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the South China seafood wholesale market, so the new coronavirus is considered to be zoonotic.
The virus that caused this outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The earliest discovered patient was later confirmed to have onset on December 1, 2019, and had no obvious connection with a batch of cases in the South China Seafood Market that appeared later.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China seafood market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report that the first case may be traced back to November 17, 2019. The patient is a 55-year-old male from Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, according to the World Health Organization report, the number of newly reported cases in China declined, but the number of newly reported cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea suddenly increased, and the number of new cases outside China exceeded the territory for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially mild cases.
As of February 26, there were relatively few reported cases of adolescents, and the proportion of adolescents aged 19 years and younger globally was only 2.4%. Patrick Valence, the UKâs chief scientific advisor, estimates that approximately 60% of the population in the UK needs to be infected with the new coronavirus in order to be effectively immunized.
The number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and confirmed to be positive according to the official protocol.
As of March 23, the proportion of people in all countries in the world who have been tested has not exceeded 3% of the total population. Many countries have also issued official policies not to detect mild people, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 pointed out that as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infected people in China have not been tested, and these unrecorded infections are the source of infection in 79% of recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, the actual number of infections in Italy far exceeds the number of reported cases.
The basic transmission number (R0) of COVID-19 was originally estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control indicates that R0 may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 can recover.
The time from onset to death for patients who cannot recover is 6-41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 people died of COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China were people over 60 years old, and 75% of deaths were accompanied by underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official statistics of COVID-19 deaths usually refer to patients who died according to the official protocol and tested positive for the new coronavirus.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may far exceed the statistical data, because the data may not include untested patients, such as patients who died at home, nursing homes, etc.
Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times that of the official statistics for the death of the new coronavirus pneumonia.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said frankly: "We know that the [announced death toll] is lower than the actual number," and rumors about the underestimation of US data confirm this statement. Underestimation often occurs in the field of epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. On January 9, 2020, Wuhan saw the first confirmed death in China.
On February 1, the first death case outside China appeared in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first death case outside Asia appeared in France.
As of February 28, outside China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each had more than 10 deaths.
As of March 13, deaths have been reported in more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica. There are several methods commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region and will change over time, and are affected by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time of the first outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health status. The case fatality rate is the number of deaths in a given time period divided by the number of diagnoses.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The case fatality rate is different in different regions.
In China, the estimated case fatality rate has decreased from 17.3% (patients with onset from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (patients with onset after February 1, 2020). Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR). The former reflects the percentage of deaths from disease to the number of diagnoses, and the latter reflects the deaths from disease to the number of infections (including confirmed and undiagnosed) Number of people).
These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process from infection to case resolution for a specific population.
Many scholars try to calculate the above data for a specific group of people.
According to estimates by the Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Center, the overall infection mortality rate for this outbreak is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of the estimated value of this range is in accordance with the first random test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis study on the impact of the test on the estimated value of CFR.
The World Health Organization claims that the outbreak is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and will vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University pointed out: "If left unchecked, infectious disease outbreaks usually enter a stagnation period after existing hosts are exhausted, and then begin to tend to alleviate.
But at present, it is almost impossible to reasonably predict when the inflection point will occur. "
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, believes that if all countries mobilize and adopt the recommendations of the World Health Organization to take measures to stop the spread of the virus, "the end of the epidemic in June can be expected."
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "may be repeated outbreaks for one to two years."
Research led by Neil Ferguson at Imperial College of Technology shows that âbefore the vaccine is put into use (which may take 18 months or more),â it is important to maintain physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said: "This coronavirus is very spreadable, and I think it is unlikely to disappear completely." "It may evolve into a seasonal disease that occurs once a year."
The pathogenicity of the second outbreak depends on the immunity of the population and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (phlegm), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. According to the World Health Organization, about one-sixth of patients will become severe and have difficulty breathing.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists dyspnoea, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips as emergency symptoms; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic and have no clinical manifestations, but the test results are positive, so the researchers recommend close observation and inspection of close contacts of confirmed patients to rule out the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the rate of asymptomatic infections ranges from extremely low to 44%.
The incubation period (the time interval from infection to onset) is generally 1-14 days; 5 days is the most common. Uncertainty can be illustrated by an example: the proportion of COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell was initially estimated to be 30%, and later decreased to 15%.
Some details about the route of transmission of the disease have not yet been determined.
It is currently believed that the disease is mainly spread by close contact and droplets generated when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is within 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) of each other.
The study found that an unobstructed cough may cause droplets to travel as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (15-27 feet).
It has also been suggested that the droplets generated when people are talking and staying in the air for a long time may also cause the virus to spread. Although the virus is usually unable to spread through the air, when people exhale or speak, they may also produce droplets.
Such droplets may fall into the snouts and noses of people around them, or even be sucked into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can nebulize respiratory secretions, which can cause airborne transmission.
In addition, if a person touches the surface contaminated by the virus (including the skin) and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth, it may also cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 fecal spread. This virus is the most infectious in the first three days after onset, but it is also infectious before and after the onset.
A positive result can be detected as early as three days before the onset of illness, which indicates that the new coronavirus is already contagious before showing obvious symptoms.
Although there are few reports of asymptomatic cases diagnosed in the laboratory, some countries have discovered asymptomatic infections during the follow-up investigation of contacts.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet fully clear, generally 1 person can infect 2-3 people. The survival time of the virus on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, it is known that the new coronavirus can live up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and four hours on copper.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature. There have been cases of pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.
There is currently no evidence that animals will reinfect the virus to humans, but the British official agency still recommends that people wash their hands after touching the animals, just like touching other surfaces that may be touched by infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of virus that was first isolated from 3 patients with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature. Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with household soap, because the soap can dissolve the protective capsule of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is currently regarded as zoonotic.
Genetic analysis shows that this coronavirus is genetically clustered with the Î²-coronavirus genus Sarbecovirus subgenus (B cluster) and two bat-derived virus strains.
The new coronavirus and other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) are 96% identical at the genome-wide level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that the virus in the pangolin and the virus in the human body differ by only one amino acid in some parts of the genome sequence.
A genome-wide comparison so far has found that at most 92% of the genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is not enough to prove that the pangolin is an intermediate host.
Whether the virus is infected can be initially diagnosed according to the symptoms, but ultimately it must be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretions.
A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but the specificity is low, and many imaging features will coincide with other pneumonia and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that âCT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease.â
The World Health Organization has announced a number of nucleic acid detection protocols for SARS-CoV-2. The first protocol was released on January 17.
Nucleic acid detection uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for testing.
The results can generally be obtained within hours to days.
In general, this test is performed by nasopharyngeal swabs, but also by pharyngeal swabs. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests for detecting antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these testing methods proved to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use by certified laboratories in emergencies.
Typical X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging features of the onset patient include peripheral ground glass asymmetry and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for the imaging manifestations of confirmed cases.
Due to the coincidence with other viral infections (such as adenovirus), images that have not been confirmed by PCR have limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR results and found that although the image is less specific for identifying infections, the detection speed is faster and more sensitive, so it can be considered as a screening method in popular areas .
At present, a convolutional neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed, which can use X-ray and CT to detect the image characteristics of the virus.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth without washing your hands, covering your mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing, and throwing used tissues directly into the trash.
Suspected infected persons should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.
It is also recommended to take measures to maintain physical distance to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have restricted or recommended avoiding trips to countries and regions affected by the epidemic in non-essential situations.
However, the virus has now reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some community residents have no way of knowing where or how they were infected. Medical personnel who come into contact with suspected infected persons should take standard precautions, exposure precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important means for the health supervision department to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of mobile phone positioning data for tracking purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations such as Amnesty International issued a statement calling for restrictions on such supervision.
At present, there are various mobile applications that have been put into use or entered into proposals for people to use voluntarily. As of April 7, 2020, a total of more than ten expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection functions, such as using Bluetooth to record users and The distance between other phones.
Once the user has had close contact with a patient with a positive COVID-19 test result, they will receive an information reminder. Errors about preventing infection continue to spread; such as rinsing the nose and gargle with mouthwash are ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.
It is recommended to wash hands frequently to prevent the spread of disease.
The US Centers for Disease Control recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when there is obvious dirt on their hands, before meals, and after blowing their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because before the virus enters the human body, it only needs to use household soap to destroy its protective capsule, thereby playing a role in killing the virus.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends that if soap and tap water are not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to wash your hands.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth without washing their hands.
The surface of the object can be disinfected with a variety of solutions (disinfectant can be effective within one minute of the stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 -7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solutions (such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate) are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if a suspected or confirmed case of new coronavirus pneumonia occurs in facilities such as offices or day care centers, all areas should be disinfected, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, and shared electronic equipment such as tablets and touch screens. , Keyboard, remote control, and ATMs used by patients.
WHO recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with curved elbows or tissues when coughing or sneezing, and immediately dispose of all contaminated tissues.
It is recommended that the suspected infected person wear a medical surgical mask because wearing a mask can reduce the amount of droplets exhaled when speaking, sneezing and coughing and shorten the distance of transmission.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on where and how to use the mask.
Virologist Stephen Griffin of the University of Leeds believes: "Wearing masks can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces. Touching the face is also a major source of infection when hand hygiene is not in place." In addition, it is recommended that those responsible for caring for suspected infected persons wear masks.
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people only need to wear masks in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for COVID-19 patients, but the organization also recognizes that wearing masks can help avoid touching your face.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear masks.
The CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China clearly recommends that healthy citizens also wear disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact (within 1 meter (3 feet)) with others.
Hong Kong, China recommends wearing a mask when taking public transportation or entering crowded places.
Thai health officials advise people to make their own masks and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly prohibited from entering public places without wearing masks or covering their mouths and noses.
On March 16, Vietnam required everyone to wear a mask before entering public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government stipulates that everyone must wear a mask when entering the grocery store.
Israel requires that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, China has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March. From April 1, it has been required to wear masks to ride trains and intercity buses.
Panama stipulates that it is necessary to wear masks when going out, and it is recommended that residents who cannot buy masks make their own masks.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infection prevention and control measures related to maintaining social distances (also known as maintaining physical distances) are designed to minimize close contact between people and thereby slow the spread of disease.
Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension of school work, suspension of work, and closure of stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
In terms of maintaining social distance, measures that individuals can take include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to crowded areas, switching to non-contact greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Now, many governments have mandated or recommended that areas affected by the epidemic maintain social distance.
Regarding the size of the largest group of people, US government agencies and health organizations initially recommended 250 people (in areas without COVID-19 transmission), which was quickly reduced to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and groups suffering from basic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and impaired immune system are at higher risk of serious illness and complications. The German Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that such people living in epidemic areas should not go out as much as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began to replace the term âmaintaining social distanceâ with âmaintaining physical distanceâ to clarify that its purpose is to reduce physical contact while still maintaining social contacts, including virtual contacts and Long distance contact.
The use of the term "maintain social distance" implies the requirement that people be completely isolated from society, and does not encourage people to adopt other methods to maintain the connection between people. Some authorities have also issued guidelines on sexual health that apply during the pandemic.
The recommendations included only having sex with partners who lived together and were not infected with the virus or asymptomatic.
It is recommended that COVID-19 diagnosed patients and suspected infected persons be isolated at home.
The health agency has issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended that all residents of the epidemic area should isolate themselves.
In addition, the strictest self-isolation instructions were issued to high-risk groups.
If you have been exposed to patients with COVID-19, or have recently traveled to a country or region that has spread widely, you will be advised to isolate yourself for 14 days from the time you may last be exposed to the virus.
Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment/suppression and mitigation.
Containment applies to the early stages of the outbreak, the purpose is to track and isolate infected people, while taking other infection prevention and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of disease to other groups.
If it is no longer possible to stop the spread of the disease, it is necessary to make an effort to transition to the mitigation phase: take measures to slow the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of the disease on the health system and society.
Containment and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.
Suppression requires more extreme prevention and control measures to reverse the pandemic situation by reducing the basic regeneration number below one. Part of the job of controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is what we know as the leveling of epidemiological curves.
This reduces the risk of collapse of the health service system and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatment options.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing masks, and self-isolation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension of school and cancellation of large-scale assembly activities; aiming to encourage acceptance and participation Community actions of such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning. In the face of a clearly worsened epidemic, China immediately adopted more severe epidemic containment measures, such as the closure of the city and the implementation of strict travel bans.
Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures, and issued an alert on the trajectory of the infected person.
Singapore provides financial support for self-isolated infected persons and imposes huge fines on those who refuse to isolate themselves.
Taiwan, China, has increased the production of masks, and imposed penalties on medical supplies suppliers who cover goods and sell them reluctantly. Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States show that both mitigation (slowing but not preventing the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing the spread of epidemics) face major challenges.
The best mitigation policy may reduce peak medical demand by 2/3 and halve the number of deaths, but it will still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and cause the health system to collapse.
Suppression may be the first measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus stops spreading in the population (or until the vaccine is released, whichever comes first), otherwise once the measures are relaxed, the spread will quickly rebound.
Long-term interventions aimed at curbing pandemics will have social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is still ongoing, including trials of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, fluids, and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the situation.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being investigated to determine whether they are suitable for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also pointed out that some "traditional and home remedies" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization pointed out that improving the treatment capacity and adjusting the medical system to meet the needs of patients with COVID-19 are the basic outbreak response measures.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating selective procedures where possible, separation and isolation COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improve intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There is a lot of speculation about the origin of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of a new coronavirus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019 and is located in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, cases of new coronavirus in Hubei Province gradually increased.
Most of these patients are related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals. One theory is that the new coronavirus originated from one of these animals; or in other words, from zoonotic diseases. On December 26, Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, first discovered and admitted a group of patients with unexplained pneumonia, and reported it to the Jianghan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors in Wuhan Central Hospital reminded their colleagues to be alert to a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were advised by the police for spreading "rumors", while another doctor, Effien, was advised by his superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued an announcement on December 31 and reported it to the World Health Organization.
After receiving numerous reports of unexplained pneumonia cases, the Wuhan health department launched an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases roughly doubled every seven and a half days.
From the beginning of January to mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China under the influence of the Chinese Spring Festival population movement and Wuhan as a transportation hub and major railway hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 newly diagnosed cases in one day, including 2 cases in Beijing and 1 case in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms. As of March 26, the number of confirmed cases in the United States exceeded China and Italy, becoming the country with the most confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million confirmed cases have been reported globally; more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 cures.
Diagnosed cases have been reported in about 200 countries and regions around the world.
Affected by the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have adopted prevention and control measures that restrict the free movement of population and establish border controls.
National-level response measures include containment, such as isolation (also known as home orders, asylum orders or blockades) and curfews. As of April 2, there are nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the total population, in some form of blockade, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are blocked, about 59 million people in South Africa are blocked, and India has 1.3 billion people are blocked.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of blockade, and two days later this number increased to 2.6 billion, accounting for about one-third of the global population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report speculates that the earliest case can be traced back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian discovered a batch of unexplained pneumonia cases on December 26. His hospital reported the situation to the Jianghan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan on December 27.
On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronaviruses were found in preliminary genetic testing of patient samples.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued an announcement on December 31,
Reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.
After these notices were issued, several doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police for the "rumors" of the epidemic of walking.
The China National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no âclear evidenceâ from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical movement. Later, the CPC Central Committee General Secretary Xi Jinping called this a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
On January 23, the government announced that it would pull up an epidemic prevention line in Wuhan, prohibiting people from entering and leaving Wuhan. This epidemic prevention line was later extended to 15 other cities in Hubei. A total of about 57 million people were affected, which is called "the largest isolation in human history." event".
The use of private cars is prohibited in the city.
Many places have also canceled the celebration of the Chinese New Year (January 25).
The government also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Vulcan Hill Hospital, which was completed and delivered within 10 days.
Then another hospital, Raytheon Mountain Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has transformed 14 other venues in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into square cabin hospitals. On January 26, the government took further measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including issuing health declaration forms to travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Colleges and universities across the country have also been suspended.
Hong Kong and Macao in China have also taken a number of measures, especially for primary and secondary schools and colleges.
Many places in China have implemented remote home office measures.
In addition to Hubei Province, travel restrictions are imposed on other identities.
Public transportation has been adjusted, and museums across China have also been temporarily closed.
Many cities have implemented public activity facilities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) are subject to some form of outdoor activity restrictions. After the March epidemic entered the global stage, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "importing" from other countries and regions.
For example, Beijing imposes a 14-day compulsory quarantine on all foreigners entering Beijing. In the 5 days before March 23, there was only one local case in mainland China, which was transmitted by a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of local cases has been basically contained and the epidemic in China has been controlled.
On the same day, other Hubei regions except Wuhan began to relax their travel restrictions two months after the blockade was implemented. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that from March 28, it will suspend the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits. No details have been disclosed regarding when the policy will end.
Those who want to enter China need to apply for a visa to the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encourages enterprises and factories to resume work on March 30 and provides a monetary stimulus plan for enterprises. The State Council announced that April 4 will be designated as a national day of mourning, and a three-minute national silence will be launched at 10:00 on that day. This day coincided with the Ching Ming Festival. The central government advocates that families mourn their loved ones through the Internet to maintain physical distance and avoid the second outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.
On January 20, 2020, South Korea had confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The Korean health agency reported that the number of confirmed cases increased significantly on February 20, which was mainly due to a new religious movement rally held in Daegu, South Korea-the Jesus Church of Xintiandi.
Xintiandi believers from Wuhan to Daegu are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 of 9,336 church members, or about 13%, reported symptoms. South Korea announced on February 23, 2020 that it has entered the highest alert level.
On February 28, South Korea accumulatively reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
The virus test results of three soldiers confirmed to be positive, and since then all South Korean military bases have entered isolation.
The flight schedule has also been adjusted due to the impact of the epidemic. South Korea has launched a virus prevention and control plan that is considered to be the largest and best organized in the world, that is, to screen a large number of people for viruses, isolate all infected persons, and track and isolate close contacts of infected persons.
The screening methods include mandatory requirements for new arrivals from abroad to report symptoms on their own through mobile applications, get off-hook virus testing, get results the next day, and improve testing capabilities, accommodating up to 20,000 people a day for testing.
Although it did not isolate the entire city, South Koreaâs plan is considered to be a successful move for epidemic prevention and control. South Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude towards President Moon Jae-inâs crisis response.
Many South Koreans signed the petition, some called for impeachment and Wen Zaiyin, accusing the government of improper handling of the epidemic, while others praised his response strategy.
On March 23, South Korea reportedly had the lowest total number of new cases in a single day since four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all newly arrived overseas personnel will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus detection assistance from 121 different countries and regions.
On February 19, Iran announced that Qom had the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. Later, according to the Iranian Ministry of Health, two patients had died on the same day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the suspension of universities, higher education institutions, and primary and secondary schools.
Iran allocated 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated that he did not plan to block the affected areas, but would only isolate infected individuals.
In March, Iran announced plans to restrict intercity travel, but intercity traffic congestion continued until the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrine in the Qom region has been open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. In February, Iran became the virus transmission center after China.
Many parties believe that the extent of the outbreak in Iran has been covered up. This includes, as of February 28, the retrospective results of cases in more than ten countries point to Iran, which shows that the actual outbreak in Iran is more serious than the 388 cases reported by the government as of that date. .
The Iranian parliament was forced to close, and it was reported that 23 of its 290 lawmakers tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prisons to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peacefully expressing dissent, and temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The organization pointed out that the risk of virus transmission in closed institutions such as detention centers is greater, and these institutions lack adequate medical care measures.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number of single-day deaths reported by the country since the outbreak.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran has added 50 confirmed cases every hour, and every 10 minutes there will be one new case of death due to coronavirus.
According to World Health Organization officials, the actual number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than reported.
There are also views that US sanctions on Iran may affect the countryâs financial resources in response to the epidemic.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights requested that economic sanctions be eased against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, two Chinese tourists were tested positive in Rome by SARS-CoV-2, and the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy.
The number of cases in the country subsequently rose sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Starting from 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on February 21, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was later discovered. On February 22, the cabinet meeting announced a new decree to curb the spread of the epidemic, including the isolation of more than 50,000 people in 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced: "It is strictly forbidden to enter or leave the affected area.
The epidemic area has ordered work stoppages and suspension of sports events.â On March 4, the Italian government ordered schools at all levels across the country to suspend classes altogether because of 100 domestic deaths.
All major sports events, including the Italian Football League, will be held in an audienceless mode until April, but on March 9, all sports events have been completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian Society of Anesthesia and Analgesic and Critical Medicine (SIAARTI) published medical ethical recommendations on possible triage schemes.
On March 19, Italy reported that 3,405 people died from this pandemic, which surpassed China and became the country with the highest number of deaths from new coronaviruses in the world.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, Italy had a total of 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 cured cases, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
CNN has reported that the dual factors of Italyâs large elderly population and the failure to detect all virus infections so far may be part of the reason for the high mortality rate.
The UKâs initial response to the virus is considered to be the most slack among the affected countries. Until March 18, 2020, the British government began to implement various forms of social distance or large-scale isolation measures for its citizens.
The British government was therefore criticized and accused of lacking speed and strength in responding to public concerns. On March 16, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that any unnecessary travel and social contacts be cancelled, and that people should work at home as much as possible and avoid going to bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure venues including bars and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workersâ wages, with a maximum monthly limit of Â£2,500 to prevent unemployment in the crisis. On March 23, the British Prime Minister announced stricter measures to maintain social distance, prohibiting more than two people from gathering, and no travel or outdoor activities unless absolutely necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the restrictions announced this time are enforced by the police through fines and dispersal of assembly.
Except for businesses that are deemed "essential" in supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and garages, most other businesses have been ordered to stop work.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States was discovered on January 20 in Washington State in the Pacific Northwest. The patient returned from Wuhan on January 15 to the local area.
On January 29, the White House established the Coronavirus Task Force.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed entry restrictions on travelers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control (a major public health agency under the US government) announced that it has developed its own test kits.
Despite this, the United States still has a slow start in detection, masking the true situation of the epidemic at the time.
The kit produced by the federal government in February was defective, and the federal government did not approve the use of non-governmental kits (from academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for testing eligibility were not determined until early March (after which medical advice is required), All these factors have led to the premature detection in the United States being blocked.
On February 27, the Washington Post reported that the total number of tests performed in the United States was less than 4,000.
On March 13, the Atlantic reported that the total number of tests performed by the United States was less than 14,000.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many patients with symptoms and medical orders waited a few hours or days before being tested." On February 29, after the State of Washington reported the first death case in the United States, Governor Jay Insley immediately declared a state of emergency, and other states soon followed up.
On March 3, schools in the Seattle area were closed. In mid-March, schools at all levels across the country suspended classes. On March 6, 2020, some epidemiologists at Imperial College London gave recommendations on the impact of new coronaviruses on the United States.

The White House instructed health officials and scientists to coordinate virus-related public statements and publications with Vice President Mike Penceâs office to dilute the threat and control the transmission of information, a move accused by the public.
The general public's approval of Trump's crisis prevention and control measures has been polarized due to partisan differences.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the United States for relying on imports of key supplies such as basic medical supplies from China.
Air travel mode analysis was used to map and predict the propagation mode and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
According to information released by the International Air Transport Association in 2018, passengers departing from Wuhan to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei are the largest.
It is also reported that Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne are also popular destinations for travelers departing from Wuhan.
According to reports, among the 20 most popular destination cities, Bali has the worst preparedness and Australia has the best preparedness. Australia released a new coronavirus (COVID-19) contingency plan on February 7.
The report pointed out that people's understanding of COVID-19 is not deep enough, and Australia will focus on border control and communication in response to this epidemic.
On March 21, Australia announced that it had entered a "human biosecurity emergency".
Due to the effective isolation of public transportation in Wuhan and other areas in Hubei, some countries and regions have planned to withdraw their citizens and diplomats residing in these areas to their home countries, mainly through charter flights in their home countries and permits provided by relevant Chinese authorities.
Among the first countries to plan to evacuate overseas are Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand.
Pakistan said it will not evacuate overseas Chinese from China.

Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, which are believed to be from China, but actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, China's aid is widely popular in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.
The World Health Organization praised the efforts made by the Chinese authorities in epidemic prevention and control.
The World Health Organization has noticed the contrast between the SARS epidemic in 2002-2004 and this crisis. In the SARS epidemic, the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing the truth, which prevented the prevention and containment efforts. In this crisis, the central government "has begun to update the situation regularly before the Lunar New Year holiday to avoid panic."
On January 23, in response to the central governmentâs decision to implement the closure of Wuhan, the representative of the World Health Organization, Gao Li, said that although this âcertainly is not a proposal made by the World Health Organizationâ, it also âfully reflected the most concentrated The determination of the region to curb the spread of the epidemic" and called the move "an unprecedented move in the history of public health." On January 30, human-to-human transmission was confirmed outside China and the number of cases in other countries increased. The World Health Organization immediately announced that the outbreak constituted a public health emergency (PHEIC) of international concern. The sixth public health emergency of international concern since the measure was first implemented during the epidemic.
The Director General of the World Health Organization Tan Desai pointed out that the determination of public health emergencies of international concern is based on "global risk of transmission, especially to low- and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems."
In response to the question of implementing travel restrictions, Tan Desai said, "There is no reason to take measures to intervene unnecessarily in international travel and trade," and "The World Trade Organization does not recommend restricting trade and mobility."
On February 5, the World Health Organization called on the international community to donate US$675 million to fund low-income countriesâ strategic readiness, stating that there is an urgent need to provide support to countries that "have no supporting system to test for people infected with viruses."
Tan Desai further issued a statement, proclaiming that "the weakest link determines how strong we are," and urged the international community to "invest immediately, otherwise it will cost more in the future." At a press conference on February 11, the World Health Organization decided to name the disease COVID-19.
On the same day, Tan Desai said that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has agreed that "the United Nations will do its best to respond to the epidemic."
To this end, the United Nations launched the United Nations Crisis Management Team to coordinate the response of the entire United Nations. The World Health Organization says that this way WHO can "focus on health response measures, while other institutions can also use their expertise to deal with the wider impact of the outbreak on society, economy and development."
On February 14, a joint Chinese mission led by the World Health Organization was launched, sending international and World Health Organization experts to China to help respond to local outbreaks and assess the severity of the disease by convening seminars and meeting with important national institutions Sexuality and Infectiousness", and through field visits to assess "the impact of coping activities at the provincial and county levels, including different situations in urban and rural areas." On February 25, the World Health Organization announced that "the world should make greater efforts to fully prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," noting that although it is too early to call it a pandemic, countries It should still "enter the ready state".
In response to Iranâs growing epidemic, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation. On February 28, World Health Organization officials said they had raised the global risk level of the coronavirus epidemic from "high" to "very high", which is also the highest alert and risk level for the assessment method.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement: "This is a reality check for governments around the world: be sober.
The virus may be approaching, please be prepared," and urge governments to take corrective measures to avoid the "worst case" in the world.
Ryan further pointed out that the current data are not enough for public health officials to declare a global pandemic. Such a declaration would mean "we basically recognize that everyone on the planet may be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that a new coronavirus outbreak constituted a global pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization said "it is deeply concerned about the proliferation and severity of thought-provoking and the reality of inaction". The World Health Organization has been severely criticized for being deemed to have mishandled the global pandemic, including delays in announcing public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.
Among the stronger opposition voices included the petition requesting Tedros Adhanom, Director-General of the World Health Organization, to submit his resignation. As of April 6, 733,000 people had signed the petition.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized that everyoneâs rights should be respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group pointed out that everyone has the right to enjoy life-saving interventions, and the government should assume this responsibility.
The expert group emphasized that lack of resources or health insurance should never justify discrimination against specific groups.
Experts emphasize that everyone has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minors, the elderly, internally displaced persons, homeless people, groups with extremely poor living conditions, detainees, and refugees and other unresolved people who need government support Specify the group.
International government organizations are actively responding to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform designed to provide comprehensive information, views and suggestions on the policy responses of countries around the world in a timely manner.
From policies that strengthen health systems and the world economy to responding to the effects of blockades and travel restrictions, this digital center has a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and promote global collaboration to meet new coronavirus challenges.
Because the pandemic first broke out in Hubei Province of China, the United States and the United Kingdom Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove and the President of Brazilâs President Jail Bosonaro, Eduardo Bosonaro, proposed the treatment of the Chinese government. criticism.
Several provincial-level administrative officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed due to improper handling of epidemic prevention work in central China, reflecting the central governmentâs dissatisfaction with local political institutionsâ response to the epidemic.
Some commentators believe that this move is aimed at avoiding public dissatisfaction with the CPC Central Committee General Secretary Xi Jinping due to the outbreak of a new coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials (such as Zhao Lijian) have denied previously recognized claims that the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan and supported conspiracy theories that the new coronavirus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.
US President Donald Trump once called the new coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China's "censorship system has intensified the spread of the virus and made it become a global pandemic now", which in turn It was also considered by some critics as a form of racial discrimination, and âdiverted peopleâs attention to the governmentâs failure to contain the virusâ.
"Daily Beast" received a telegram from the US government that outlined a communications strategy apparently issued by the National Security Council, which said, "This is inseparable from China.
We have been told that in any way, including press conferences and TV appearances, we will disseminate this information as much as possible." Media such as "Politicians", "Foreign Policy" and Bloomberg claim that China provides assistance to the countries affected by the disease to promote its global Influence.
Josep Borrell, head of EU foreign policy, warned that there is a âgeopolitical factor including competition for influence through good offices and âgenerous politicsââ.
Borrel also said, "China is vigorously promoting that it is a responsible and reliable partner unlike the United States."
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and reportedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.
On April 3, Ma Yun donated 100,000 masks to Cuba because of US sanctions.
The US authorities have also been accused of transferring aid sent to other countries to their own country.
According to reports, mask disputes also exist between Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey intercepted hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EUâs lack of support for Italy affected by the new coronavirus.
The Italian ambassador to the European Union Maurizio Massari said: "Only China has responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European unity. "
On March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy after speaking with Italian Prime Minister Konte.
The Italian "News" quoted an anonymous "high-level political official" as saying that 80% of Russia's aid "is almost useless to Italy."
The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm offensive.
Attilio Fontana, the head of Lombardy and Luigi Di Maio, the Italian foreign minister, dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "[Putin], when providing assistance to US colleagues, believes that once the US medical equipment and materials manufacturers resume production capacity, they will pay back if necessary."
The planned NATO "Defender 2020" military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea are the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War, and the scale of the exercises will be reduced.
Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Nuclear Disarmament Movement, criticized the "Defender 2020" exercise: "In the face of the global public health crisis, the exercise not only endangers the lives of the soldiers of the United States and many European participating countries, but also the residents of the country where the exercise is located." Iran The government was severely affected by the epidemic, and about 24 parliamentarians and 15 other current or former political figures were infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to leaders of the world requesting assistance. The letter pointed out that US sanctions on Iran prevented Iran from entering the international market, making Iran difficult to fight the epidemic. The outbreak has prompted all parties to call on the United States to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family visits, and raising public health funding.
Political analysts predict that the epidemic may have a negative impact on Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated due to the global pandemic.
Japan announced that everyone entering Korea would need to undergo a two-week quarantine quarantine at a place designated by the government. South Korea subsequently criticized Japan for this "quarantine measure is vague and passive."
Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude towards President Man Jae-inâs crisis response.
Many South Koreans signed the petition, some called for impeachment and Wen Zaiyin, accusing the government of improper handling of the epidemic, while others praised his response strategy. This pandemic prompted many countries to pass emergency legislation as a response.
Some commentators worry that this may allow the government to strengthen its control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted for Prime Minister Orban Viktor to pass a decree to govern indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish him if he was found to have spread false information about viruses and government crisis management.
The various supply shortages can be attributed to the outbreak of new coronaviruses, which stems from increased equipment use in the world to fight the epidemic, panic shopping, and the interruption of factory and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Panic shopping has occurred in many places, leading to the emptying of essential items such as food, toilet paper and bottled water on the shelves, resulting in a shortage of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has also been warning of delayed shipments of electronic products.
The Director General of the World Health Organization Tan Desai said that the public demand for personal protective equipment has increased by a factor of 100.
This demand has caused the price of such products to increase by a maximum of 20 times than usual, and the supply of medical supplies has been delayed by 4 to 6 months.
It also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide. The World Health Organization warns that this will pose a threat to medical personnel.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for purchasing personnel to sell Australian products to China.
This activity led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was immediately banned by the Australian government. Although COVID-19 in Northern Italy and Wuhan is very serious, there is no serious food shortage in these two places.
The measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding of key products and illegal trade have been very successful, avoiding severe food shortages, while such problems are expected in Europe and North America.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not declined significantly, but industry representatives believe that prices may increase.
The phenomenon of emptying food shelves is only temporary, even in Wuhan, and Chinese government officials have also released pork reserves to ensure adequate nutrition for residents.
Italy also has similar laws that require food manufacturers to reserve supplies for such emergencies.
The global economic damage has already affected China: a media report on March 16 said that in the first two months of 2020, affected by the government's epidemic containment measures, the Chinese economy suffered a huge impact and retail sales plummeted by 20.5%.
Because mainland China is the world's main economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak is regarded as a major threat to global economic stability.
According to Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit, the market will remain unstable until there is a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth may exceed the SARS epidemic in 2002-2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the impact of the epidemic on global supply chains will amount to more than US$300 billion and may last up to two years.

The three major indexes fell by more than 10% each week.
On February 28th, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but still maintained a negative outlook.
Public concerns about the new coronavirus caused the stock market to plunge again, with the largest decline occurring on March 16.
Many parties believe that economic recession is a high probability event.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised central banks and states for taking urgent measures in a timely manner.
Compared with the financial crisis in 2008, the central bank reacted faster.
The tourism industry has become one of the industries most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places such as tourist attractions, and the recommendations of governments to avoid travel.
Affected by this, many airlines cancelled flights due to reduced demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas Airlines, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The cruise industry has been hit harder than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Spring Festival, because the Chinese New Year holiday, this was originally an important tourist season.

Many Chinese New Year activities and tourist attractions (including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs) will be cancelled and closed to prevent large crowds from gathering.
Among Chinaâs 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, 24 regions extended the New Yearâs holiday to February 10, requiring most companies not to resume work before that date.
The GDP of these regions accounts for 80% of the country and exports account for 90%.
Hong Kong, China raised the level of infectious disease response to the highest level and declared a state of emergency. The school was closed until March, and the New Year celebration was cancelled. The retail industry is affected globally, and store hours are shortened or temporarily closed.

Shopping center operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as adding sanitation facilities, installing thermal scanners to measure shoppersâ body temperature, and canceling some activities. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-induced economic recession may cause the number of extremely poor people in Latin America to be 14 to 22 million more than when no pandemic occurred.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, approximately 5 million people were unemployed in China.
There are nearly 300 million migrant workers in China, many of whom are stranded in the homes of inland provinces or Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans were unemployed and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the new coronavirus epidemic may cause the unemployment of 47 million people in the United States, and the unemployment rate may reach 32%. The blockade in India has caused tens of millions of (daily-paid) Indian migrant workers to lose their jobs. The Angus Reed Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment. Since the Spanish embargo in mid-March 2020, nearly 900,000 workers have been unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for general benefits. Nearly half a million companies in Germany adopted government-subsidized time-reduction work systems.
France and the United Kingdom have also adopted the German time-reduction work compensation system.
The performing arts and cultural industries have also been hit hard by the epidemic, and organizations and operations around the world, as well as employees and individuals, have not been spared.
Art and cultural industry organizations strive to adhere to their mission (usually funded by the government), show the cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, performing arts venues, and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed to varying degrees indefinitely, and the original exhibitions, events, and performances were forced to be cancelled or postponed.
In response to this situation, all parties began to vigorously provide alternative services through digital platforms. The epidemic will cause many religious services, major sports events and other social activities (such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows) to be cancelled recently, and this negative impact will quickly increase.
The film industry has also been hit. The Vatican has announced the cancellation of the Holy Week commemorative event to be held in Rome during the last week of Christian Lent.

On the Internet, many Internet fans with the theme of new coronavirus spread. Many people are turning to coping with humor and distracted attention as uncertainty spreads.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudice, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asians and people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries have increased.
Many countries and regions, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific, have experienced incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred.
Many reports in February this year (most of the cases were still limited to China at the time) documented the racist sentiments shown by different groups around the world to the Chinese, arguing that the Chinese should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate revenge.
Anti-China sentiment has also risen in some African countries.
According to reports, many residents in Wuhan and Hubei were subjected to regional discrimination.
Both offline and online, there are voices to support the Chinese and residents in areas with severe epidemics.
As the epidemic spread to other hot countries, Italy became the first country in Europe with a serious outbreak of COVID-19. People from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and other countries initially signed a petition requesting that Chinese people be banned from entering their country in an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease.

COVID-19 Workplace Prevention and Control
COVID-19 workplace prevention and control refers to the use of occupational safety and health measures to prevent and control coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper prevention and control of workplace hazards depends on the specific work site and task, and should be determined based on the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of susceptible individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the requirements of the American Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues, so basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to isolate at home after illness, Obey the breathing etiquette and clean and disinfect the working environment daily.
Moderate exposure risk work includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected due to continued community transmission or international travel.
This includes staff who are in contact with the general public, such as schools, high-density working environments, and some large-scale retail environments.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, this group should also use high-efficiency air filters and sneezing protection devices for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment and take other risk prevention and control measures when contacting COVID-19 patients.
OSHA believes that medical staff and mortuary staff who are in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients are at high risk of exposure. If the staff performs aerosol-generating operations on or collects aerosols from known or suspected COVID-19 patients After processing the specimen, the risk of exposure becomes extremely high.
Hazard prevention and control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their tasks.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have a serious impact on the workplace.
Staff may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others, or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in demand for commodities or changes in access to these commodities (such as shopping during off-peak hours, or using delivery or drop-off delivery services).
Finally, product logistics from COVID-19 severely affected areas may be interrupted. Infectious disease prevention and response plans can be used to guide protection actions.
These plans address the level of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors from the home and community environment, and risk factors for individual workers, such as the elderly or groups with chronic diseases.
These plans also outline the prevention and control measures required to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise due to outbreaks.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to follow national or local recommendations.
The goals of responding to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response measures will also be affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the company is located.
The hazard prevention and control level is a widely used prevention and control framework in occupational safety and health. It is used to group hazard prevention and control measures according to their effectiveness.
If the harm of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control refers to isolating employees from work-related hazards, rather than relying on employee behavior for control. This is also the lowest cost solution.
Administrative control refers to changes to work policies or procedures that require workers or employers to take action on their own.
The protective effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) is lower than that of engineering control and administrative control, but it helps prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the level of danger faced by the staff, equipped according to the applicable situation (such as a respirator), and must be properly worn at all times, regularly checked and maintained, replaced if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, Store or handle to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, low-risk exposure work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended to take basic infection prevention measures in all workplaces, including washing hands frequently. Isolate sick employees at home, observe breathing etiquette when coughing or sneezing, provide paper towels and trash cans, prepare for remote work, and shift peaks if necessary Commuting to work, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and keeping the workplace clean and disinfected daily.
The timely identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is the key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees showing acute respiratory symptoms should be quarantined at home for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there is no fever, fever signs and any other symptoms. The sick leave policy should be flexibly implemented to allow employees to care for their patients at home Family members of the disease and should clearly inform employees of this policy.
According to OSHA regulations, moderate exposure risk work includes the need for frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 meters), but may result in individuals due to continued community transmission near the workplace or due to recent The work of contracting SARS-CoV-2 through the COVID-19 epidemic area.
This type of staff includes those who work in schools, high-density working environments and some large-scale retail environments that will contact the general public. The engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, improving ventilation effects, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing protection devices, and installing drop-off windows to provide customer service. Administrative control of this group and high-risk groups includes encouraging sick employees to stay in isolation at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing shift shifts, eliminating unnecessary travel to the COVID-19 outbreak site, and developing emergency communications plans, including A forum to answer staff questions, provide staff with the latest education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behavior, and provide training on the use of protective clothing and protective equipment to staff who need to use protective clothing and protective equipment. Helps improve the resources and working environment of personal hygiene, requires hand washing frequently, restricts customers and the public from entering the work site, and posts signs about hand washing and other COVID-19 protective measures. Depending on the specific task, at least personnel with moderate exposure risk should be equipped with personal protective equipment, including gloves, robes, masks or goggles.
Such workers are best equipped with respirator.
If someone gets sick on the plane, proper protective measures should be taken to protect the staff and other passengers, including arranging the patient to a distance of 6 feet away from other passengers, designating a crew member to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask, or requesting the patient Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
Crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick travelers, touching body fluids, or potentially contaminating surfaces. If the sick traveler develops symptoms such as fever, persistent coughing, or difficulty breathing, the crew should also wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazard bags, and then contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk prevention and control measures also include postponing travel when sick. If fever or other symptoms appear on the ship, they should isolate themselves and immediately notify the ship's medical room.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be conducted in the compartment of the quarantined person. For schools and child care sites, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if an infected person has appeared in the school, regardless of the spread of the community, the corresponding schools and child care sites should be closed for a short period of time, and thoroughly cleaned or disinfected.
For low- and medium-level community communications, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling field trips, gatherings and physical education classes, choirs, or cafeteria dining, and other large gatherings, increasing the distance between desks, and arriving and departing from peaks and peaks. , Restrict non-essential visitors from visiting, and arrange separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
If the community spreads severely, in addition to implementing the social distance strategy, you can also consider extending the suspension time. For law enforcement personnel who perform daily routine activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believes that the direct health risks they face are low.
It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who must be in contact with COVID-19 diagnosed patients or suspected individuals should act at the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during the arrest, staff should clean and disinfect their service belts and equipment before using household cleaning sprays or rags for cleaning and use, and should follow standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures and Clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA believes that certain health care and mortuary workers face high or very high exposure risks.
High-exposure workers include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation workers who actually contact people with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.
If staff perform droplet generation procedures on patients with known or suspected COVID-19, or collect or process specimens from infected or suspected infected persons, the risk of exposure becomes extremely high.
Droplet generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or body cavity specimen collection.
High-risk mortuary staff includes staff involved in organizing the bodies of the deceased who were diagnosed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during their lifetime; if an autopsy is performed, the exposure risk is higher. Additional engineering measures that need to be taken against this risk group include isolation rooms for COVID-19 confirmed or suspected cases, including when performing droplet generation procedures.
Some healthcare facilities and morgues can also be equipped with a special negative pressure ventilation system.
Biosafety level 3 precautions should be taken when handling specimens.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that patients be assigned different waiting areas based on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that personnel working within 6 feet of patients who are known or suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection and those performing droplet generation procedures wear respirator.
The United States requires that NIOSH approved N95 filter masks or better masks must be used in the context of comprehensive written respiratory protection programs such as health testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO recommends that screening personnel at entry points only need to wear medical surgical masks.
WHO recommends the use of medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves for staff who need to collect respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without performing droplet generation procedures.
If the droplet generation procedure is to be performed, the medical surgical mask must be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 mask.
In view of the insufficient supply of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends that through physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, only direct caregivers be allowed to enter the COVID-19 patient's room, only when it is really necessary to use personal protective equipment for certain tasks, and when nursing Patients with the same diagnosis continue to use the same respirator, monitor and coordinate the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and discourage asymptomatic people from using masks to reduce the demand for personal protective equipment.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide has exceeded 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths are related to the disease caused by coronavirus-COVID-19.
On the same day that the milestone occurred, Malawi confirmed the countryâs first coronavirus infection, and Zambia had the first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claims that as of Thursday, the country is one of the few countries that has no coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 1051635 confirmed cases, including 79332 cases within 24 hours before 10 am (0800 UTC) on April 4, Central European Time.
In the United States, there are more than 244,000 coronavirus cases reported, causing at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News cited data from Johns Hopkins University that on Wednesday, coronavirus infection caused more than 1,000 deaths in the United States.
All over the world, various countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the closure date to May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians will continue to be paid during the shutdown throughout the country until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favor, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to full-day curfews; previously, curfews were only valid from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10 pm and 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the home order to May 1.
2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The incubation period from contact with the patient to onset ranges from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.
Although the symptoms are mild in most cases, some cases develop viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, the total number of reported cases in 210 countries and regions exceeded 2.24 million, and the number of deaths exceeded 153,000.
More than 568,000 people are currently recovering from treatment. The virus spreads from person to person through close contact, often spread by droplets generated when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although the breath will produce droplets, the droplets usually fall to the ground or the surface of various objects, and will not cause long-distance infection.
In addition, if someone touches the surface contaminated by the virus, and then touch their eyes, nose, mouth and mouth, they may also be infected with the virus.
The virus can survive on the surface of the object for up to 72 hours.
Although it may spread during the early and late stages of recovery, it is most contagious three days before the onset. The standard diagnostic method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection of nasopharyngeal swabs.
It is recommended that people suspected of having a virus infection and their caregivers wear masks.
Recommendations on wearing masks by the public vary from place to place. Some authorities oppose wearing masks, while others require them to wear masks.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine or specific antiviral treatment plan.
The vast majority of countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or may have symptoms of suspected flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, confusion, difficulty in sobering, and blueness of the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.
In addition, different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were also monitored.
Some Chinese cases showed symptoms of chest tightness and palpitations at the beginning.
Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and even death.
We call this the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected people will have symptoms within 11.5 days after infection. The report pointed out that not all infected people will have symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic infected persons in the spread of the epidemic has not been fully clarified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that asymptomatic infected persons may promote disease transmission.
The proportion of asymptomatic infections has not yet been determined, and research is still intensified. The Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of the confirmed cases did not show any symptoms during hospitalization.
The China National Health Commission has listed asymptomatic cases in daily notifications since April 1. Of the 166 infected persons on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when tested.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large amounts of virus.
Speaking loudly sprays more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that an unobstructed cough may cause droplets to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although such viruses are generally not transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences determined that they may be transmitted by biological aerosols, and the air collector in the corridor outside the ward detected positive samples of viral RNA.
Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can nebulize respiratory secretions, which can cause airborne transmission.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but this risk is considered low. When a patient develops symptoms, the virus is most contagious; although it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet fully clear, generally 1 person can infect 2-3 people. The survival time of the virus on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, it is known that the new coronavirus can survive on cardboard for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% pure copper products for up to four hours.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soaps and detergents can also kill viruses. Soap products can degrade the fat protection layer of the virus, making it inactive, while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China showed that saliva samples were collected on average two days after admission.
5/6 patients had the highest viral load in the first sample, and 1/6 patients had the highest viral load detected the next day.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three pneumonia patients with a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Before the virus enters the human body, you can use household soap to kill it, because soap can destroy the virus's protective capsule. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant type 2 alveolar cell in the lung.
The virus binds to ACE2 through a special surface glycoprotein called "spike" (capsule particles) and enters the host cell.
Among the patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, 12% of infected people found acute myocardial injury, and a higher proportion of severe patients.
The systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders are caused by the deterioration of the disease, and the incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the heart's ACE2 receptor.
The ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in the heart and participates in regulating cardiac function.
It is reported that the incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) in patients with COVID-19 infection monitored by ICU is relatively high, which may be related to a poor prognosis. COVID-19 fatal patient autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism on respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE2, COVID-19 severe patients will experience excessive systemic inflammation.
In particular, the pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells in COVID-19 patients are associated with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6 secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology.
The autopsy report also showed lymphocyte infiltration.
WHO has announced several disease detection programs.
The standard detection method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples can also be used.
Under normal circumstances, the results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can also be performed, but it requires two weeks between the two blood samples, and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish gene sequences, so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection reagents to detect whether they are infected with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can not only detect active infections, but also whether individuals have been infected with viruses in the past) is still under development, but has not yet been promoted.
According to Chinese experience, the detection accuracy is only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the US FDA approved the first immediate diagnostic reagent, which was put into use at the end of the month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by the Central South Hospital of Wuhan University propose a method for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Early infections are more common in multiple lungs with multi-leaf ground glass shadows, with peripheral asymmetry and posterior distribution.
As the virus progresses, subpleural dominance, lithotripsy signs (thickened leaflet septa with varying degrees of alveolar filling), and pulmonary consolidation may occur.
There is very little information about the microscopic pathological damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy are as follows:
Visual inspection: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, lung cell hyperplasia, a large number of atypical lung cells, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and the formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in convalescence stage: mechanization of alveolar exudate and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); young white-young red blood cell reaction
To reduce the chance of infection, preventive measures that can be taken include: staying at home; avoid entering crowded areas; often wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintain good respiratory hygiene; avoid touching eyes without washing hands, Nose or mouth.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends covering your mouth and nose with tissues when you cough or sneeze; if you do not have tissues, it is recommended to use the inside of your elbow to cover it.
It is recommended to properly clean hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing.
CDC recommends wearing cloth masks in public places to prevent asymptomatic patients from spreading the virus to some extent. The core of the social distance strategy is to close schools and workplaces, restrict travel, and eliminate large public gatherings, thereby reducing the chances of infected people coming into contact with large groups.
In addition, the social distance criterion requires a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 meters) in interpersonal communication.
There are no effective drugs to prevent COVID-19. Given that it is expected that the vaccine will not be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are the key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, which is what we know as "flattening the epidemiological curve."
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when there is obvious dirt on their hands, before meals, and after blowing their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
In addition, it is also recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% to wash hands, but only when there is no soap and running water around. For regions where water-free hand sanitizer cannot be purchased, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity with ethanol or isopropanol.
Use hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a "hand disinfection active substance".
Add glycerin as a humectant.
Provide supportive care for people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and other important organ support.
CDC recommends that suspected virus carriers wear simple masks.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to relieve the symptoms of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain personal hygiene and promote a healthy lifestyle and eating habits to improve immunity.
For mild patients with early infections, supportive therapy may be effective. WHO and China's National Health Commission issued an initiative calling for proper care of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.
American critical illness specialists and lung specialists have compiled the treatment recommendations put forward by various institutions and made them available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, COVID-19 special therapy has not yet been developed.
For some symptoms, some medical experts recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line treatment.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, and operations that may generate aerosols in a medical environment, such as intubation or ventilation by hand, should pay special attention to protection.
For healthcare workers who care for patients with COVID-19, CDC recommends that in addition to standard precautions, exposure precautions, and airborne precautions, patients should be transferred to an airborne infectious disease isolation room (AIIR). The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an outbreak.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If possible, it is best to use a respirator (not a mask).
N95 masks are approved for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of such masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is mainly used to prevent the inhalation of suspended particles (such as dust), but when used for other purposes, it cannot guarantee the effective isolation of specific biological agents.
If you donât have a mask, CDC recommends using a face mask. You can also wear a self-made mask if necessary.
Most COVID-19 cases have mild symptoms and do not require the use of mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Medical staff are actively carrying out research, hoping to provide respiratory support for COVID-19 patients who have symptoms of respiratory failure. There is evidence that intubation can be avoided with nasal high-flow oxygen therapy or biphasic positive airway pressure ventilation.
It is unclear whether the above two treatment schemes can produce the same effect on severe patients.
If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use invasive mechanical ventilation because this technique can also limit the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to nasal high-flow oxygen therapy. Severe cases are mainly in the elderly (over 60 years old, especially over 80 years old).
In many developed countries, the number of beds per capita is insufficient. In view of the limited medical conditions, the medical system cannot cope with the severe situation that requires hospitalization due to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases.
A study in China found that 5% of patients need to be sent to the intensive care unit, 2.3% of patients need mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% of patients will be fatal.
About 30% of COVID-19 admitted patients in China are eventually sent to the ICU.
With the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation is further increased, and the difficulty of oxygenation is becoming more and more difficult.
At that time, a ventilator that supports the pressure control mode and high PEEP will be used to maximize the delivery of oxygen, while minimizing the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by the ventilator.
Older ventilators may not achieve high PEEP.
Since January 2020, research on potential therapies has begun, and several antiviral drugs have entered clinical trials.
Redoxir seems to be the most promising drug at present.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or have entered advanced testing.
Severe patients can try antiviral drugs.
WHO urges the majority of volunteers to participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential therapies. The FDA has temporarily authorized recovery plasma transfusion as an experimental treatment to treat critically ill patients who are dying of life.
At present, the necessary clinical research has not been carried out to prove whether the therapy can safely and effectively treat this disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain the outbreak.
The user needs to enter the name and ID number as required.
This application can detect "close contact" through monitoring data to determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
Once a potential risk is detected, the application will not only recommend self-quarantine, but also alert local health officials. Comprehensive use of mobile phone data big data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government approved security agencies to track cell phone data of suspected coronavirus carriers.
The purpose of this measure is to enforce quarantine and protect groups that may contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom and the German Federal Government Agency Robert Koch Institute shared aggregated mobile phone location data in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect people who violate the isolation regulations.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera pointed out that mobile phone operator data shows that â40% of citizens are still walking aroundâ.
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for creative solutions worldwide to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or worry about infections can all be confusing.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor's point of view, "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are the perfect storms that hurt people's mental health and well-being."
This disease is relatively mild, with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to data from other similar viruses (such as SARS and MERS), pregnant women have a higher risk of developing COVID-19 severe patients, but COVID-19 data support is lacking. COVID-19 may affect the lungs of some people and cause pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19 related complications include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
6% of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital had abnormal coagulation, especially prothrombin time extension, and 4% of patients in this group developed abnormal renal function.
About 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have elevated liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the average time from onset to death is ten days, of which the average length of hospitalization is five days.
However, the average time from admission to death for patients transferred to the ICU is seven days.
Early case studies have found that the average time from early symptoms to death is 14 days, and the overall time range is 6 to 41 days.
A study by the China National Health Commission (NHC) found that the male mortality rate was 2.8% and the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of the autopsy lung samples showed that both lungs showed diffuse alveolar injury with cell-fiber mucus-like secretions.
Viral cytopathies were observed in lung cells.
Lung imaging is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, 11.8% caused cardiac injury due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of admitted patients have a previous medical history. Medical resource supply and regional socioeconomic conditions may also affect mortality.
Due to regional differences and methodological difficulties, the estimates of disease mortality are different.
Underestimating mild cases can lead to overestimating mortality.
However, if the case death was due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Compared with non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop COVID-19 in critically ill patients, and require 2.4 times more intensive care or lethality. People are concerned about the long-term sequelae of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority of China found that the lung capacity of some of the recovered patients decreased by 20% to 30%, and lung scans showed organ damage.
In addition, you may face post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unclear whether previous infections will enable the rehabilitated person to obtain effective long-term immunity.
According to the behavioral characteristics of other coronaviruses, it is believed that immunity may be produced, but there are reports that some COVID-19 cases were positive for coronavirus tests shortly after recovery.
It is believed that these cases are persistent infection worsening rather than reinfection.
This virus is considered a natural virus, originated in animals, and is infected through overflow.
The actual origin has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the range of infection is almost entirely interpersonal transmission.
The first batch of 41 confirmed COVID-19 case studies published in The Lancet in January 2020 showed that the earliest onset date was December 1, 2019.
The earliest onset date reported in WHO official publications is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region and will change over time, and are affected by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time of the first outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths, and U07.2 to clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 infection but without laboratory A confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 death. The case fatality rate is equal to the total number of deaths in a given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The case fatality rate is different in different regions. Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR). The former reflects the percentage of deaths from disease to the number of diagnoses, and the latter reflects the deaths from disease to the number of infections (including confirmed and undiagnosed) Number of people).
These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process from infection to case resolution for a specific population.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infected people.
The Italian epidemic centre Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with a population of only 4,600. At present, 80 people (1.7%) have died from the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various carnivals and even affected young people, but the mortality rate was relatively low, and not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified.
In addition, the German medical system is already overwhelmed.
Evaluation of blood donors shows that about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
As of now, it has been confirmed that 69 people (accounting for 0.004% of the total population) have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and mortality vary by gender.
Studies in China and Italy show that the mortality rate of men is higher than that of women.
Men aged 50-60 years are at the highest risk of death, with only a 90-year-old gender gap being similar.
The mortality rate of males in China is 2.8%, and the mortality rate of females is 1.7%.
The exact cause of this gender difference is not clear, but it may be caused by genetic and behavioral factors.
Based on gender-based immunological differences, females have a lower smoking rate, and males have comorbidities (such as hypertension) at a younger age than females, resulting in higher male mortality than females.
In Europe, 57% of men are infected, and men account for 72% of the total deaths due to COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked gender-related data on COVID-19 infection.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher, and the risk of exposure to the virus is also higher.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease will be officially named "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained this: CO stands for "coronal", VI stands for "virus", D stands for "disease", and 19 stands for the time of the first outbreak (December 31, 2019).
The name was chosen to avoid referencing specific geographic locations (for example, China), animal species or people, in order to comply with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "viruses that cause COVID-19" in mass communication.
Diseases and viruses are commonly known as "coronaviruses".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, people commonly referred to viruses and diseases as "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, according to the 2015 guidelines on the use of location in disease and virus names, WHO recommended that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases be used as temporary virus and disease names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 will be released on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity constraints of the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have begun printing health care materials such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, an Italian hospital urgently needed ventilation valves. The supplier could not deliver the parts within the required time. A local start-up company performed reverse engineering and printed out the 100 ventilation valves required overnight.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease were overwhelming and quickly spread through the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
Government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers are actively carrying out international research and developing vaccines and drugs to treat COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Unity Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that are currently most likely to produce therapeutic effects.
There is currently no vaccine, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through the ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to use the previous work of SARS-CoV.
Three vaccine strategies are being studied.
First, the researchers plan to develop a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response in the body when newly infected with COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop a subunit vaccine that aims to develop a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this type of research focused on S-spike proteins that help virus invade the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop nucleic acid vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the test vaccines developed by the above strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first vaccine clinical trial.
The vaccine contains harmless gene sequences copied from the virus that caused the disease. It has always been thought that antibody-dependent enhancement may become a major challenge in the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this argument is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials have been carried out.
Seven trials completed evaluations and were approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Switching antiviral drug use accounted for the vast majority of Chinese research, and nine phase III clinical trials of redoxivir will be conducted in multiple countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidate has begun. Several existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 are currently being evaluated, including redcivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combination interferon beta .
As of March 2020, the efficacy of redoxivir has been initially confirmed.
Observations have shown that the symptomatic symptoms of patients treated with sympathetic medication redoxivir have eased.
Phase III clinical trials are currently underway in the United States, China, and Italy. In February 2020, China launched chloroquine (used to treat malaria in the past) and achieved preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of this research.
South Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1 gram per day, while reminding that twice the dose is very dangerous and may even be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorizations for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to use the above two drugs to treat patients with COVID-19. Chinaâs seventh edition of the guidelines also proposes the use of interferon, ribavirin, or apidol hydrochloride to treat COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high-dose ribavirin has an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
After confirming the low concentration of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to use nitazoxanide for further in vivo studies. Studies have shown that the original spike protein triggered by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with the ACE2 receptor into the human body.
Regardless of whether it is used in combination with azithromycin, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies have serious limitations. Unless further research is done, the medical community cannot accept these therapies. Oseltamivir has no inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has not been found to have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
Cytokine storm may become a complication of later treatment for COVID-19 severe patients.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. After completing a small study, China's National Health Commission included tocilizumab as a treatment guideline.
Following a positive test result for critically ill patients, Italy is conducting a national phase 2 non-randomized trial.
Combined with blood test of serum ferritin, identification of cytokine storm is aimed at curbing the development of the disease, and cytokine storm is thought to cause death of some infected persons.
In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, the FDA approved the use of interleukin 6 receptor antagonists to treat steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by other causes, known as CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is effective in the treatment of CRS.
At present, we are studying the extraction of purified concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of COVID-19 rehabilitation persons, and injecting them to people who need the antibodies, as passive immunotherapy before the vaccine is successfully developed.
This strategy was tried during the SARS epidemic, but the efficacy is still inconclusive.
Viral neutralization is an expected mechanism of action by passive antibody therapy mediated SARS-CoV-2 immune defense.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis can achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are currently being developed, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies.
The amount of serum produced during the rehabilitation period may increase, which facilitates rapid deployment. The serum consists of the liquid part of the blood of the recovered patient, which contains specific antibodies against this virus.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, improved his knowledge of the spread of the new coronavirus, and unfortunately contracted COVID-19 and died.
Australian stores lowered the maximum amount of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles nationwide lowered the purchase limit of toilet paper purchases for each of their stores to two packs and one pack, respectively.
ALDI also introduced restrictions on buying one pack on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of messages at the cash register or posted on the chainâs Facebook page.
It is reported that buyers are hoarding goods because of fear of COVID-19 in case they need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper delivered to the door to a single package.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced restrictions on purchasing 4 packages per transaction on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles reported in its March 8 press release that after implementing the 4 purchase limit, "many stores are still sold out within an hour of arrival", saying that the demand is "unprecedented". At the same time, ALDI In a Facebook post on Tuesday, he called it "unexpected."
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, last week's sales "increased dramatically".
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowed quantity to two packs.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional inventory, and ALDI prepared inventory in advance for planned Wednesday specials.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers tried to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made this difficult.
He expects that as suppliers try to meet demand, production costs will rise, while preferential activities will decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early release of inventory, some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday special events.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store replenishes inventory every night.
He said that toilet paper is a large item, so the inventory quantity is small, and once sold out, it will leave a huge shelf space, exacerbating the feeling of shortage of materials.
"The point of view of Coles and Woolworths is that if there are many things on the shelves, goods like roll paper and hand sanitizer are [buyable] and the quantity is sufficient, you may not be so scared." Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Shu Jie toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent toilet paper, both emphasize that they are working around the clock and open on weekends to ensure supply.
Real estate website Domain.com reported that because buyers are taking a break on Labor Day long weekends, the number of auctions held is small, so some real estate agents will provide free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne.
NT News is a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, and its Thursday edition of the newspaper contains 8 pages of inserts intended for use as toilet paper after cutting.
According to ABC Australia's report on March 3, the store was initially reluctant to implement purchase restrictions, and they said they had no plans to implement purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other commodities is also high, including masks, hand sanitizer, dry goods, hand sanitizer and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 2 packs of 12 rolls per pack on Sunday night.

Since this month, we have encountered some difficult situations.
In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we clearly felt the destiny of all mankind, and also recognized our responsibility to each other.
We are faced with unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best measures to deal with this challenge require people around the world to empathize, cooperate and promote community building, which is the core concept of Wikimedia.
All colleagues communicate friendship and care to each other through email, phone and chat, which fully proves the extraordinaryness of our colleagues and how we are fortunate to work with you.
I am extremely grateful and proud to be a colleague with you.
Last week, someone expressed appreciation for our work.
They made me realize that Wikipedia is available all over the world at this moment, what a meaningful thing it is, and it also made me realize that this critical resource keeps functioning and symbolic to people all over the world. power.
Whether your job is responsible for website operations, salary payments, or community security, the normal operation of Wikimedia is inseparable from your hard work.
The world today needs information from Wikipedia more than ever.
At this stage, our work content and working methods will have an important impact on the world.
In view of the importance of this mission and the important tasks shouldered by colleagues, we will make some important adjustments to our collaborative approach starting next week.
Work style and schedule adjustment
As Robyn mentioned before, the executive team met last night to discuss the company's working methods and schedule in the next few days to several months.
At the meeting, we considered what we believe to be appropriate responses to the company's current challenges and best practices to ensure the company's sustainability during the outbreak.
The executive team unanimously agreed to reduce the pressure on the company's employees, so that everyone can support the company's mission for a long time.
We support you to reduce work pressure appropriately.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), and subsequent changes will be notified later.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer hours every day, we will arrange tasks for you based on your working hours.
However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as caring for your family, going out for shopping, or seeing a doctor.
We will not track your working hours.
If you are sick, please put down your work.
Although this is self-evident, we still want to remind you, please rest assured.
You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team modify the work calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed with a positive COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the Human Resources and Cultural Operations Department, which will provide support to you and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from management.)
For hourly-paid employees, we will pay in full.
We have already expressed and promised again to abide by the promises made to contractors and hourly colleagues.
The salary we pay to everyone will continue to be calculated based on the remuneration they receive under normal circumstances for completing normal working hours.
Even if you are sick or unable to work, it is no exception.
If you are willing to work, we will support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through work to relieve their stress.
Our work can bring incredible returns, even more so in the current period.
But taking care of yourself is still the number one priority.
We require you to maintain communication with your manager so that we can understand your latest situation and make adjustments accordingly.
Prioritize important work.
We must maintain the normal operation of some important work.
The work performed by the website reliability engineering team, human resources operations team, trust and security team, and fundraising team (and other teams) is critical and may require additional support.
We will begin to work with all departments to evaluate current goals and shift our focus to supporting matters that are critical to our mission.
All of us have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus our work on the most important projects.
Temporarily slowing down will not affect future development.
We do not intend to "overtime work and progress" after the epidemic.
We will not ask you to work overtime to catch up with the deadline, because now it seems unrealistic.
We accept that the current environment has changed, and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.
What will happen to the APP (annual plan)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and daily working time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 annual plan.
We hope to propose to extend the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time for budgeting, so that employees can prioritize key tasks and take care of themselves and their families; at the same time, for those who need or hope to reduce the workload in the next few weeks Employees adjust work arrangements.
Extending the timetable can significantly reduce the current planned workload of the entire organization and reduce work pressure.
We will make the above proposal to the board of directors next week. If the proposal is passed, we will update the follow-up work arrangements to all representatives and teams as soon as possible.
Thanks to the leadership of the APP team in this process.
Office conditions, exposure and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that a colleague in the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of caution, we hired some anti-virus cleaners to fully disinfect the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-level disinfection solutions to disinfect various surfaces as well as the halls and elevators that lead to our floors.
The office building is fulfilling its duty-of-care agreement and using corresponding products to ensure the safety of tenants.
We believe that when everyone decides to return to work, the office is fully prepared to welcome everyone.
Our Washington DC office uses the WeWork office. WeWork shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington DC staff.
As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office has switched to full-person remote office based on the guidelines we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some colleagues in the New York office already know, we have been discussing the issue of renting office space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing, but may be postponed.
Some colleagues are exposed to teleworking for the first time.
Other long-term colleagues who work remotely hope to provide some suggestions for adjusting the working methods for these colleagues:
The meeting time should be controlled within one to two hours.
If you need more time, please consider distributing the content of the meeting to meetings with multiple dates.
Clearly define the meeting objectives, set the meeting agenda, and send reading materials in advance.
Use video conferencing as the default meeting method, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom for online collaboration and contact.
In each meeting, arrange a host to host the meeting, arrange one person to monitor the questions in the chat window and track the changes in the speaker list, and arrange another person to take charge (or use multi-person collaboration) to help take the meeting record.
If you need comfortable headphones, please send an email to contact technical support.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The human resources operation team is studying ergonomic guidance in the form of webinars to help all Foundation colleagues improve their work efficiency during the distributed office.
Last week, we asked all community beneficiaries to cancel public activities funded by Wikimedia, such as Editor Pine, before the WHO announced the end of the outbreak.
These requests for cancellation of activities and other restrictions may prevent these community payees from completing the original donation activities. We have informed them that we understand this, and we also promise that none of them will delay or modify these goals. And be punished.
In the following week, we will continue to provide more guidance at Wikimania and other regional community meetings and themed community meetings.
The global community seems to be shrouded in the grief caused by the destruction of the epidemic, but it also reflects the relief of being able to clearly maintain the concern of their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and track the communication between the community and us.
Keep in touch and communicate COVID-19 related issues
We plan to hold a special staff meeting at 14:00 (Coordinated Universal Time)/07:00 (Pacific Time) next Thursday, and we will send you an invitation to your calendar later.
At the meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and set aside some time for everyone to discuss.
We are united and dedicated to help you here.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and gather all the information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries currently affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, main workflow or insurance, or need other help, please feel free to contact the CRT team and cooperate with them.
We are here to provide you with the support and contact you need.
If you have confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Head of Global Human Resources Operations.
Although we are faced with these changes, we cannot give up our work and obligations.
On the contrary, this epidemic made us realize that we may need to adjust our work and obligations in a way that has not been done before.
We believe that these measures are necessary to allow us to support each other to continue to complete their work, provide the support we need for our actions, and continue to bring the services they rely on to the world.
Plan well at all times so that you are not afraid of challenges.
Now, please support each other and create space for important work in the coming weeks and months.
We need everyone to contribute to this goal, so please take good care of yourself and your family to keep you in top condition when you need it.
Finally, please remember to wash your hands frequently and don't touch your face.
Katherine, CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases"
On February 6, 2020, our team released the "2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection Diagnosis and Treatment Quick Recommendation Guide", through which we provide experience and lessons for the global response to outbreaks.
However, 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease. Based on the ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our knowledge of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to an opinion on the above guidelines, and provided the latest "suspected cases" and "according to the latest "COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan (seventh edition)" issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. "Diagnosed cases" diagnostic criteria.
In December 2019, the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) broke out. At present, the disease has been officially named the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The virus was once named severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation guide and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted widespread attention.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Based on the ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our knowledge of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of the Peopleâs Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued a total of 7 editions of the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020. , Some of which have undergone substantial changes.
Now, our guidelines have received comments from Zhou et al. They have proposed a simple scoring scheme based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidelines and a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We recognize and thank them for this important work they have done.
However, their proposal also needs to be updated based on the latest "COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Program (Trial Version 7)" and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the diagnosis of a suspected case requires a combination of an epidemiological history feature and two clinical manifestations for comprehensive analysis. If there is no clear epidemiological history, it needs to meet Three clinical manifestations:
Epidemiological history: (1) Have traveled or lived in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities with COVID-19 cases reported within 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (nucleic acid Positive test) history of contact; (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities reporting COVID-19 within 14 days before symptoms appear; (4) with aggregation Confirmed cases (within 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms, within a small range of exposure â¥ 2 patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school classes, etc.) have a history of exposure.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or decreased white blood cell count and decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of onset.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases, and there is any one of the following etiological or serological evidence: (1) SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR test was positive; (2) The whole genome sequencing of the virus showed that Known new coronaviruses are highly homologous; (3) Specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were positive in the serum test; or SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies changed from negative to positive, or in The titer rises â¥4 times in the recovery period, which is higher than that in the acute period.
We can see that the second edition (January 18, 2020) and the third edition (January 22, 2020) added real-time PCR nucleic acid detection in respiratory or blood specimens.
The fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (February 8, 2020) increased the etiology of blood specimens; the seventh edition later added serological evidence.
These modifications are based on the continued work of researchers to study the best nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens including blood collection, which increases the availability of different specimens and incorporates positive results for specific antibodies into the diagnostic criteria Provided evidence.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us to pay attention to atypical and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
In addition, the scoring system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we hope that more direct evidence will appear and appeal to readers to make comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that you refer to and follow the latest guidelines in the country where the cases are located.
Our team will also update our guide in time to help.
Bangladesh reports 5 new COVID-19 deaths, a new high
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed that there were 5 new cases of COVID-19 deaths on that day.
This hit a new high of single-day deaths caused by the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Epidemiology, Disease Control, and Research Institute (IEDCR) reported 114 cases of infection cases, and 33 cases were cured after rest at home.
A total of 17 deaths.
At an online press conference, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the head of the IEDCR, said the deaths included 4 males and 1 female.
According to Dr. Meerjady, there are 2 cases over 60 years old, 2 cases between 51-60 years old, and 1 case between 41-50 years old.
She also said that two of the dead patients were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on March 11 that COVID-19 is a pandemic disease.
A hospital official revealed to the local news media Anadolu Agency that one of the dead patients was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladeshâs Minister of Road Transport and Bridge Obaidul Quader announced via an online video that the public transport suspension will be longer than originally planned and extended to this Saturday.
The public transportation suspension began on March 26 and was originally planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Basic materials such as medical care, fuel and food can still be transported normally.
Of the first COVID-19 confirmed cases recorded in Bangladesh on March 8, 2 people returned from Italy, and the other patient was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.
As of March 19, all three patients have recovered.
World Health Organization announces COVID-19 as pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that a continuous outbreak of COVID-19 (a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) is a pandemic.
Although the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, not the degree of risk of specific cases, the WHO noted the need to urge the government to take measures:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If various countries/regions test, test, treat, isolate, track, and mobilize their people as a response," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
"We are deeply concerned about the alarming degree of proliferation and severity and the alarming degree of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented."
He commented on CNN in February, "Except for the flu, no respiratory virus has been found to continue to spread globally after its emergence."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
He continued, "Similarly, we have never seen a controllable virus pandemic before."
Before entering a new state of pandemic, WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "The most important thing is that it is still getting worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
2019 Respiratory Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus laboratory tests include: detection of the presence of the virus and detection of antibodies after infection.
RT-PCR can detect the RNA of the coronavirus and determine whether the virus is present in the sample.
This test is specific for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.
It can be used to determine whether it has been recently infected or has an active infection.
Antibody testing (serum test) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody testing shows how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with mild symptoms that have not been reported or asymptomatic.
This test result can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of population immunity in the population.
Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country can provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country/region has more than 3% of the population tested, and the number of tests completed by each country/region varies greatly.
This difference may also seriously affect the reported case fatality rate. In some countries, this rate may be severely overestimated.
Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection using throat swabs can only obtain reliable results if it is completed within the first week after infection.
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with pharyngeal swabs can only achieve reliable results if it is completed within the first week of infection.
After that, the virus disappeared in the throat, but continued to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons who are tested in the second week after infection, the sample may be replaced with a deep respiratory extract obtained through a sputum tube, or cough (sputum) may be used.
In January 2020, rRT-PCR was released at CharitÃ© Hospital in Berlin, which was one of the early PCR tests and became the basis for the 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed a test method. On January 28, 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It looks for the "E" gene common to all beta coronaviruses, as well as the RdRp gene unique to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to obtain the emergency use approval of the China National Drug Administration for the production of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to the Public Health Laboratory through the International Reagent Resources Department.
The early version of the test kit used three genetic tests, one of which was unable to determine the result due to a defect in the reagent. At the same time, the Atlanta CDC had a detection bottleneck; this resulted in an average sample that was successfully processed every day throughout February 2020 The number is less than 100.
The two-part test method was not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, at which time the state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
This test is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. The US Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announced that from March 5, 2020, RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also announced that it will provide nationwide COVID-19 testing from March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit declared; sample collection and processing must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and produced by the National Virology and Biotechnology Research Center (VECTOR).
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federal Health Supervision Office. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic has developed a kit to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, a test method of Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA. This method can complete a large number of tests in 3.5 hours, enabling a device to perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA issued Abbottâs m2000 system for emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories; FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid's test method, which took approximately 45 minutes, was also authorized by the FDA for emergency use.
The FDA has approved a detection method that uses nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this method does not require a series of temperature change cycles, a positive result can be obtained in only 5 minutes, and a negative result can be determined within 13 minutes.
There are currently approximately 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a detection method that uses monoclonal antibodies (specifically combined with the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of a new coronavirus), and hopes that it can provide test results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.
A review of the literature in March 2020 came to the conclusion, "In the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of chest radiographs is small, and the performance of CT [Computed Tomography] may be obvious, even before symptoms appear."
Typical features of CT include multilobe ground glass shadows of both lungs, with peripheral asymmetry and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, lithotripsy signs, and lung consolidation will develop.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan (the place where the current pandemic first broke out) showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less accurate, and many of its imaging features are different from other pneumonia and Diseases overlap.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19 or as a first-line diagnostic tool to diagnose COVID-19." Starting in March 2020, CDC recommends the use of PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect the infection of individuals about 7 days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immune status of the monitored population. Measurements can be performed in a central laboratory (CLT) or through point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Many high-throughput automated systems in clinical laboratories can perform these measurements, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although a sequence sample can be used to track the immune response, it is usually measured using a peripheral blood sample.
For PoCT, skin puncture is usually used to obtain a blood sample.
There is no need to perform an extraction step before the measurement, which is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, FDA approved the testing methods declared by 29 entities, and these entities are now able to distribute their antibody testing kits.
As of April 7, 2020, FDA approved only one test based on the emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Omon Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics' test kits were approved in Europe. These kits can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The detection capability is that hundreds of samples can be detected within a few hours. Therefore, the determination of viral RNA is much faster than traditional PCR.
In general, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody detection kits it purchased were easy to use.
Hong Kong has established a mechanism for suspected patients to be able to stay at home. The "emergency room provides patients with sample test tubes." The patient spit saliva into the test tubes, and then sends the test tubes back. The results will be received later. The British NHS announced that it is piloting a plan to detect suspected cases at home, so as to eliminate the risk of patients infecting others when they go to the hospital, and also eliminate the risk that patients must disinfect the ambulance after using it. When conducting a COVID-19 suspected case-free test, healthcare professionals can take appropriate precautions to take samples.
The drop-off testing center has helped South Korea to conduct faster and more extensive testing than other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that non-inpatient institutions have the capacity to perform approximately 12,000 tests per day, compared with 10,700 tests last week.
If the test is performed at the request of a doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.
The director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany stated that Germany's total weekly testing capacity is 160,000 copies.
As of March 19, car-free testing has been provided in many large cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of people tested in Germany is not known, because only the number of people who tested positive was reported.
An initial laboratory survey showed that as of the 12th week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples (including the 12th week of 2020) were tested, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 . In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospitals developed and tested a method for simultaneously testing samples from 64 patients, that is, aggregating samples, and only conducting further tests when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, BGI temporarily established a 2,000-square-meter emergency testing laboratory called "Fire Eye", which was put into use on February 5, 2020, and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was built within 5 days under the supervision of Wang Jian, founder of Huada Gene. The modeling showed that if the above detection capabilities were not achieved, the cases in Hubei would be 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment and isolation costs would double.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately established the Huoyan laboratory, which is currently established in 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the daily throughput of laboratory testing will total 50,000 copies per day. Origami Assays released an open source, multi-channel design that can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 with only 93 measurements. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for automatic pipettes.
As of March, reagent shortages and shortages have become obstacles to large-scale testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
This has led some promoters to explore sample preparation protocols, which involve heating the sample to 98 Â°C (208 Â°F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on March 31 that it has now conducted a new coronavirus test on more of its population, testing more people than any other country, and is expanding the level of testing to allow a large number of people to be tested.
The way to achieve this detection capability is to use drive-through testing on the one hand, and to fund Group 42 and BGI (based on its âFire Eyeâ emergency testing laboratory in China) to establish a response High-throughput laboratories for large-scale population testing needs.
The laboratory was built within 14 days and can perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day. It is the world's first laboratory of this scale operating outside of China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different detection methods for various parts of the coronavirus gene map.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test kits, sending kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German method was announced on January 17, 2020; the plan developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be available until January 28, thereby limiting the USâs testing capabilities. Both China and the United States encountered reliability problems of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak. These two countries and Australia could not provide enough test kits to meet the needs and test recommendations made by health experts.
Contrary to this, experts believe that extensive testing in South Korea is helpful in reducing the spread of new coronaviruses.
Thanks to the testing capabilities established by the Korean government in the past few years, it is mainly concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for additional testing programs as the best way to slow down the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to a very high demand for testing, which has caused a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private US laboratories, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents has also become tight.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by CDC have "deficiencies"; subsequently, the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test box from the Chinese company Shenzhen Yirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and found that the test results were not accurate.
The company explained that inaccurate test results may be caused by incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of test kits.
The Spanish Cabinet stated that it would recover the kit that returned the wrong result and replace it with another kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China have incorrect test results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China and found it to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister MatoviÄ suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. AteÅ Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test boxes purchased by Turkey from China had a âhigh error rateâ and did not âput them into useâ. The UK purchased 3.5 million test cartridges from China and announced in April 2020 that these test cartridges were unusable.
Testing and quarantine the positive test results and tracking the contact history of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons can achieve positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of VÃ² (the place where the first COVID-19 patient died in Italy) conducted two rounds of testing for a population of approximately 3,400 people, with each round separated by about ten days.
About half of them were tested positive and asymptomatic, and all found cases were isolated.
By adopting travel restrictions on the community, new infections are completely eliminated.
Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on inbound travel, detection and quarantine, the rate of coronavirus transmission in Singapore in 2020 is much slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not adopted extreme restrictions, such as mandatory closure of restaurants and retail establishments .
Many activities have been cancelled in Singapore. Residents were advised to stay at home starting on March 28, but the school resumed classes on time on March 23 after the holidays.
Several other countries, including Ireland and South Korea, have also managed to control the large-scale epidemic of the disease through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on inbound travel, detection and isolation, and less aggressive blockade measures.
A statistical study found that relative to the number of deaths, the higher the number of countries tested, the lower the mortality rate of cases, the reason may be that these countries can better detect only mild symptoms or asymptomatic groups.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capabilities and limited national laboratory experience in handling COVID-19 send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to 16 WHO reference laboratories One of them is checked for confirmation.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 are located in Europe, 2 are located in Africa, 1 is located in North America, and 1 is located in Australia.
In the following chart, the "% positive test" column is affected by the country's testing policy.
Under the same conditions, compared with countries where all citizens are tested (whether or not showing symptoms), countries with only inpatients have a higher positive detection rate.
From January 1 to March 15, 2020, the cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK has increased rapidly
The cumulative incidence of new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in various countries in the EU/EEA and the UK, confirming that although different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly development of.
According to the Italian experience, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units all need to be more fully prepared to meet the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 patients, and intensive care tasks are particularly important.
On December 31, 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China reported multiple cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the pathogen was a new coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2.
Thereafter, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, ie respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most can recover.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 will progress to critical illness and require hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases will progress to critical illness and require intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in various countries of the European Union/EU/European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compared them with Hubei, China Provinces are compared.
We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK between January 31 and March 15, 2020 with Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has been further expanded. At present, the dynamic changes of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the European Surveillance magazine published on March 5, 2020, Spitteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe based on the WHO case definition.
In EU/EEA, France reported the earliest three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020. The patients were returned from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have detected COVID-19 cases. From December 31 to March 15, 2019, including that day, 39,768 cases and 1,727 have been reported There were 17,750 deaths and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtain the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of reported COVID-19 cases in every country around the world at 8:00 am every day. They are only obtained from official sources, such as the ministries of health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
These data have been used to assess EU/EEA and UK COVID-19 trends and compare them with Italy.
We calculated the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom from January 1 to March 15, 2020, as an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, In order to consider the natural course of COVID-19.
We also provide the total number of reported cases in each country as of 8:00 am on March 15, 2020, and compare it with data from Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncation of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased from around February 21, 2020, and then increased sharply around February 28 (Supplementary Material).
This is mainly due to the rapidly increasing number of reported cases in Italy, but the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom also shows a similar growth trend (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom from January 31 to March 15, 2020, compared with Italy.
It should be emphasized that as of 8:00 AM on March 15th, the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy in less than 3 weeks.
Our results indicate that the number of notified COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the UK is rapidly increasing.
The observed trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicate that the outbreak is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although each country is at a different stage, the national public health response measures are different, the definition of cases may be different in each country, and the options for selecting patients who must undergo COVID-19 definitive diagnosis testing-including additional testing-are different, but the situation is the same.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in affected areas in Italy, approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients require intensive care, and media reports indicate that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have reached their maximum capacity.
At the EU/EEA level, currently available data are only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases hospitalized and/or admitted to the intensive care unit, respectively (data not shown).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner to supplement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of intensive care and mid-term care beds available in European countries varies greatly. The number of beds per 100,000 people ranges from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (from 12.5 intensive care and mid-term care beds per 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 by the ECDC modeled scenarios related to the saturation of healthcare capabilities, and the prevalence and surpassing of intensive care beds of inpatient COVID-19 patients in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom The relationship between the amount of risk & 90% was estimated.
Since the cases have so far been concentrated in EU/EEA countries and certain areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually provide services for the population covered in a certain area, it is best to be at the level of âstandard statistical geographic unit 2â (NUTS-2) Provide information about cases and intensive care beds.
The Italian experience and current trends in other countries indicate that the EU/EEA and the UK's COVID-19 pandemic are rapidly developing.
Therefore, the state, hospitals, and intensive care units should be prepared to cope with the continued community spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the need for medical care, especially the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care, such as the emergence of affected areas in Italy Case.
As the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment pointed out, a fast, active and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, and a transition from containment to mitigation methods is required because if not implemented in advance, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may be There is not enough time for policy makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adjust response measures.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is currently a short window of opportunity, and countries may use this to further increase control to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health care system.
Otherwise, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
CoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of sense single-stranded RNA viruses with an envelope.
The origin of zoonotic diseases of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptability have been driving the co-evolution of coronaviruses (Coronaviruses, CoV) and their hosts (including humans).
Prior to 2003, two types of human coronavirus (HCoV) were known to cause mild diseases such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation and revealed the destructive and fatal nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 once again made CoV the focus of attention. Surprisingly, compared with its sister virus SARS-CoV, it is more spreadable but less pathogenic. .
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease, so it is helpful for us to understand the origin of HCoV's zoonotic disease.
Most HCoV is derived from bats and is non-pathogenic.
Some HCoV intermediate storage hosts are also known.
Identifying animal hosts is of direct significance for preventing human diseases.
Studying the interaction of CoV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of human CoV.
In this review, we outline the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, highlighting their discovery history, origin of zoonotic diseases, and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and controlled different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, we discussed the current epidemic situation of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, this article also focuses on the requirements for the successful completion of host conversion and the impact of virus evolution on the severity of the disease.
These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, containing 26,000 to 32,000 bases, and are called "coronaviruses" (CoV) due to their coronal appearance under an electron microscope.
The other five Î²-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Structurally, CoV has a non-segmented genome that shares similar tissues.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs of structural proteins, including spikes (S), envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nuclear proteins (N).
Many lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoV.
According to the differences in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four genera (Î±-CoV, Î²-CoV, Î³-CoV, and Î´-CoV), where the Î²-CoV genus contains most of the HCoV and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that bats and rodents are the gene source of most Î±-CoV and Î²-CoV, and birds are the main hosts of Î³-CoV and Î´-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
To date, seven types of human coronavirus (HCoV) have been known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are Î±-CoV.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress Syndrome (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
In the mid-1960s, the first HCoV-229E virus strain B814 was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with common colds.
Since then, through extensive research on both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that can cause self-limiting symptoms, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge.
In fact, before the outbreak of SARS, the concept that HCoV infection is usually harmless has been widely accepted.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 is one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 infected people and a crude mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.
2019 The new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the 2019 epidemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As of March 3, 2020, more than 3,120 lives have been captured and infected More than 91,000 people.
The alarm has sounded and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin from bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Various evidences indicate that all the evolution of HCoV originated from bats. The viruses in bats have good adaptability and no pathogenicity, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origin of HCoVâs zoonotic disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces, and limiting factors of viral species jumping.
In addition, this will guide or promote the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts, and expanded animal hosts, and is of great significance for preventing future virus spills.
In this review, we outline the origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoV zoonoses.
In particular, we emphasized and discussed a common problem, that is, the parental virus of HCoV is usually not pathogenic in its natural storage host, but is pathogenic after it has spread to new hosts across species.
In addition, we also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV, in which the increase in transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Animal CoV has been widely known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal secretions of patients with common colds, medical scientists have isolated them in various infected animals (including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs) Different CoV.
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will provide us with rich information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E virus strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection and subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort, and sore throat, and 10-20% of patients have symptoms such as fever and cough.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture of the suckling mouse brain and subsequent serial passage.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, and the symptoms are not very different from other respiratory pathogens (such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus) infection.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed all over the world, mainly in winter in temperate climates.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, and then the disease will occur for about 2 weeks.
A human volunteer study showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E will develop a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with immunocompromise show severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first fully recorded pandemic caused by HCoV in human history. Its pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first SARS case can be traced back to Guangdong Province, China, at the end of 2002.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to super-transmitters, it is estimated that each case may bring about 2 secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and a peak viral load on the 10th day of onset.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, discomfort, and chills, followed by advanced symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and respiratory distress.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory test abnormalities of SARS.
In addition, diffuse alveolar injury, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these critically ill patients, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys may also be infected, and are usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal in patients with immunocompromised .
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a source patient from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Another independent study showed that the same virus was isolated from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Although the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence is in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis (also known as Grub's laryngitis).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, there are reports that HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma attacks.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found all over the world and can cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases. But there are also accidents with unknown causes, such as a rare subtype of HCoV-NL63 that is more toxic. Recently, it has been reported that this subtype causes severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to effectively spread and survive in the human body, their toxicity or pathogenicity will also decrease.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary transmission to close contacts.
In 2015, secondary sexual transmission broke out again in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also have acute renal failure, which is a unique feature of MERS in the diseases caused by HCoV so far.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, with a case fatality rate of 34.4%, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to man.
In mid-to-late December 2019, patients with aggregated pneumonia were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which was confirmed by retrospective analysis to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been diagnosed globally, with a crude mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the case fatality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the case fatality rate outside Hubei is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory tract infections, manifested by fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% homology of high nucleotide sequences, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic, but more contagious.
According to reports, SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections have appeared, which may have accelerated the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
At this point, the general trend of SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the other six HCoVs.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other 6 HCoVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and 4 community-acquired HCoVs (ie, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the characteristics exhibited by SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in community-acquired HCoV infections, including non-specific, mild, or even asymptomatic manifestations.
On the other hand, a small proportion of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infection cases, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of community-acquired HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the spreadability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoV.
On the other hand, whether the spreadability of SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will decline after human passage is still to be verified.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
At least in some cases, whether the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in SARS-CoV remains to be clarified in future studies.
In addition, it is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal like community-acquired HCoV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, such as the spread, pathogenicity and continuous transmission after human passage, will have an important impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All 4 community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have also adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both parties may be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoV, which causes serious human diseases, and people with severe HCoV diseases have perished.
To this end, HCoV must replicate enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations to fight host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people infected, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it can adapt well, its spread in humans will be difficult to prevent through isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, these 4 community-acquired coronaviruses have spread among the population, causing people with normal immune function to get a common cold.
These viruses do not require animal hosts.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans, nor can they continue to spread among humans.
They need to survive and reproduce in zoonotic hosts, and may find opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate hosts and expanding hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 community-acquired HCoV.
It is as contagious as community-acquired HCoV, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it can fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a host or intermediate animal remains to be seen.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, it is of certain guiding significance for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of HCoV's evolutionary host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host and expanded host.
If an animal has closely related ancestors that are highly homologous at the nucleotide sequence level, the animal will become an evolutionary host for HCoV.
Progenitor viruses are usually highly adaptable and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the storage host will continue to carry HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host for HCoV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if HCoV parasitizes the human body shortly after or soon after, it will not be able to adapt well to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a source of zoonotic human infections, and by allowing the virus to replicate briefly, and then spread it to humans to expand the scale of human infections, thereby playing the role of amplifying the host.
If HCoV cannot maintain its transmission in the intermediate host, terminal infection may occur.
On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even establish a long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural storage host.
Retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that index cases of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seropositivity surveys showed that compared with the general population, the levels of anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) in animal dealers are higher.
On the live animal market, civet cats (flower raccoon cats) and a raccoon cat were found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses almost identical to SARS-CoV viruses for the first time.
After removing all the civet cats from the market, there is no further SARS report, which indirectly supports the above view.
However, the report stated that wild or untouched live animal market civets were basically negative for SARS-CoV, indicating that civets may only be intermediate amplification hosts rather than natural hosts for SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that since 80% of different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that a variety of small mammals may also serve as intermediate expansion hosts for SARS-CoV.
All these animals seem to be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent studies on the natural animal host of SARS-CoV discovered a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-associated chrysanthemum coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survived in the Chinese chrysanthemum bat.
These bats were positive for the SARS-CoV antibody and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
The virus and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
In addition, the researchers have also identified multiple SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but with the exception of a designated WIV1, no virus can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known receptor for SARS-CoV.
Experiments have shown that WIV1 extracted from bat fecal samples uses bat, civet, and human ACE2 as its receptors into cells.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS convalescent patients can neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although these two viruses are highly homologous, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parental virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not a direct storage host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis categorizes MERS-CoV as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5 in the same group.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the corresponding RNA in bat Î²-CoV from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV has only 87% nucleotide sequence homology with its close relative, CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct storage host for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are positive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as are the camels originating in the Middle East in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV isolated from the nasal swab of the dromedary came from the same virus found in humans, which further indicates that the camel is the true storage host of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, the general symptoms were mild, but a large amount of virus shedding was observed.
It is worth noting that infected camels not only spread the virus through the respiratory tract, but also spread the virus through the faecal-oral route, which is also the main route for bats to distribute the virus.
However, the problem persists because many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which may be due to human-to-human or unknown transmission routes, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV RaTG13, a bat isolated from A. chinensis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to determine the parental relationship.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have shown that an endangered small mammal called the pangolin (Malay pangolin) may also carry the ancestor Î²-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
In other words, unless the same bat coronavirus is found in the future, bats may not be the direct storage host for SARS-CoV-2.
It is speculated that among the wild animal species that the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be sold and slaughtered in the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, many of the initial COVID-19 cases were related to it, indicating that an animal-to-human transmission event may have occurred .
These new pangolin coronavirus genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with about 90% homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
In the phylogenetic tree, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2-like virus sublines, one of which has a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2 and has a 97.4% amino acid sequence Homology.
In sharp contrast, the RBD difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is greater, although the genome-wide sequence homology between the two is higher.
An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, and the results were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different assembly methods and manual processing to obtain a partial genome sequence that accounted for about 86.3% of the entire genome of the virus.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to differences in the Î²-CoV sequence associated with SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the Î²-CoV associated with pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the Î²-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 related to SARS-CoV-2 had the highest genome-wide sequence homology Sex.
It can be highly speculated that the high similarity between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related Î²-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is caused by the selective mediated convergence evolution.
Another contrary view is that pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related Î²-CoV and RaTG13 recombine in a third wild animal species.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread in Î²-CoV.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2's direct zoonotic disease is currently inconclusive.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the researchers also studied the origin of zoonotic diseases of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronavirus, and the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.
The report states that the bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in North American tricolor bats is shown to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus (called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008) found in Ghana, and camels are also suspected to be their intermediate hosts.
For clarity, Figure 1 and Table 2 summarize the existing knowledge about the animal origin of known HCoV.
Phylogenetic analysis provides evidence for the interspecies transmission events of HCoV in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from cross-species of domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases emerged.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
The bat Î±-CoV closely related to HCoV-229E has been discovered.
Between the two appeared a kind of alpaca Î±-CoV.
There is a lot of evidence to support the virus spreading directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpaca, may come into contact with bats in a common niche.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, bat Î±-CoV associated with HCoV-229E is diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca Î±-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, no alpaca Î±-CoV was found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that the alpaca obtains Î±-CoV related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats spread HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Or, although the bat Î±-CoV acts as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpaca and dromedary may be intermediate hosts that spread the virus to humans, which is exactly the same as MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good illustration of the interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV of bats was known in its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries reinforce this argument.
Obviously, bats provide a rich virus species library for interspecies exchange and interspecies transmission of gene fragments.
Long-lived and dense groups, close social interaction and strong flying ability are all favorable conditions for bats to become ideal "virus spreaders".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the dromedary for decades.
It adapts well to these camels, and camels have also changed from intermediate hosts to stable natural storage hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.
Its sporadic spread to humans is an accident, and due to the unsustainable spread, humans are still the terminal host of MERS-CoV.
Compared with the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (if any) is different.
In particular, pangolin Î²-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the terminal host of Î²-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the civet cat in SARS-CoV.
In future research, it is necessary to determine or exclude several possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, the bat may be a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolin may be one of the intermediate expansion hosts for new invasion of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses.
Humans are infected with viruses by slaughtering and eating game.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
It is necessary to carry out antibody surveys on domestic animals and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may be recombined and adapted in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal hosts, the three main viral factors also play an important role in promoting coronaviruses to cross interspecies barriers.
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared with other single-stranded RNA viruses, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is estimated to be "moderate" to "high". According to the adaptation stage of coronaviruses to new hosts, the average replacement rate per site 2 is about 10-4 times per year .
Coronavirus has a proofreading activity of exonuclease, and its deletion will lead to very high variability and attenuation, even unable to survive.
Interestingly, the nucleoside analog Remdesivir is known to inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with host receptors is another key factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Redoxir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of coronavirus is about 1 million times higher than that of its host.
In addition, if the coronavirus does not adapt well to the host, its mutation rate will usually be high.
Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate, indicating a higher adaptability to humans.
It can be speculated that it has adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that is well adapted to dromedary.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 rapidly ineffective.
Second, the larger RNA genomes of coronaviruses have additional plasticity in the modification of genetic mutations and recombinations, thereby increasing the possibility of inter-species co-evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are appropriate.
A large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3'end of the genome provide evidence for this.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch templates through a unique "copy selection" mechanism during RNA replication.
In the host as a mixing container, chain exchange frequently occurs during the CoV RNA transcription process.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNA can recombine to produce new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural reorganization has been found in animal coronaviruses such as HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interactions related to propagation
Based on the comparative analysis of SARS-CoV isolates from human and civets, the researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through mutation of the S protein RBD to achieve this process.
This article takes SARS-CoV reorganization as a typical example and shows evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but binds to different parts of S.
Normally, the RBD in the coronavirus S protein interacts with cellular receptors and is closely screened for host antibody responses.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in amino acids 318 to 510 of the S1 fragment, and it binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptor to allow the virus to enter.
SARS-CoV's RBD can recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civet cats, mice and civet cats, so that the virus can spread between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues different from human and civet virus isolates were observed in RBD, 4 of which were located in the receptor binding motif that interacted with the ACE2 receptor.
There are K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of civet SARS-CoV, which may increase the affinity of the fibronectin to interact with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have the same cell receptor.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S protein S1 unit is 30%, which means that the binding affinity of the S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a cryo-electron microscopy study showed that this binding affinity is 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also make sense to determine whether any other co-receptors are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N of HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid of HCoV-OC43.
They may also explain why the coronaviruses described above successfully adapted to humans after spreading from animal hosts across species.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of HCoV interspecies transmission are also affected by other host-dependent and restrictive factors.
Differences in these host proteins between humans and natural HCoV hosts such as bats, dromedaries, and rodents may constitute barriers to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must deprive host dependence factors and break host limitation factors in order to successfully achieve interspecies transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in the important field of virus-host interaction are still to be determined and characterized.
Unbiased genome-wide screening of the host dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may yield results.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to the origin
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoV.
In this sense, bat coronavirus acts as a gene pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene recombination are also the driving factors of HCoV evolution, and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the gain or loss of genes encoding new proteins may completely change the phenotype of the virus.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, SARS-CoV-associated bat viruses have been isolated, but it was found that they can encode different ORF8 proteins, so it is considered that ORF8 is important for adapting to humans.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide deletion characteristics of SARS-CoV were found in the isolated virus strains.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have recombined with the Î±- and Î³-CoV lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombination regions were found in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also found in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the prevalence of MERS-CoV has undergone recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in the dromedary of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoV and other animal coronaviruses recombined in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that manual selection may lead to unexpected changes in the viral genome, which is most likely due to the reduction of the selection pressure imposed by the virus on the host immune system.
An example of these effects is that in the HCoV-229E prototype virus strain, the deletion of the dinucleotide results in the deletion of the full-length ORF4.
Although the complete ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca Î±-CoV showed a single nucleotide insertion, causing a frameshift mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoV is also driven by storage host selection pressure.
After the bat was infected with coronavirus, asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected, indicating that the coronavirus and the bat adapted to each other.
From an anatomical and physiological point of view, bats seem to adapt well to coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of bat proinflammatory responses effectively reduce the pathological changes caused by coronavirus.
In addition, due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and the low expression level of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, the natural killer cell activity of bats is inhibited.
Moreover, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the high metabolic activity of bats can not only inhibit coronavirus replication, but also influence proofreading by exonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for virus strains to enter the new host with high pathogenicity.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is not accidental that three new HCoVs have appeared in the past two decades.
Coronavirus does not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate a lot and do not cause a strong host immune response.
This is why there are asymptomatic carriers and serious human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of the immune response and cytokine storm, so the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy to delink the immune response may have a positive role in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.
Therefore, it should be beneficial to use type I interferon at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, there is a defect in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in bats.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are based.
Although bat Î²-CoV with 95% nucleotide homology to SARS-CoV has been found, there is also a bat coronavirus with 96% nucleotide homology to SARS-CoV-2.
Although civet cats and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been determined.
At present, pangolin Î²-CoV, which is obviously homologous to SARS-CoV-2, has been found, which indicates that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin Î²-CoV may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally manufactured.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus has once again become the focus of attention.
Research on coronaviruses in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the origin of HCoV zoonoses and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
A lot of evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civet cats on the market, closing the wet market and killing the civet cats can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Similarly, in view of the discovery of multiple pedigrees of pangolin Î²-CoV closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be further studied.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedary for a long time.
These camels are important means of transportation and the main source of local people's meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to follow the practice of the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
To stop the recurrence of MERS, comprehensive measures should be taken in conjunction with other infection control measures to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camels.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear, which in turn may cause outbreaks.
Various zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in the wild.
In particular, the diversity of bat coronaviruses with potential for zoonotic diseases is quite high.
These zoonotic coronaviruses have many opportunities for evolution and recombination, leading to new coronaviruses that are easier to spread and/or deadly in humans in the future.
In some places in China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should formulate better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.
They stay in their natural hosts until opportunities for overflow occur.
Although bats have many characteristics that are conducive to the spread of viruses, if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wild species, human exposure to bats and other wild species will be greatly reduced.
In order to better understand the ecological status of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, it is necessary to continuously monitor mammals. Facts will prove that this is very useful for preventing the spread of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In short, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is that humans should stay away from the niche of the natural host of zoonotic viruses.
There are still a few missing points in the mystery of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 zoonosis.
First, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, then it makes sense to investigate when bats and pangolins can share the same niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human communication, how humans contact bats remains to be determined.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, surveillance and experimental infection studies should be conducted.
In the case of bats, pangolins or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parental virus will be found in natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will reveal the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
