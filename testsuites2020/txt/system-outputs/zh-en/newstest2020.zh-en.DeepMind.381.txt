Patients with severe and critical new coronavirus pneumonia will progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome in a short period of time. Non-invasive or positive pressure ventilation support will be an important means for the treatment of severe and critical diseases, which will help to improve the clinical treatment rate of new coronavirus pneumonia and reduce the mortality rate of seriously ill patients.
Good airway management is of great significance to improve the efficiency of respiratory support, reduce complications and promote rehabilitation.
Topic
Effect of EP4A on the expression of human CD34+ cell dryness factor.
Purpose
To investigate the mechanism of prostaglandin E2-specific receptor agonist 4 (EP4A) to enhance the expression of human CD34+ cell dryness factor.
Methodology
To collect the peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell collection of 20 healthy donors mobilized by G-CSF in the blood department of No. 1 Hospital affiliated to Zhongshan University, and select human CD34+ cells by immunomagnetic bead method.
After using EP4A, EP4A + EP4A antagonist (EP4AA) to act on human CD34 + cell 72 h, the differential genes and pathways related to CD34+ cell dryness were detected by heat map and Pathway enrichment analysis. Then qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of pathway protein and differential gene mRNA and protein (β-catenin, Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Stat3, AKT, P38) in different groups of cells.
Results
Compared with the control group, the expression of β-catenin, Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 mRNA and their proteins in CD34+ cells in group EP4A increased, while the expression of STAT3, AKT, P38 mRNA and their proteins did not change. When EP4A and EP4AA (XAV939) co-interacted with human CD34+ cells, the expression level of β-catenin in human CD34+ cells decreased significantly.
Conclusion
EP4A can increase the expression of human CD34+ cell dryness factors (β-catenin, Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2) rather than STAT3, AKT and P38.
The Republic is about to celebrate its 70th anniversary. The spotlights of various media are suddenly lit, allowing many images that we do not usually remember to shine-it is they who bring heat and light to our shining days...
However, if the hero walks around, he also looks as ordinary as you are like me.
Yuan Longping devoted himself to rice research, raised good seeds and plowed all over the world, so that more than a billion Chinese people would no longer be at risk of starvation. This man is usually like an old farmer who likes to walk in the fields. Nanrendong, the chief scientist who makes China's "heavenly eyes" angry, does only one thing in his life. He nibbles cold steamed bread in the deep mountains of Guizhou, just like the old man in the stockade. Zhou Ruchang, a red scholar, a village boy who was very late in his life, was still like a red child in his old age. He studied all over China and the West, with shaggy white hair, and liked to clatter and laugh when talking about learning. Qin Yi, a film artist in the middle of the red sky, over the age of 90, still bumps on the plateau for six or seven hours a day in order to rehearse, and is willing to play an unknown old maidservant in "The Story of the Goblin"...
They, seeking kindness, live a simple, simple and persistent life. As long as they are immersed in the cause that outsiders do not understand and they cherish themselves, they will easily be happy and do not care about fame, wealth and prosperity.
Like Jin Yong's novels, the sweeping monk of the Tibetan Sutra Pavilion in Shaolin Temple, although he embraces amazing martial arts, does not dazzle, has no joy or sorrow.
Every "sweeping monk", every pair of red hearts, has a share of the responsibility of his family and country behind him.
The responsibility of home and country is not only carried on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hands of hundreds of millions of Chinese people.
Once, the words of a female high school student were wildly turned by netizens. "When a hero passes by, someone will always sit by the side of the road and clap... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a person sitting by the side of the road and clapping."
In fact, there is no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
People who applaud by the side of the road are also transmitting heat and light. They are also luminous bodies.
Ordinary as you are like me, there are always some opportunities in life, some moments, a kind of accumulation over time, also shaping the appearance of a hero.
Zou Bihua, an excellent judge in Shanghai, shouldered the heavy responsibility of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting, he asked the teacher of the communication room to come to the stage to tell his story. He received and sent countless newspaper letters a year. He never made a mistake. "Doing simple things well is not simple". Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to the old "sweep monk"-style receiving and sending.
This is a pity between heroes. One hero is applauding another.
The sweeping monks have the Shaolin Temple Tibetan Sutra Pavilion, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experimental field, Nanrendong has a "heavenly eye", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Ruchang has a forum... whether you can be a hero depends not only on your own efforts, but also on a good environment and a positive incentive mechanism.
For example, "China's Sky Eye" now seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese scientific and technological community was still struggling to climb the slope, and novelist Liu Cixin had not yet written "Three Body".
At that time, the most bullish "eye" was Arecibo, a one-sided radio telescope in the valley of the American island of Puerto Rico, 350 meters in diameter, considered the largest in the "insurmountable" world.
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope was less than one-tenth the diameter of others.
Nanrendong, who enjoys world-class scientific research conditions and salary in Japan, insists on returning home and brings back a near-crazy idea: building a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China to receive more messages from outer space!
China is ready to spend a lot of money to play with the stars?
The motherland trusts Nanrendong, and the "Sky Eye" project has a vast opening.
It took 12 years to select the site and another nine years to complete the project.
With the opening of the 500-meter-caliber "Sky Eye", China has made a "great scientific project unique to the world" without precedent.
Therefore, the "Sky Eye" is great, the Nanren East is great, and the Republic with a large face and a high telescope is great.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nanren East has the opportunity to become the soul of the country and the heart of the people.
Some young talents and white-haired heroes walked affablely, and some people applauded gently by the side of the road. Such a country is very beautiful and harmonious.
Lignocellulose is widely found in nature. Due to its complex structure, its efficient degradation requires the collaborative interaction of many microorganisms. Due to the variety of microorganisms involved in the degradation of lignocellulose, its collaborative degradation mechanism is not completely clear.
With the rapid development of microbial molecular biology and histology technology, it will provide new methods and ideas for the study of the mechanism of microbial collaborative degradation of lignocellulose.
The author's previous research found that the bacterial complex strain showed a strong ability to degrade lignocellulose at 50°C. The strain consisted of isolateable culture and temporarily inseparable culture bacteria, but the isolateable culture bacteria had no ability to degrade.
Through the study of macrogenome and macro transcriptome, it is shown that the expression of some genes related to the degradation of lignocellulose has changed significantly. Through histological methods, it is possible to explain in greater depth the microbiological and enzymatic mechanism of microbial collaborative degradation of lignocellulose.
This paper reviews the research progress of microbial degradation of lignocellulose from three aspects: enzymes, pure culture strains and composite flora, with emphasis on the present situation and application prospect of histological technology in analyzing the action mechanism of composite flora, with a view to providing reference for exploring the mechanism of collaborative degradation of lignocellulose by microbial communities.
Garbage classification education first entered Jilin kindergarten environmental protection concept from the doll
On the 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province, launched a garbage classification education course to teach young children to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other types of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that garbage classification has entered the local early childhood education classroom.
A few days ago, nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the "Work Plan for Promoting the Classification and Disposal of Local-level Urban Domestic Waste in Jilin Province".
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot of the compulsory classification of domestic waste in Changchun, the province decided to carry out the classification of domestic waste in prefecture-level cities.
Jilin is one of them.
We hope that through this activity, we will realize the effect of driving the family with young children and the society with kindergartens, and advocate the concept of environmental protection.
Hi Fan Er International Kindergarten Executive Director Liu Lijuan, who organized the event, said.
On the same day, the director of the park read out an environmental protection initiative, hoping that the classification of garbage will start with children.
After performing the dance of "Low Carbon Beibei", the children played a small game of garbage sorting in groups.
The instructor also issued a "recyclable" "other garbage" label, advising children to stick the label to the garbage can and record small videos when they return home.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has always advocated the concept of low carbon and green environmental protection, and regularly opened environmental protection lecture halls.
A sortable garbage can has also been set up at the garbage disposal site in the park, which is marked with the type of discharge.
The teacher taught the children what is recyclable garbage geese.
According to preliminary statistics, the amount of urban domestic waste generated in Jilin Province in 2018 was about 5,465,200 tons, all of which went into domestic waste disposal sites for treatment.
Of these, 3,292,900 tons were sanitary landfilled, 2,092,300 tons were incinerated, and 801,000 tons were treated by comprehensive utilization process.
After years of efforts, all cities and counties in the province have the capability of harmless disposal of domestic waste.
In the "Work Plan for Promoting the Classification and Disposal of Local-level Urban Domestic Waste in Jilin Province", which has been issued, it is clearly required to carry out in-depth activities such as garbage classification into schools, teaching materials and classrooms, and strengthen the interaction between students and parents by creating garbage classification songs, ballads, comics, micro-videos and other works, so as to achieve the effect of "educating a child, influencing a family, driving a community and training a new generation".
According to data released by Mazda on September 27, global sales in August were 117,015 vehicles.
Due to the impact of inadequate delivery of new models and reduced price reductions, sales in China fell by 21%.
Japan's domestic sales fell by 6%, and demand for the last bus before the consumption tax increase in October was limited.
In August, Mazda's sales in China were 17,729 vehicles.
In August 2018, it was also 13% lower than the previous year, and sales continued to decline.
Sales of China's dedicated main SUV "CX-4" decreased by 14%.
A long time has passed since the launch of the "CX-4" in 2016, and the effect of the new car has declined.
As a result of the strategy of raising brand value from a long-term perspective and reducing price reduction, it is also known to have a great impact on sales.
Mazda's sales in the United States increased by 7% year-on-year to 27,482 vehicles, a 14-month increase.
In August, the seller's business day was one day more than the previous year. Together with "strengthening publicity and other promotional activities" (Mazda), the sales of SUV "CX-5" and so on increased.
Japan's domestic sales fell 6% to 14,422 vehicles.
The company said the emergency rush before the tax increase "did not reach the level of the last (2014)."
Sales of small cars such as "Demio" decreased.
The legacy of Chirac's death
On the 26th local time, former French President Jacques Chirac died suddenly at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in a great change that has not been seen in a century, the French politician still deserves our praise for the many political legacies he left when he came to power.
Chirac served as President of France for 12 years in a very charismatic manner.
He not only inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of de Gaulleism, but also firmly supported European integration, and was a representative figure in the pursuit of the "European Dream".
At the same time, he also strongly advocated world multipolarity and multilateralism, and was a politician with a strategic vision.
For this reason, the French media described him as "France's outstanding representative on the world stage".
One of Chirac's favorite political decisions was to oppose the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, resisted American pressure and was at the forefront of the anti-war effort.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an intensification of terrorist activities and make the world more dangerous.
Later facts proved that Chirac's warning was correct.
At a time when European integration is at a standstill and the unilateralism of the United States is becoming more and more prominent, looking back on the past, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs undoubtedly have strong enlightenment significance.
Chirac is also a French politician who makes the Chinese feel familiar and kind.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of China-France relations. After being elected President of France for the first time in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of China-France relations with the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a brand-new stage.
During Chirac's administration, the bilateral trade volume between China and France grew rapidly. The cooperation between the two countries in many fields such as aviation, nuclear energy and railway transport has made breakthrough progress.
The Sino-French Cultural Year, initiated by Chirac, has created a brand-new cultural exchange model in the history of China and France.
Chirac's lifelong love of Chinese culture is particularly impressive.
According to Chinese diplomats who know him, Chirac can recite some poems by Li Bai and Du Fu, and even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes.
"If you don't look at the pyramids, you don't really go to Egypt. If you don't look at the Qin terracotta, you don't really go to China"-this golden sentence comes from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said, "The West has some concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and China's political status in the world.
But I myself have full confidence in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization. Its experience is enough to help it establish the concept and values of achieving harmonious development and assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time."
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creative vitality to the world culture and enrich the world culture.
The people are gone, but the political legacy and inspiration that Chirac left to the world will last forever.
With the theme of "Gathering the Valley of Light and Enjoying the Future", the "Seventh Academic Conference on Big Data of the China Computer Society" was opened in Wuhan on the 27th. Nearly 1,000 experts, scholars and industry leaders in the field of big data research paid attention to the hot research issues of big data and interpreted the technological process of big data in the era of artificial intelligence.
The conference, organized by the China Computer Society (CCF) and co-sponsored by the Committee of Experts on Big Data of the CCF and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, organized five invited reports and 188 forum reports, and set up 33 thematic technical and industry sub-forums to exchange and discuss the research results in the basic theory of big data, big data education, big data visualization, big data finance and science and technology, respectively.
The purpose of the CCF Academic Conference on Big Data is to strengthen the contacts and exchanges between scholars engaged in the field of big data at home and abroad, promote multidisciplinary cross-integration and the development of the big data industry. After seven sessions, it has developed into the most influential academic conference on big data in China, focusing on the exchange of scientific research results. The content of the conference has been expanded to the fields of basic theory and technical application.
Formed members of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR joined forces to oppose the US-Hong Kong Bill
It took nearly two months. The restoration of the large-scale mural "Map of the Holy Monuments of the Queen of Heaven" in Tianjin Tianhou Palace, a key cultural protection unit of the state, was completed on the 26th and will be reopened to the public during this year's National Day.
The "Map of the Holy Monuments of the Queen of Heaven" is a large-scale traditional mural that comprehensively reflects the life of Mazu.
With the approval of the relevant state departments, it was drawn by Cai Changkui, former curator of Tianjin Folklore Museum (Tianhou Palace), from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this mural is painted on the south and north walls of the main hall of Tianhou Palace. It is 32 meters long and 2.6 meters high. It is divided into two parts. With more than 30 stories such as the birth and fall of Tianhou, the crossing of the sea by banquet and the rise of feather into the sky, 358 characters reproduce the life stories of Mazu.
Cai Changkui said that in recent years, Tianjin has been rainy in summer and dry in winter. This "one wet and one dry" has led to the rupture of the murals, which account for 60% of the total mural area.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of Mazu's deeds, the Ancient Culture Street Management Committee and Tianhou Palace in Nankai District of Tianjin City launched a project to restore the main hall of Tianhou Palace and the murals in the hall.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changkui, who invited four famous Chinese painters to participate.
The restoration work is based on the principle of 'repairing the old as the old'. At the same time, the original murals have been adjusted for local content, and the original imperfections of the murals have been supplemented and restored.
In the restoration, we have also made innovations and attempts in color, materials, pen and ink.
After the restoration, the style, spirituality, spirit and artistic style of the original murals were maintained.
Built in 1326, Tianhou Palace, formerly known as Tianfei Palace, commonly known as Niang Niang Palace, has been renovated many times. It is the oldest building complex in Tianjin and one of the earliest surviving Mazu temples in China.
On September 25, the launch ceremony of Beijing Daxing International Airport was held.
The shape of the terminal of Beijing Daxing International Airport means "Phoenix spreads its wings" and has been hailed as the first of the "Seven Wonders of the New World".
At present, Beijing Capital International Airport is already overstretched. Last year, it carried 100 million + passengers, making it the second airport in the world to handle more than 100 million passengers a year after Atlanta Airport in the United States.
It is expected that by 2022, the passenger throughput of Beijing Daxing International Airport will reach 45 million, accounting for 20% of international flights; by 2025, the passenger throughput will reach 72 million, and the share of international flights is expected to reach 30%.
As a "new country gate", how cool is it?
Beijing Daxing International Airport is located between Daxing District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Langfang City, Hebei Province. With a straight distance of 46 kilometers from Tiananmen, it is the largest new airport built in the world.
The roof-covered steel structure of its terminal has a projected floor area of 180,000 square meters and is the size of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the first terminal in the world to have two arrival floors and two departure floors-F1-F4 is international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure and international departure respectively.
Outside the terminal, there is a double-deck bridge connecting the high-speed and the airport, corresponding to the terminals F3 and F4, respectively-the upper level for international departures and both floors for domestic departures.
The first flight of Beijing Daxing International Airport opened the era of Beijing's "twin airports".
The new airport is positioned as a large international aviation hub, a new power source for the development of the country and an integrated transportation hub for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region that supports the construction of the Xiong'an New Area. So far, a total of 66 airlines are interested in entering Beijing Daxing International Airport, of which 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regional and foreign airlines have been approved at all times.
In the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes, covering 112 destinations worldwide, including 97 domestic destinations and 15 international destinations.
This has formed a "dual hub" airport pattern with Beijing Capital International Airport with coordinated development, moderate competition and international first-class competitiveness, which not only relieves the operating pressure of the capital airport's saturated capacity, but also better meets the urgent needs of the rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and surrounding areas, and effectively enhances the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport fully takes into account the geographical location, the relationship between the airport and the surrounding airspace and operating environment. For the first time in China, the airport runway has adopted an "all-directional" layout, adopted the world's largest air traffic control automation system, and established China's largest terminal control area, which can maximize the efficiency of aviation operation.
For the first time, domestic airports of this size have used a home-made automatic baggage handling and information management system, adopted an innovative baggage transmission mode, and improved the handling efficiency of the baggage system.
The first flight of Beijing Daxing International Airport heralds the dazzling and cool take-off of Phoenix.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic firsts and has a localization rate of more than 98%, will certainly have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industries in the surrounding areas and inject air-to-air vitality into Beijing's economic development.

Ma Hua is tentatively scheduled to hold a general meeting in November to transfer the party age to 16
Ma Hua is tentatively scheduled to hold the Central Congress in early November, and intends to amend the Party Constitution to lower the age of membership to 16.
With the approval of the National Assembly to lower the voting age for the general election, MCA announced that the 66th Central Congress, to be held this year, would put forward proposals to amend the Party Constitution, including lowering the age of MCA membership from the current 18 to 16.
MCA President Dato' Seri Wei Jiaxiang said that the MCA Central Committee was originally scheduled to hold the Central Congress on November 2 and 3 this year, but due to the by-election of Tanjung Biai's parliamentary seat, the date of the Congress may change.
He said that as the Election Committee will only meet on October 1 to finalize the nomination date and voting date for the by-election of Tanjung Biai, they will meet the following day, October 2, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of convening the Central Committee yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the congress and amend the Party Constitution, but happened to meet the unfortunate death of Dato' Mohamed Fali, a member of the National Assembly of the Indigenous Solidarity Party Tanjung Biai, and therefore joined the agenda of the by-election for this national seat.

Neonatal departments and other relays to save small lives.
Thrilling!
The second pregnant mother had an early attack. On the way to the hospital in a hurry, a 32-week-old premature baby could not wait to be born on her father's car co-driver.
Fortunately, obstetrics and newborn pediatricians dealt with it in time, and the relay saved this small life.
Coincidentally, on the 19th, 20th and 21st, the obstetrics and neonatal departments of Hubei Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital received three premature babies born on the road for three consecutive days. The other two were born on 120 emergency vehicles, both 29 weeks of premature babies.
Ms. Cheng is a second-child pregnant mother. At 7 am on September 19, she felt a little pain in her stomach. Thinking that she had been pregnant for 32 weeks and that the first child was also premature, she packed up the waiting items and was ready to go directly to the hospital after taking a bath.
After 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed up and asked her husband to drive from Xu Dong's home to the hospital.
I didn't expect that soon after the car left the house, the baby couldn't wait to be born on his father's car co-driver.
Twenty minutes later, Ms. Cheng and her baby finally arrived at the obstetrics and gynecology building of the Hubei Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital.
When the hospital security guard saw the flustered couple and baby, he immediately informed the maternity ward. Deputy chief physician Zhang Huan and four other doctors and midwife Liu Yanyan rushed downstairs with the delivery bag and umbilical cord plate.
"At that time, the mother was half lying on the deputy driver of the car, with amniotic fluid and blood water under her body. A baby boy was next to her and was still attached to her umbilical cord."
Zhang Huan inquired and learned that the baby was a 32-week-old premature baby. On the way, the parents did not have time to cover the package for the child. The morning of early autumn was already cool. His skin was pale with cold, he did not cry and his limbs were paralyzed.
Liu Yanyan hurried to the deputy driver to handle the umbilical cord for the baby. Zhang Huan got in from the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, wrapped several layers of warmth for the child with the treatment towel and the cloth of the delivery bag, cleaned the respiratory tract for the newborn (as shown in the picture), and then carried the baby to the neonatal department on the 12th floor.
After learning the news, the neonatal department immediately rushed to the nurse station to rescue the premature baby on the spot.
At that time, the baby's face was purple and there was suffocation and lack of oxygen. The doctor immediately gave him a tracheal intubation. In less than a minute, the baby regained his heartbeat, the skin color gradually returned to ruddy, and the recovery was successful.
After being admitted to the hospital, the 32-week-old baby had a wound breathing machine. After continuous rescue, his breathing was stable and he was successfully evacuated the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are stable, breathing is smooth, and a small amount of breastfeeding has begun.
Coincidentally, on the 19th, 20th and 21st, the obstetrics and neonatal department of the hospital received three premature babies born on the road for three consecutive days. The other two were born on the 120 emergency vehicle, both 29 weeks of premature babies, and are currently actively treated in the neonatal department.
Sun Guoqiang, director of the obstetrics department of the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital, introduced that in recent years, women and children in the province have received many babies born on the subway and in private cars. The poor handling of this situation may threaten the life safety of mothers and children.
Director Sun reminded that once pregnant mothers have abdominal pain, broken water, see red and other phenomena, they should come to the hospital immediately.
In case of childbirth at home or on the road, the mother should try to lie flat. She can put a blanket under her hips and so on to prevent the baby from hitting the ground after delivery. The child should keep warm immediately after delivery and be sent to the doctor as soon as possible.
Objective: To examine whether there are significant differences in working day/weekend sleep in patients with type II diabetes and whether intra-individual sleep differences are related to blood sugar control.
Design: related longitudinal design.
Methods: Data from February 2017 to January 2018 were collected.
A total of 56 adult patients with type II diabetes (60.7 years old, 55.4% female) participated in the study.
Use a cognitive sleep diary to record eight days of sleep.
Intra-individual sleep differences are calculated as standard deviations of sleep variables.
The standard deviations of sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep quality and average sleep time were calculated.
Blood glucose control was determined by hemoglobin A1C.
The pairing t test and multiple regression analysis were used.
Results: Overall, there was no difference in sleep parameters between working days and weekends.
The subjects slept 20 minutes more on weekends than on working days.
The average sleep time on weekends is about 35 minutes later than on working days.
The differences in sleep within individuals and the average sleep time range were 27.6-167.4 minutes and 13-137 minutes, respectively.
Covariant (such as depression, symptoms and self-care) control, large differences in sleep duration and average sleep time were significantly correlated with higher hemoglobin A1C levels.
Conclusion: It is recommended that diabetes educators consider assessing the differences in sleep within individuals.
During patient education, emphasis should be placed on maintaining regular sleep habits (such as sleep duration and sleep time).
Impact: Individual content sleep differences are another dimension of sleep assessment.
By recording a diary of eight days of sleep, the study examined whether intra-individual sleep variation in older patients with type II diabetes was related to blood sugar control.
The subjects had similar sleep patterns on working days and weekends.
Larger individuals' internal sleep differences and average sleep time were independently correlated with poor blood sugar control.
It is recommended that diabetics maintain regular sleep.
Vietnam new aviation technology company officially opens
The establishment of VSTEA is one of the details of the memorandum of cooperation signed by VAECO and ST Engineering Aerospace in April 2018, marking the advent of Vietnam's first aircraft equipment maintenance and repair joint venture.

In order to better meet the sustainable development needs of Vietnam's aviation industry.
Research shows that manufacturing industry has become the focus of attention of major countries around the world-Xinhua.com
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 27, a few days ago, the National Intellectual Property Operation Public Service Platform released the "White Paper on the Global Manufacturing Innovation Index" in Hefei, Anhui Province.
The white paper shows that manufacturing has become the focus of attention of major countries around the world.
This is what the reporter learned at the "Intellectual Property Operation and Protection Forum of the 2019 World Manufacturing Congress" held in Hefei.
The forum focused on intellectual property rights to help China's manufacturing upgrading. From the macro-level of policy interpretation and the micro-perspective of enterprise practice, it comprehensively explored innovative measures for the operation and protection of intellectual property rights in the manufacturing field, discussed in depth the hot topics of intellectual property protection in the manufacturing industry, continuously improved the ability of high-quality application of intellectual property rights and accelerated the construction of the advantages of intelligent upgrading in the manufacturing industry.
The forum invited scholars from the State Intellectual Property Office, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as experts from relevant domestic and foreign industry organizations and professional research institutions, to share experiences and offer suggestions on how to strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights and promote the use of intellectual property rights.
At the forum, the Anhui Provincial Market Supervision Administration released the report "Patent Navigation Anhui Provincial Innovation Development Quality Analysis and Evaluation". According to the results of the patent navigation regional innovation high-quality development index, Anhui Province's patent navigation regional innovation high-quality development index in 2018 ranked eighth out of 31 provinces, districts and cities in the country, and the innovation factor agglomeration index ranked fourth in the country.

The 2019 China Open competition opened today with a number of Olympic champions participating in the opening ceremony
Many Olympic champions will take part in the opening ceremony. The audience will sing "Me and My Fatherland" with the Junior Choir
The opening ceremony of the 2019 China Open Tennis Championships will officially begin today at the National Tennis Center. Before the opening match of the evening game, the organizing committee will hold a short and grand opening ceremony. A number of Olympic champions and well-known figures from the sports world will gather at the Diamond Stadium. The guests and spectators participating in the opening ceremony will sing "Me and My Fatherland" with the children of the Junior Choir.
In the next nine days, including the 11th Golden Week, Beijing will again usher in a tennis boom, and the National Tennis Center will become a good place for fans to spend their holidays.
Since its inception in 2004, the China Open has gone through 15 spring and autumn, and this year is the 16th time it has been held.
The total prize money for this year's China Nets tournament is also another record high, reaching US$11.16 million.
Among them, the total prize money of the women's crown tournament is US$7.64 million. Compared with the two crown tournaments of Indian Wells and Miami, the latter two women's singles tournaments are 96 signatures, while the middle net is 60 signatures, so for the players, the middle net competition appears to be more "cost-effective".
The total prize money of the men's ATP 500 tournament reached an all-time high, rising from US$3.4 million last year to US$3.52 million. The number of prize money continues to lead the ATP 500 tournament, while the total prize money of the ATP 500 tournament held in Tokyo in the same week was about US$2 million.
There will be a short and grand opening ceremony before the first game scheduled at the Central Stadium tonight.
In addition to the leaders and some players participating in tonight's opening ceremony, there will also be ten top players from all fields of Chinese sports, including Olympic champions and world champions.
The first match of the Central Stadium arranged after the opening ceremony was a WTA first round match between Chinese Golden Flower Peng Shuai and Russian Kasakina. The next second match was played by American rookie Sofia Kenning to challenge 2015 China Open women's singles champion Mugulazza, thus opening the 2019 China Open.
"The most beautiful unwed princess in the world" is engaged!
According to the British newspaper Metro, Buckingham Palace announced on the 26th that British Princess Beatrice and Mozzi were engaged.
It is reported that Mozzi is a 34-year-old Italian billionaire who mainly works in real estate development.
Beatrice will marry the real estate tycoon next year (2020).
Princess Beatrice is the granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II, the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York. She is ranked fifth in the order of heirs to the British throne and has been hailed as "the most beautiful unwed princess in the world".
The Duchess of York posted a photo of her daughter's engagement on the social network on the 26th and said: "We are very pleased to announce that Princess Beatrice and Mr. Mozzi are engaged."
The British said the two were engaged in Italy earlier this month.
The engagement was filmed by Beatrice's sister Eugenie.
'We are very happy to share the news of our engagement,' the couple said in a statement.
We are excited to be able to join hands on the journey of life. We can't wait to get married.
We have many similar interests and ideas, which will make us more stable, full of love and happiness in the years to come.
Up to three points for a free throw?
On the 27th of Beijing time, the NBA Development League announced the trial implementation of a new free throw rule. Each free throw will be played only once, and the score will be determined by the foul situation.
O'Neal has a low free throw percentage among NBA stars.
The new rules stipulate that a two-point shooting foul can score 2 points, a three-point shooting foul can score 3 points, and a foul plus penalty can score 1 point.
The last two minutes of regular time and extra time will follow the previous free throw rules.
Although this rule will only be tested in the NBA Development League in the new season, fans are more concerned about what impact it will have on current players if it is implemented in the NBA.
At present, many people believe that the new rules may be good for "Big Beard" Harden, while James, who has a relatively poor free throw, will "suffer".
Objective The research on the quality of life related to oral cancer is becoming more and more a focus issue in clinic. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the research status of the evaluation of the quality of life of patients with oral cancer at home and abroad, explore the problems existing in the research and the direction of future research, and provide reference for solving this problem.
Methods Pubmed, Wiley InterScience, Science Direct, China Knowledge Network and Wanfang Journal databases were retrieved through relevant keywords. Secondly, the relevant target literature from 2000 to 2017 was screened, the frequency of oral cancer-related quality of life scale used in the statistical literature was analyzed, and the relevant scale was briefly introduced.
Results A total of 218 English target documents and 55 Chinese target documents were screened from the target literature, and 24 English scale and 12 Chinese scale were obtained. Among them, the most used scale for the quality of life assessment of patients with oral cancer are the University of Washington Quality of Life Assessment Questionnaire (UW-QOL), the core scale of the European Cancer Research and Treatment Organization Quality of Life Scale/special scale for head and neck cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30/H&N35), oral health impact scale (OHIP), cancer treatment function evaluation system-head and neck questionnaire (FACT-H&N), 36 articles concise health status questionnaire (SF-36).
Conclusion In recent years, the research on the quality of life related to oral cancer has been in full swing, with a wide geographical distribution of research. However, the work of developing and developing the scale independently in China is still insufficient. UW-QOL, EORTC QLQ-C30/H&N35 and FACT-H&N can be used as the preferred scale for the evaluation of the quality of life of patients with oral cancer in the future. In addition, specific disease-related function scales can be selected according to specific research objectives.
Wuhan promotes the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises and gives a maximum subsidy of 20 million yuan
On the 27th, the reporter learned from the "Commendation of New China to Welcome the Military Games" city series conference held by the Information Office of the Wuhan Municipal Government that since this year, the city has accelerated the promotion of industrial intelligent transformation and implemented transformation subsidy measures of up to 20 million yuan.
Up to now, it has collected information on the intelligent transformation needs of more than 800 industrial enterprises above the scale.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of the Wuhan Economic and Informatization Bureau, introduced that since this year, Wuhan has launched an action plan for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, providing free consultation and diagnosis services and proposing solutions for industrial enterprises above the scale in need, and comprehensively promoting a new round of high-level enterprise technological transformation.
According to the plan, Wuhan publicly selects a number of specialized diagnostic service institutions every year to conduct a survey of intelligent transformation needs for all industrial enterprises above the size of the city through the opening of columns, questionnaires and door-to-door filings.
So far, it has collected information on the intelligent transformation needs of more than 800 industrial enterprises under the regulations, accounting for nearly one third of the number of industrial enterprises above the size of the city.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to enter enterprises in batches to carry out "one-on-one" on-site evaluation and program demonstration.
Zhang Hong introduced that at present, the city is organizing and implementing 373 intelligent transformation projects, with a total planned investment of 29.76 billion yuan. Hongxin Communications China's first 5G intelligent production line, Motorola's national leading intelligent mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens Transformer Digital Unmanned Factory, Aerospace Science and Technology's first batch satellite production line, Huisheng Biological World's leading new animal medicine intelligent production line, Eurobon Smart Home Network intelligent production line and other leading intelligent workshops and intelligent factories in the industry have been launched.
In addition, Wuhan has also increased financial support for intelligent transformation projects.
Among them, those who implement the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises shall complete the investment according to their actual conditions; including the investment in equipment and hardware and the soft investment in research and development, they shall be given a transformation subsidy of 8%, up to 20 million yuan.
At the same time, we will actively work with financial institutions such as Jiaotong Bank and Wuhan Branch of Zhejiang Commercial Bank to provide personalized financial services specifically for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, and vigorously alleviate the financing pressure of enterprises.
Trudeau "collapsed", can he succeed in re-election
This time, the "big pit" that tripped Trudeau out of a row was dug out by Trudeau himself.
Recently, the Canadian media revealed a number of old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau disguised himself as a black image.
This was considered an obvious act of racial discrimination and immediately caused an uproar in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians do not buy much.
Trudeau lifted a stone and threw it at his own feet.
As political commentator Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-black face movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile accusing the opposition or dissidents in their own party of "losing money" in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened that "whoever makes this mistake should be dismissed immediately".
In short, the "big pit" that tripped Trudeau out of a row this time was dug out by Trudeau himself.
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He is young and handsome. When he first made his debut, there was a whirlwind of "political idols".
Originally a "political man", after taking over as leader of the Federal Liberal Party, he fought an unexpected and beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative election-the Federal Liberal Party won more than half of the seats in the lower house of the Federation and won the valuable right to form a separate government.
At that time, Trudeau put forward many deafening political platforms and ideas, such as "ethnicity and gender equality", "ecological environmental protection", "economic revitalization", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "wrongdoing".
However, in his five years in power, he has been "high and low" in almost all the above-mentioned aspects.
Consider the issue of "ethnicity and gender equality", leaving aside the "black face" incident, after he "paid lip service" on a series of issues related to Aboriginal people, leading Aboriginal groups and leaders to move protest tents to the gate of Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada.
With regard to eradicating corruption, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, Trudeau was involved in the raging "Lan Wanling Incident".
It was revealed that he put pressure on the departments and officials responsible for investigation and punishment for the major irregularities and malpractices of "Lan Wanling", a construction engineering company in his hometown, and asked the latter to "go out of business".
Moreover, Trudeau became angry with the official who disclosed the malpractice case after the incident. Wang Zhoudi, mentioned earlier, was the then Attorney General of Canada who was the first to disclose the malpractice case and directly handled the case.
Although the case itself still has doubts, its suspicion is difficult to wash away.
Many observers pointed out that the collapse of Trudeau's five years in power was mainly caused by his own "planing pits", while the biggest "pits" were "tiger heads and tails", "self-inflicted consequences" and "more lenient than self-discipline and stricter than discipline".
According to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll, since 2015, the number of respondents who support Trudeau has slipped from more than 60% to more than 30%, while the number of opponents has soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have also performed poorly, even a significant number of voters who still want to vote for the Federal Liberal Party now disapprove of the federal prime minister and the leader of the ruling party.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin. Can Trudeau repeat the drama that won a great victory five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the extracellular surface (cell membrane) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
By reducing the content of angiotensin II and increasing the content of Ang (1-7) to inhibit the activity of related angiotensin-converting Enzyme (ACE), ACE2 is expected to become a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point for some coronaviruses into cells.
The human version of this enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal Collectrin kidney amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein whose enzyme-active domain is exposed to the cell surface of the lungs and other tissues.
Another enzyme, known as sheddase, cracks the extracellular domain of ACE2 from the transmembrane domain, producing soluble proteins that are released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane, mainly type II alveolar cells in the lungs, intestinal epithelial cells in the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells in most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression has also been found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to counterbalance ACE.
ACE cracks angiotensin I into angiotensin II with vasoconstriction activity.
ACE2 then cracks the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin with vasodilation activity (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also crack many other peptides, including dearginine 9-retarded peptide, apelin, neurohypertensin, morphine A and gastric hunger hormone.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronaviruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 thorny protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 binds to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface, leading to endocytosis, causing the virus and enzyme to co-transpose into the nuclear inner body in the cell.
This entry process also requires the activation of S protein by host serine protease TMPRSS2. The inhibition of this process is currently being studied as a potential treatment. Some speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators recommend the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group".
Moreover, "for patients with a high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, the use of ACE inhibitors will also reduce the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but the results are not as reliable as reducing the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new method for the treatment of acute lung injury. It seems to improve the pulmonary hemodynamic index and blood oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipid polysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, the effective time is 30 minutes, and the action process (duration) is 24 hours.
Some studies have shown that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance of the classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor or for diseases with elevated levels of circulating angiotensin II. The efficacy of rhACE2 infusion in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, the level of consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, it has far-reaching influence and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened.
The Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission that the Capital Airport is already in a state of supersaturated operation. The opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the capital's aviation service capacity.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city in China to have two airports in the same city. It is similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, and Pudong Airport, which is dominated by international shipping aviation. In the future, Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also provide more subdivided services based on the differentiated positioning of serving different domestic and international aviation operations.
The opening of Daxing Airport, from the point of view of business development, is more of a positive impact on the Capital Airport.
In 2018, Capital Airport handled more than 100 million passengers, ranking first in the country. However, compared with the rapidly growing business demand, there is still a significant capacity gap, especially in the demand for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for tourism and business travel, and to adapt to the urban development trend of Beijing's increasing openness and international integration, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport. It plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers and cargo and mail throughput of 4 million tons in the future.
Therefore, the positioning of the two airports does not overlap, targeting different customer groups, and both have sufficient market space.
From the point of view of economic accounts, the opening of Daxing International Airport will obviously form a win-win effect, ease the tight situation of Beijing's aviation capacity, accelerate the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput, and create an incremental cake for the dual-core operation of Capital Airlines.
Discovery: Five main themes: vicious circle and second chance, getting rid of the disease, difficult but achievable, worthwhile, related to the medical health team.
Conclusion: the research results provide people with the complex nature of receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease from the perspective of recipients and donors.
Impact: If health care workers understand the transplant experience of recipients and donors, it will help them improve home care.
Home care can not only guarantee the health of patients but also guarantee the quality of life.
Understanding the patient's transplant experience, transplant value and patient preferences is helpful to provide high-quality clinical treatment and efficient communication, and promote decision-making.
Future research will be used to assess the family experience of informed choice of the person to be transplanted.

2019 Vietnam economic and social issues Forum held in Chengtianshunhua province
Nguyen Dejian, deputy director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, revealed that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new improvements and continued to maintain the growth trend.
The forum focused on the outstanding economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants had an in-depth exchange of views and views on four topics, including the economic development in 2019 and the impact of some FTAs, some outstanding issues in Vietnam's economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnam's social culture in 2019, and predictions and suggestions for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally agreed that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth slowed and risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has determined that, despite the uncertainty of the global economy, in which 70% of the world's economies are in a state of stagnant growth, Vietnam's economic development has made many welcome achievements. The macro-economy is running smoothly and inflation has been effectively controlled. The consumer price index increased by an average of 2.64% in the first half of 2019, the lowest increase in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76% in the first half of 2019. Although it was lower than 7.05% in the same period last year, the increase is still a high level compared with the level of the same period in the period 2011-2017.
When predicting the economic development trend of Vietnam in 2019-2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of the National Economic and Social Forecasting Center of Vietnam, said that under the background of the world economic turmoil, Vietnam's economy showed a high growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro-economy will remain basically stable. The implementation of various free trade agreements will boost trade development. The work of economic restructuring and improving the business environment will be further strengthened. Due to the impact of trade friction, Vietnam's foreign export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring, forecasting and early warning mechanism, take the initiative to find trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, find opportunities to expand new export markets, and create facilities for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, the inflation rate will be kept at a reasonable level, so as to promote the development of auxiliary industries and support the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.
Objective To study the effect of different sandblasting conditions on the binding strength of cobalt-chromium alloy and porcelain made by selective laser cladding technology (SLM).
Methods 63 10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm cobalt-chromium alloy specimens were prepared by SLM technology. They were randomly divided into 9 groups (n = 7) and sandblasting was carried out with different Al2O3 particle size (A1 = 50 μm, A2 = 100 μm, A3 = 150 μm) and different pressure (B1 = 0.2 MPa, B2 = 0.4 MPa, B3 = 0.6 MPa).
Each group randomly selected one specimen for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. After the remaining specimens were porcelaind, the gold-porcelain binding strength of the specimen was determined by a universal test machine and its fracture mode was observed. The data were analyzed by SPSS 17.0 software.
Results The shear strengths of groups A1B1, A1B2, A1B3, A2B1, A2B2, A2B3, A3B1, A3B2 and A3B3 were (27.22 ± 0.95), (27.58 ± 0.47), (26.80 ± 0.71), (27.54 ± 0.78), (30.75 ± 0.43), (26.93 ± 0.88), (28.18 ± 0.93), (29.55 ± 0.57), (28.11 ± 0.91).
The difference of shear strength between sandblasting groups with different particle size Al2O3 is statistically significant (P < 0.05), the difference of shear strength between sandblasting groups with different pressure is statistically significant (P < 0.05), and different particles and different pressure have an interaction on the size of shear strength (P < 0.05).
After the shear experiment, all the specimens were mixed fracture mode.
Conclusion Under the conditions of this experiment, SLM cobalt-chromium alloy has the greatest binding strength of gold and porcelain after sandblasting of 0.4 MPa and 100 μm Al2O3 particles.
Title
Establishment and clinical application of flow microsphere technology to detect plasma vWF antigen.
Purpose
To establish a method of flow microsphere technology (FCIA) to detect plasma vWF antigen (vWF: Ag) and explore its value in predicting the long-term prognosis of patients with ischemic stroke.
Methodology
The plasma vWF was captured by the microspheres of the anti-human vWF monoclonal antibody SZ29 IgG, then incubated with the FITC-labeled sheep anti-human vWF IgG polyclonal antibody. At the end, it was detected and analyzed on a flow cytometer.
Twenty-one patients with vascular hemophilia and 105 healthy control patients used FCIA method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect plasma vWF: Ag at the same time for inter-methodological evaluation.
The FCIA method was used to detect the initial vWF: Ag level of 61 stroke patients and follow up the prognosis of 2 years.
Results
The FCIA method for detecting plasma vWF: Ag has a better standard curve fitting (R2 = 0.99), and the difference with ELISA is not statistically significant.
According to the Bland-Altman consistency test, the bias of the two methods is 1.12%, and the 95% consistency limit is (-45.06%, 47.30%). After linear regression analysis, the FCIA method has a good correlation with the ELISA method (slope = 0.97, r = 0.86, P < 0.0001), and it takes a short time and has a higher sensitivity.
Compared with the control group, the vWF: Ag, vWF: GPIbR and vWF collagen binding activity in stroke patients increased significantly (Z values were 8.36, 8.71, 6.22, P < 0.01, respectively).
VWF: Ag is negatively correlated with the improved Barthel index score (r = -0.31, P < 0.05) and has no correlation with the improved Rankin score.
Conclusion
Flow microsphere technology to detect vWF: Ag is not only an effective complement to the ELISA method, but also fast and sensitive, improving the diagnosis of type 3 vascular hemophilia.
Patients with stroke vWF: the increase of Ag level indicates poor recovery of daily activity ability for 2 years and poor long-term prognosis.
Liu Zhijie, Director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on the 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu Zhijie said that in the 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programs to improve global economic governance and promote common global development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and also brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being.
Liu Zhijie said that as the world's second largest economy, China's contribution rate to world economic growth exceeds 30%. In particular, China's "Belt and Road" initiative, the cooperation between China's local provinces and cities and Siem Reap and the provinces in the territorial region has been deepening.
He said that this year is the opening year of the 61 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia. The two countries have fraternal friendship, and the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Cambodia will become the driving force for the local economic and social development.
Siem Reap Governor Di Saiha highly praised the great achievements made by New China in the past 70 years and congratulated China and Cambodia on the achievements of friendly cooperation between the two countries.
Di Saiha expects the two sides to continue to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve people's living standards.
Di Saiha said that the friendly exchanges between Siem Reap Province and various provinces and cities in China have been remarkable. So far, friendly relations have been concluded with 28 provinces and cities in China. The large-scale cultural and performing arts projects "Angkor Smile" and "Angkor Dynasty" have landed. The Siem Reap-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siem Renewal International Airport Project, the special training course for officials of Siem Reap Provincial Government, the Siem Residence Scholars' Scholarship to Study in China, the rural rehabilitation, the reconstruction of urban roads and the rehabilitation of cataracts.
The reception was attended by Ken Wensong, State Secretary of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Weng Heng, Chairman of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the Governors of the five provinces in the territorial region, the Siem Reap Branch of the Cambodian-Chinese Council, volunteer teachers, the Siem Reap Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, representatives of Chinese enterprises and representatives of foreign consular missions in Siem Reap.
Witnessing the Ten-Year "Cloud Rise" of Digital China in Yunqi Town-Xinhua.com
If the 2009 local website forum is taken as the starting point, the 2019 Yunqi Congress held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has passed a full decade.
From the concept of "in the clouds" to the practice of "in the clouds", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management and public services in the past 10 years.
In the Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, recently there was a new "colleague" with Ali Yun artificial intelligence next to the quality inspector.
It is 24-hour, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manual, and the quality inspection accuracy rate is stable at more than 95%.
According to the person in charge of the company, the "quality inspector" with a camera has focused on learning more than 40,000 defective samples. With the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and classify and place defective battery tablets.
This enterprise is just a microcosm of today's cloud computing-aided manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Informatization issued the "Implementation Guide for Promoting Enterprises on the Cloud (2018-2020)", which proposed to strive to achieve a marked increase in the awareness and enthusiasm of enterprises on the cloud by 2020, with a significant increase in the proportion of enterprises on the cloud and the depth of application.
Wang Jian, founder of Ali Yun, said that today, data-centered cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way for a digital economy in which data is a key element.
At the same time, over the past 10 years, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has also been expanding.
According to the White Paper on the Development of Cloud Computing (2019) released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, the overall market size of cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and the development of digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also unwittingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Yunqi Congress, the "urban brain", which has appeared for three consecutive years, is still attracting attention.
Ali Yun introduced that at present, the urban brain has become the center of urban management from traffic management tools, and the related cooperative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception and artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain, through its powerful computing power, can realize the functions of new urban management services such as "parking first and paying later", "real-time perception of the number of visits" and "tourism route design".
In the field of government services, "one thing" is docked with "one cloud", and "hand-held office" and "hand-held office" are promoted together. Cloud computing has brought convenience to both ends of the supply of government services.
At present, through government affairs, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform for the whole province.
As of September 11, this platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million corporate units in the province, bringing together 3,066 categories of 19.08 billion data.
The average number of calls and sharing of data between government departments in Zhejiang Province has reached 12 million per month. Every additional call flow of data on the 'cloud' may mean that the masses do less errands.
Objective To investigate the clinical characteristics and treatment of congenital submandibular gland catheter dilatation.
Methods From January 2008 to March 2018, a total of 7 children with congenital submandibular gland catheter dilation were treated, with an average age of 22 days in May.
All seven children underwent lateral sublingual gland gland resection, submandibular gland dilatation partial catheter resection and catheter diversion under general anesthesia. During the operation, the submandibular gland catheter mouth was narrowed and some catheters were dilated.
Results All 7 patients had good healing after operation. There was no swelling or cyst.
Conclusion Children with congenital submandibular gland catheter dilatation occur at a young age. Early diagnosis and treatment are helpful to prevent the aggravation of catheter dilatation, avoid gland atrophy, feeding difficulties and obstructing breathing. Simultaneous resection of sublingual gland glands can avoid the occurrence of sublingual gland cysts after operation.
Be careful to make tea with plastic tea bags!
According to the "Central News Agency", recently, a new Canadian study found that a package of plastic tea bags may release billions or even tens of billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics a person consumes throughout the year, but so far there is no evidence that ingesting plastic particles can pose a threat to humans.
It is reported that researchers at Magill University in Canada found that by immersing plastic tea bags in a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius), tea bags will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nano-plastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics a person consumes throughout the year.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year and inhales the same amount of microplastics at the same time.
It is reported that the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology. The researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and cafes, opened the tea bags, washed the tea bags and immersed them in almost boiling water for five minutes, and then analyzed them with electron microscopy and spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "several orders of magnitude higher than the plastic load of other foods before."
Most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many brands of tea bags made of natural fibers still use plastic to seal their mouths, the report said.
Some brands of tea bags are no longer made of paper, but instead use plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the subject of testing by researchers.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastics. The researchers defined these microplastics as between 100 nm and 5 mm in size, mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world. These microplastics can also be found in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first found plastic particles in human excreta samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea bags, the Canadian team put water fleas into contaminated water and found that microplastics could affect the behavior of the fleas and cause them to develop abnormalities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), so far there is no evidence that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO points out that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what impact they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that the large amount of plastic particles released by these tea bags may be due to the fact that these plastic tea bags come into contact with boiling water. Even when "food grade" plastics are heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius, they may break down or seep out toxic substances.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island states.
There, a natural disaster can erode a generation's development gains.
This is illustrated by the disasters in Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes since this year.
About a quarter of the people in small island developing States live at an altitude of 5 meters or less.
Relocation can seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, small island countries jointly committed themselves to achieving carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030, so that they once again lead the world in the right direction.
"The climate crisis is putting new injustices on top of old ones," Guterres said.
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are still trapped in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States."
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; and urging international agencies to help small island developing States, especially heavily indebted middle-income countries, access funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the "sweeping" severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, some extreme sea-level rise that would have occurred only once in a century may occur every year in many regions.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused huge losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decline in resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, making them subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security impact of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
"By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved anywhere," Guterres said.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples for the world to learn from."
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
Using the epidemic data of the new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) published on the official website of the Health and Health Committees of various cities in Anhui Province, the spatial and temporal distribution map of the number of confirmed cases in Anhui Province is drawn, the population growth curve is used to match the epidemic change curve of different stages in Anhui Province, and the epidemic situation in the whole province and various cities is statistically described and analyzed.
As of February 18, 2020, the cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 in Anhui Province was 1.56/100,000. Moreover, Anhui Province reported that the COVID-19 epidemic showed a downward trend after February 7, and changed from the J-shaped curve to the S-shaped curve. As the reporting time of cases may be 3-5 d later than the actual incidence time, the number of new cases in Anhui Province actually began to decline between February 2 and February 4, 2020.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is fully liquid.
Indian Finance Minister Sitaraman said on the 26th that the current financial system is fully liquid. Driven by holiday consumption demand, India's economic growth rate is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year.
Sitaraman made the remarks after a meeting with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and other institutions in India.
Sitaraman did not say what the remarks were about.
Previously, some Indian and overseas media attributed the continued slowdown of India's current economy to the tight liquidity of non-bank financial institutions.
Taking the decline in car sales as an example, Sitaraman denied that tight liquidity was the main reason for the decline in sales.
Sitaraman pointed out that the decline in car sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Sitaraman predicts that India's economic growth may recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and will last until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly boost India's economic growth.
The Education Department of Jiangxi Province recently issued a notice that all primary and secondary schools in the province are strictly prohibited from making up classes illegally during the National Day holiday, and will organize personnel to conduct random inspections and covert visits.
In the circular issued on the strict prohibition of illegal remedial classes during the National Day holiday, the Education Department of Jiangxi Province stressed that primary and secondary schools everywhere should resolutely do so during the National Day period: they should not organize students to make up classes collectively or take new classes, they should not hold subject training courses, special classes, Olympic classes, interest classes, promotion classes, etc., and they should not rent campuses and school buildings to other educational institutions to hold various training courses.
At the same time, in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from organizing, recommending and inducing students to participate in illegal remedial classes inside and outside the school, in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from participating in illegal remedial classes organized by out-of-school training institutions or by other teachers, parents, parents' committees, etc., and in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from introducing students and providing relevant information to out-of-school training institutions and others.
The notice makes it clear that for the verified illegal remedial behavior of primary and secondary schools, the local education administrative department will increase the deduction points in the high-quality development education assessment of the county-level government that year; for teachers involved in illegal remedial classes, they will be seriously dealt with in accordance with the relevant regulations on teacher ethics.
Support pig production and ensure market supply
Sui's loyalty requires the implementation of various measures from six aspects
The province-wide teleconference on promoting pig production and guaranteeing market supply was held today to mobilize and re-deploy on the implementation of the policies and measures of the Central Committee, the provincial committee and the provincial government on supporting pig production and guaranteeing market supply.
Sui's loyalty requires that all measures for pig production be implemented from six aspects.
The "vegetable basket" mayor's responsibility system has been implemented. This year, the province's clear task of releasing 45 million pigs has been broken down into cities and states and included in the responsibility system assessment.
We will do a good job in implementing various policies and measures and effectively solve the "last kilometer" problem of policy implementation.
We will do a good job in the production and implementation of able-to-breed sows, earnestly implement the subsidy policy for good-breeding of able-to-breed sows, encourage pig-growing enterprises to expand the scale of pig breeding, and systematically select excellent sows from the commercial pig population.
We will do a good job in attracting investment and take the well-known domestic large-scale aquaculture enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the top priority in attracting investment.
We will do a good job in implementing the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for pigs, and comprehensively promote the transformation from "adjusting pigs" to "adjusting meat".
To implement the modern epidemic prevention system, all localities should be equipped with grass-roots epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel commensurate with the scale of breeding and work tasks, and build the first line of prevention and control of epidemic diseases.
Sui's loyalty requires that all efforts be made to guarantee the meat market supply, ensure that there are no large-scale shortages and large-scale supply cuts, and ensure that the pork market supply is stable on major holidays.
The meeting also made arrangements for the continuous prevention and control of the African swine fever epidemic, the prohibition of arrest and withdrawal of important waters in the Yangtze River basin of our province, and the acquisition of middle and late rice in the province.
Talking about the feelings of the motherland, the national soul, the Great White Rabbit and other representatives of Shanghai's old names attended party classes for college students
"Me and my motherland" campus card points make college students "happy".
On the occasion of celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Shanghai-made soap, Shao Wansheng, the Great White Rabbit and four famous Shanghai old names gathered at the "Art Party Course" of East China University of Technology on the 27th. Four representatives of Shanghai old names with an average history of more than 90 years, Qiqi told more than 200 young students about the motherland and national soul of the old name brand.
The product display exhibition of old-name brands at the scene.
The affectionate narration in the classroom made the students sigh that they did not expect that the product display exhibition of old-name brands was carefully arranged outside the classroom, and the "Me and My Fatherland" campus card point made the college students "happy".
White Rabbit lip balm, White Rabbit ice cream... As an old-name brand, White Rabbit Milk Sugar has been actively seeking change in recent years, taking the initiative, adhering to innovation and cross-border.
The Great White Rabbit, born in 1959, coincides with its 60th birthday this year.
Shao Wansheng also turned his attention to the youth consumer group.
Wang Weijie, secretary and deputy general manager of the Party branch of Shanghai Shao Wansheng Food Co. Ltd., mentioned the scene of "eating abalone in spring, eating bad fish in hot summer, eating drunk shrimp in the autumn wind and drinking crabs in the winter clouds", reflecting people's continuous innovation in "eating".
The company also further excavates brand culture from the aspects of taste innovation and comic packaging design in order to adapt to the inheritance of the younger generation of consumer groups.
The representative of the old name told the way of innovation on the spot in the "Art Party Course".
Yu Jie, manager of the restaurant company, said, "All innovations are inseparable from a solid foundation. Every innovation of the old name is a thick and thin process.
The expectation of the old name is hidden in everyone's heart.
The era of product-centered, small and beautiful should begin."
As one of the first batch of "old Chinese names" in China, Shanghai seafood has also quickly adapted to the market trend, carried out VI visual upgrading of the brand, introduced professional operation teams, and achieved a significant increase in turnover.
"Old names can not only be seen in these traditional channels such as supermarkets, but now old names will also actively participate in new retail and various activities.
All our changes will ultimately serve the purpose of enabling consumers to see, hear and, ultimately, buy."
Said Ouyang Yiling, deputy general manager of Shanghai soap (Group) Co. Ltd.
In the future, Shanghai soap will also adhere to high-end development, systematically develop energy-saving and environmentally friendly products with broad prospects and user satisfaction, and adhere to the path of high-tech content and high economic benefits.
Through this art party class, the students have gained a lot.
The old name accompanied my growth and carried the beautiful memories and emotions of my childhood."
Song Yiyuan students sighed.
The representative of the old name in Shanghai told more than 200 young students about the motherland and national soul of the old name brand.
Zhou Yiting said that how to excavate brand culture and let high-quality traditional culture be passed on from generation to generation and live forever is a problem that we, as design students, need to think about and explore.
Based on the "Shanghai Image" project of Ding Wei, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of East China University of Technology, and Professor Ni Jun's "Old Name Integrated Brand Innovation Studio", this party course hopes to deeply tap the cultural potential and modern commercial value of old names, make good use of the competitiveness and influence of old names in Shanghai, enhance the cultural radiation agglomeration power of old names in Shanghai, realize the industrial effect of "1 + 1 > 2" in the form of "design + culture", and show Shanghai culture from a new perspective.
It is reported that the "Art Party Course" will also continue to invite literary historians, masters of painting, masters of pottery, masters of non-relics, masters of architecture and masters of landscapes to serve as lecturers. Through them, they will talk about the innovation and adherence of inheriting Chinese culture, highlight the characteristics of the times, further strengthen the ideals and beliefs of college students and nurture the patriotic feelings of college students.
AIDS (AIDS) is a kind of infectious disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that is extremely infectious, spreads rapidly and has a high mortality rate. It is a difficult problem in China's public health and the prevention and control of infectious diseases.
The characteristics of oral diagnosis and treatment work make oral medical institutions/stomatology a key department for HIV/AIDS occupational exposure, and medical personnel face a high risk of HIV/AIDS occupational exposure.

On 26th local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China by video.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, everyone. I'm Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Government and people of Japan.
At the G-20 Osaka Summit held in June, Japan and China cooperated to make the summit a success and declared the firm will of the G-20 to the world through the Declaration of the G-20 Leaders Osaka Summit.
In addition, at the Japan-China summit talks and dinner before the summit, the two sides agreed that President Xi Jinping would pay a state visit to Japan next spring. At the same time, they were united in their determination to open up a new era between Japan and China.
Japan and China share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that the joint efforts of the two countries to deal with the problems facing the region and the world and jointly contribute to the international community will be conducive to building a new model of future relations between the two countries.
Finally, I wish Japan-China relations a vigorous development and my friends a prosperous career.
"Over-age migrant workers on some construction sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where can I find a young worker now?
I don't want to use so many 'old people' on the construction site. There is no way."
Recently, with regard to the phenomenon of many over-age migrant workers (over retirement age) on the construction site, Zou Kui, who has been working as an engineering contractor in the construction industry for many years, lamented.
Recently, the author's university carried out the rain and sewage diversion project. There are many migrant workers on campus. If you pay attention to the observation, you will find that there are many over-age migrant workers here.
Over-age migrant workers are not "idle" when they go out to work, but because they "cannot be idle" and have the helplessness and hardship of "having to do so"-whether saving money to solve their old-age and medical problems or helping their children, all drive these old people who should have been "idle" to continue to work hard.
The "old and dependent" of over-age migrant workers is not as easy as we think.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, providing for children to read books, helping children to build buildings and buy cars, helping children to start a family and raise grandchildren from generation to generation. When these migrant workers have completed the "task of life", their wallets have been emptied and even there are many debts, most of which lack the accumulation of wealth.
In order not to drag down their children and to save more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "working until they can't do it".
Many "post-80", "post-90" and even "post-00" new-generation migrant workers are reluctant to engage in secondary industries or low-end service industries with difficult conditions and high labor intensity, resulting in a structural "labor shortage". These unattractive jobs provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of a skill and the decline of physical function and labor ability, many over-age migrant workers are engaged in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk and low-security jobs.
Being able to work a day is a day. Being able to earn a little more is a bit. The survival predicament of over-age migrant workers behind "can't be idle" cannot be ignored and ignored.
To solve the difficult problems of wage arrears and wage collection, improve labor protection, reduce safety risks, increase labor income and improve the living conditions of over-age migrant workers. In addition to their "self-redemption", they are also inseparable from the institutional protection and humanistic care of the public sector.
Some scholars point out that over-age migrant workers are unlikely to rely on returning home to plant land to solve their old-age and medical problems. They must support their families through other means.
Reading the helplessness and strength of over-age migrant workers "can't be idle" will help us better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the back of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs and trying to make them return to the countryside to truly realize "old and dependent", it is necessary for the public sector, the market and society to share responsibilities in the benign interaction and for many parties to work together.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export the system in the next five years because "it will first supply its own military and then export production".
This practice is fully in line with international practice.
Major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their defense needs first before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Glekhov, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air and Space Forces, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by "Diamond-Antai" Sky Defense Conzern.
This is a new generation of air defense systems, using the working principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some data, the S-500 can also destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles exceeding five times the speed of sound, and even targets in near space.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a national defense perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian military also needs it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system entered service with the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.
According to the news on September 15, the modification of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the Arctic Air Defense Regiment of Novaya Zemlya has been completed.
This is not Russia's militarization in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the transition plan to more advanced defense tools in the strategic direction of the north.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic region has increased significantly," the news service of the Russian North Fleet said.
It is very important that, according to the military assessment, the system has been used successfully in the far north and the Arctic.
Officers and soldiers of the Air Defense Regiment trained on the new system and were ready to enter combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, it still retains part of it.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons that can destroy all kinds of air targets, whether they are targets flying at high speed at outer altitudes or "leaky fish" close to protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 "Triumph" system, developed by "Golden Diamond-Antai" Sky Defense Conzern, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other air attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 kilometers per second at a distance of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defense forces in the far north to ensure the security of its airspace along the northern sea route.
Not long ago, the first 12 "Tor"-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic. They are enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic.
At that time, the Russian Ministry of Defence said that the Arctic "Tor" force would be expanded to a complete brigade-level establishment in the future.
Together with the newly deployed S-400 long-range system on Novaya Zemlya and the Kola Peninsula and the "Pantsir-SA" short-range system deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons effectively defend Russia's polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defense.
According to the idea of the Russian government, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods, avoiding the complex and long process of opening their own stores.
As the operator of Russian goods stores, Russian goods companies focus on selling Russian goods in China.
Most Russian products have online stores in China's largest trading platforms such as Tian Cat (Tmall), Jingdong (JD), 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q (ShouQ) and multifunctional instant messaging software Wechat, as well as their own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian commodity retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russian products to formulate store marketing strategies and participation standards, and screen virtual shelf-on-shelf products enterprises.
The store plans to open by the end of this year and put on the shelves the products of at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, the total number of visits to China's e-commerce platform is as high as 1 billion per month.
At the same time, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, exceeding $1 billion in 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open a pilot store to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the global import strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display the goods of enterprises with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and the sales of 500 million rubles are still insignificant.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a fairly positive attitude towards Russian goods and regard our goods as high-quality and green environmentally friendly products."
Kozhevnikov said the competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying.
"We have an ambitious goal of launching 500 businesses through this store in three years," he said.
At the same time, the platform will also mount the products of enterprises in the Russian Far East.
"This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export center is a state-owned rather than a private institution," said Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor in the Department of Trade Policy Foundations at Russia's Plekhanov University of Economics.
"I don't see a lot of highly competitive Russian goods on the market."
He believes that the project will probably not really be implemented, but it will help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of more than 170 Russian enterprises has been published on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be purchased in both China and other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, namely the training program for Russian enterprises by experts from Taobao University, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
At the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year, the Russian Export Center will also act as an organizer for Russian enterprises to participate in industry exhibitions and commercial projects.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also become a center for holding commercial project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, promotion meetings and talks with representatives of Chinese enterprises.
At present, about 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
"In addition to the agricultural exhibition stand, we will certainly hold business meetings, that is, arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs," said the Information Service of the Russian Export Center.
"This is another direction of our efforts, with the aim of supporting enterprises and ensuring that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them."
In addition, the fair will also host master classes, cooking contests and a Russian food taste fair for famous Russian chefs in the "Shanghai Station for Exploring Russian Food" project.
The new type of coronavirus pneumonia has caused great losses to the life, health and economic property of our people.
Under such a special situation, how to deal with patients with aortic emergencies has become a serious challenge.
The rapid diagnosis of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia, the safe and effective transfer of patients, the implementation of interventional surgery for patients with combined pneumonia, the protection of vascular surgery medical teams, and the post-operative management and follow-up of patients have all become urgent problems for vascular surgeons to solve.
Combined with the latest national policies, literature reports and the experience of individual units in supporting the prevention and control of Wuhan, this paper briefly expounds the above-mentioned issues. It is hoped that it will trigger the thinking of vascular surgeons all over the country on how to implement the diagnosis and treatment of critical and even routine vascular diseases in vascular surgery under the new crown pneumonia epidemic, jointly deal with the epidemic, and minimize the damage of the epidemic to the greatest extent possible.
After the autopsy court of Mohamed Adi, who died in the line of duty, ruled on Friday that the cause of death was not accidental, the police waited for a complete report and for instructions from the General Prosecutor's Office to take the next step.
Datuk Huzl of the National Police Criminal Investigation Bureau issued a statement on Friday that, according to the decision of the coroner's court, the police will await the most further instructions from the General Prosecutor's Office.
In his statement, he stressed that the police had never terminated the investigation into the death of Mohamed and that the investigation was still ongoing.
On the other hand, Xuezhou Chief Superintendent Noah Zhan said that the police will wait for a complete report on the content of the relevant ruling before taking action.
He responded when asked about the matter after attending a handover ceremony for the deputy sheriff of Xuezhou at the Xuezhou police headquarters on Friday morning.
He said that the police investigated the case on the basis of the relevant reports.
He added that the police would also ignore the progress of the investigation and decide whether to summon people who had previously been recorded for questioning again.
The reporter learned from the Beijing Landscape and Greening Bureau that, in order to welcome the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China, Beijing has recently taken Chang'an Street and its routes as the main axis to comprehensively improve the landscaping landscape and create a peaceful and festive atmosphere.
At present, all 12 three-dimensional flower beds along Chang'an Street have been completed and unveiled. The city's 20 million pots of flowers dress up as the capital and dress up to welcome the arrival of the National Day holiday.
Over the past few days, 12 colorful and diverse three-dimensional flower bed landscapes along Chang'an Street have attracted many citizens and tourists to watch and take pictures.
These flower beds have a bright theme. From the beginning of the "magnificent 70 years" in the northwest corner of Jianguomen to the end of the "beautiful tomorrow" in the northeast corner of Fuxingmen, they bring together the brilliant achievements made in various fields in the 70 years since the founding of New China and show the happy life of the people.
The relevant person-in-charge of the Beijing Landscape and Greening Bureau introduced that this year's greening environment layout makes full use of its own innovative achievements and integrates new varieties and technologies at home and abroad.
More than 230 varieties are used in flower beds, including 16 self-bred varieties, 18 new green anti-stress varieties and 11 native plants.
China's self-selected "Hanlu Jinghui", "gorgeous autumn candy" and "colorful autumn" three chrysanthemum varieties have been used for the first time.
In order to welcome the national celebration, Beijing has also recently carried out a comprehensive rectification of the city's landscaping landscape environment, planting more than 12,000 trees, 230,000 flowers and shrubs, and 2.3 million square meters of lawn root flowers.
At the same time, 200 theme flower beds have been set up in important areas such as the city's Ring Road, the Chang'an Street Extension Line, the Xiangshan Memorial Site, the perimeter of the new airport and the perimeter of important tourist attractions. The amount of flowers planted on the ground has reached 20 million pots (plants), 10,000 flower-column pile sketches, 5,000 combination containers and 15,000 hanging flower boxes have been put up, so that the greening environment of the capital has been upgraded in an all-round way.
China releases "China and the United Nations" and reports on climate change, sustainable development and other issues-Xinhua.com
Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, September 26 (Reporter Xu Xiaolei Wang Wen) On September 26, the Chinese delegation to the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly officially released four documents, including "China and the United Nations-China Position Paper of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly", "United Nations Climate Action Summit: China's Position and Action", "China's Progress Report on Implementing the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 (2019)" and "Earth Data Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals".
"China and the United Nations-Chinese Position Paper of the 74th United Nations General Assembly" summarizes the achievements and development of China's cooperation with the United Nations in various fields in the 70 years since the founding of New China, especially since the 18th National Congress of the Party.
It is pointed out that the proposal put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping to promote the construction of a community of human destiny has become the banner of the diplomacy of great powers with Chinese characteristics.
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving national prosperity and people's strength, expanded the way for developing countries to move towards modernization, and provided experience and reference for countries and ethnic groups in the world that both want to accelerate development and want to maintain their own independence to follow a path that conforms to their national conditions.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path suitable for their own national conditions.
Instead of "importing" the foreign model or "exporting" the Chinese model, China will unswervingly follow its own path, realize its own continuous development, strengthen governance and political exchanges with other countries, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance and good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a Foodworks supermarket owner who fired a 66-year-old female worker by text message because he preferred to hire employees from an Asian background was slammed as "shameful."
The committee said Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, who has worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, treated employees in a "grossly unfair" manner and may have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, vice-chairman of the committee, conducted a search on the Internet and found "some job advertisements published by Mr. Wang in various Australian Chinese employment forums in the past".
Among the job requirements listed in these positions, one said "preferred Asian woman" and the other said "preferred Asian employee".
The third post said he was "more inclined to overseas people (sic)".
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, which he later said was due to her absence from work and the alleged lack of a small amount of cash from $5.10 to $30 at the cash register.
However, Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reasons for firing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She has been absent for only one shift in the past three years, and the "missing amount" totals a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms. Ayton's dismissal had "virtually nothing to do with her behavior or performance".
"In my opinion, supported by the evidence of the job advertisement published by Mr. Wang, the real motivation of the respondent to fire her was that he preferred to hire employees with an Asian background," he said.
According to section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's actions ostensibly constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or the dismissal of the applicant is illegal."
Mr. Sams said that, given Mr. Wang's "appalling" treatment of Ms. Ayton, it was inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a casual worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labor relations legislation, Sams said that he would submit his rulings and documents to the head of the committee to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He said that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
"I think the respondent took an incurable unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant. Mr. Wang "waited" for this opportunity, which he thought would 'justify' the termination of the applicant's employment," he said.
"He was wrong... the respondent completely ignored any natural and fair treatment given to her when dismissing the applicant and, shockingly, his rude and extremely unfair perfunctory behavior."
Mr. Sams said that although Foodworks is a small business, "it must be said frankly that no decent employer will fire employees in the extremely unfair and perfunctory manner acknowledged in this case."
"It's shameful, and it's extremely unfair," he said.

Objective: To evaluate the psychological measurement characteristics and performance in the "32 health assessment scales for the elderly" and explore reducing them to a summary table.
BACKGROUND: "32 health assessment scales for the elderly" have been used in local-related well-being research and as a positive measure in long-term care to assess the health status of residents of nursing homes.
However, no redundancy items have been explored before.
Design: cross-sectional study.
Methods: Between November 2013 and September 2014, the staff, as acting scorers of randomly selected residents of Swedish nursing homes (4,831), completed the "32 health assessment scales for the elderly".
During this period, reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis and analysis based on project response theory were carried out.
Statistical and theoretical analysis was used to systematically identify the items to be cut.
Relevant tests, mean comparison and model fitting evaluation confirm the equivalence of the scale.
Results: the psychological measurement characteristics in the "32 health assessment scales for the elderly" were satisfactory, and the items to be cut in the scale were determined.
The proposed summary table shows a high degree of internal consistency (α = 0.90) and strong correlation (r = 0.98) with the original scale, while maintaining the diversity of project factor structure and project difficulty.
Conclusion: the original scale and summary table show the good validity and reliability of measuring the health status of residents in nursing homes.
Impact: there is a lack of positive measures in nursing homes to feel the world of life.
The summary table shows the good validity and reliability of measuring the health status of residents and provides a feasible measure with enhanced function for the research, evaluation and nursing planning of geriatric care to promote health in nursing homes.
6 People deny involvement in selling fake big horse card newspaper raw paper case to high court
Six men suspected of forging and selling China's passports, newspaper papers and identity cards, including an assistant director of the State Name Registration Bureau and a businessman with the rank of superintendent, passed the case on Thursday. The magistrate approved the charges of anti-trafficking in persons and anti-trafficking in migrants and handed them over to the High Court for trial.
Among them, the defense lawyer who originally represented Dato' Chinese defendant Li Zhenhua, also a member of the Sunset Cave District Congress, Rael, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the case, i.e. he would no longer be the representative lawyer of the defendant, which was approved in court.
He said that he had attracted criticism from political opponents for representing the defendant, and that his Action Party had also been implicated.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threat, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to slander the Action Party and the Greek League government or other Greek League leaders, so the decision was made after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between representing the defendant and being a member of the National Assembly, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants. So far, the defendant, Li Zhenhua, has not been convicted.
The six defendants were charged in court on September 12 this year. Faced with a number of charges under Article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act, as well as Article 466 of the Criminal Code (forgery of documents), they all denied their guilt and were not granted bail by the court.
On Thursday, two district court judges, Noshaha and Mazlan, approved the prosecution's application to transfer the charges of anti-trafficking in persons and anti-trafficking in migrants decrees involving the six defendants to the high court for trial after the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense. The charges of forgery of documents will be heard in the district court on October 3, waiting for the prosecution to hand over the documents to the defense.
The earlier six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA), so the judge did not grant bail.

The world's oldest hairdresser died at the age of 108 and had his hair cut for 96 years
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest hairdresser certified by Guinness World Records in New York, United States. At the age of 108, he never retired to cut his hair for his guests every day. However, on the 19th, Mancinelli died of complications from jaw cancer and bid farewell to his 96-year-old hair-cutting life.
According to CNN, Mancinelli emigrated to the United States when he was eight years old. He soon helped clean the floor in a barber shop. At the age of 12, he began to pick up scissors to serve his guests, thereby alleviating the financial pressure on his family.
Although Mancinelli attended primary school at the time, he did not graduate.
Mancinelli's son, Robert, revealed that his father loved his work and people from all over the world liked him. However, although his father had always been healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year. He was finally unable to work due to physical factors six weeks before his death, but this was not a retirement because he planned to come back to cut his hair when he got better.
Robert, 82, said he now had to find a new hairdresser after his father died because he had asked his father to help cut his hair all his life.

We all firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and oppose any country to create obstacles for developing countries and deprive them of the right to achieve development.
Qingyang, Gansu Province: Lake sheep came to "get rid of poverty".
The autumn of September renders the Loess Plateau.
In the Yimin Aquaculture Professional Cooperative in Yima Town, Xia Weili, a 58-year-old villager, filled the trough in the sheepfold with the last spade of fodder, stood by the trough and watched the white lake sheep chew.
"It's delicious. When autumn and winter are full of fat, you can sell it at a good price."
Shavili said that he fed "special nutritious meals" to sheep every day, regularly cleaned, sterilized and disinfected, carefully waited on and did not dare to snub.
Shavili raised sheep for more than 20 years. He did not know how extensive he used to herd sheep until he came to work in a cooperative.
Xia Weili is a native of Xia Yuchi Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbors are sheep farmers, but he adheres to the traditional way of herding. The quality of sheep is poor and the amount of sheep is small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shavili devoted himself to farming all day because he always had a lot of energy in his heart.
The stockholders are all poor households. They all entrust the sheep to the cooperative. Whether they can share the dividend and sell the price at the end of the year, they all count on him.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technicians, he slowly learned to carry out epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few "good handles" of farming in the village.
Yimin Aquaculture Professional Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, head of the cooperative, said that the standardized sheep shed has a good way inside and outside.
"The wool is thick and easy to breed bacteria. The lake sheep cannot stay in a sultry and damp place. The sheep shed must be built in a three-sided gutter, and a fan must be installed to ventilate and dissipate heat."
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, it is necessary to spray and disinfect the sheep shed regularly and give the sheep three to four vaccinations in the first quarter.
In addition to living well, "little fat sheep" have to eat grass mixed with silage corn, wheat grass, alfalfa and so on, and have a wide enough "playground" to stretch their bones.
The cooperative adopts the method of trusteeship and maintenance, guides local farmers to put well-bred lake sheep here, uniformly raises, manages and sells them, and realizes well-bred, scientific, standardized and intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep shares receive more than 6,000 yuan in dividends per household each year, and four poverty alleviation clients who have set up file cards work in cooperatives.
From "grazing all over the mountains" to "accurate feeding", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "looking at the size and touching the belly" to "doing B-Supers one by one"... In Qingyang, Gansu Province, meat and sheep farming is not only a change in the mode of feeding. The model of "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" has changed the scene of "raising sheep on the hillside and selling sheep in the market".
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Ltd., the leading local enterprise, will buy at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, general consultant of Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Ltd., said that by providing poor households with loan guarantees, sheep supply, order farming, quotation acquisition, unified processing and sales services, enterprises have driven more and more poor households to read the "sheep scripture".
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved a steady increase in income through "joining" the forage farming, good seed breeding, large-scale farming, slaughtering division and market sales of Zhongsheng agriculture and animal husbandry.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agricultural and pastoral interlaced zone, rich in forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale meat and sheep farms and cooperatives in the city. The number of meat and sheep raised has reached more than 5 million. Two processing and production lines with a slaughter scale of 1.3 million meat and sheep have also been built. Sheep herds are becoming the "leading sheep" for poverty alleviation in the local industry.
French finance minister says he will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and calls on Germany to follow suit
Paris, Sept. 26 (Reuters)-French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros (US$10.9 billion) next year and that Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive the sluggish economy.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Lemaire said the European Central Bank's latest monetary easing initiative has created an opportunity for member governments that can afford it to increase investment.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart debt purchases to drive down borrowing costs in the hope of stimulating economic recovery and driving up inflation.
"Low interest rates will not bring Europe back to prosperity. Monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough," Lemaire told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, it needs it now, the sooner the better. Don't wait until the situation gets worse," he added.
He has repeatedly made this appeal to Germany.
France has implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, which has given a great boost to France's economic growth.
And the global economy has lost momentum, with the export-dependent German economy bearing the brunt.
Lemaire pointed out that the tax burden on French households will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including 5 billion euros in income tax relief.
In addition, with the gradual implementation of the corporate tax rate, which will be reduced from 33.3% to 25% over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Study: US National Healthy Eating Index increases slightly but still poses challenges-China News Network
NEW YORK, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- A recent study in the United States shows that the U.S. government's healthy eating index has increased moderately in the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But with a full score of 100, this is not worth celebrating.
American nationals still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
Dr. Zhang Fangfang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts and one of the authors of the study, said that Americans still consume too much food that may cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity, which are the most common diseases among American nationals.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the 24th.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the U.S. government from 1999 to 2016.
"Despite considerable improvements, significant dietary challenges remain," the authors wrote.
It is reported that these challenges include getting American nationals to reduce their intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, butter and other foods containing saturated fat.
The study found that people's intake of these unhealthy fats in their daily diet increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended intake ceiling of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the American national diet is the reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officials believe that the intake of added sugar should be less than 10% in the daily diet.
As for the reasons for the decrease in sugar intake, the researchers believe that it is related to the decrease in people drinking sweet soda, but Zhang Fangfang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
There has been a small increase in the intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grain foods by American adults.
However, data from 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Although people's intake of salt has decreased slightly and the decrease in drinking juice has led to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang Fangfang said that they still account for as much as 42% of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on biannual personal health surveys that allow adults to recall the food they ate in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's dietary guidelines for American residents recommend that people adopt a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should eat more nutrient-intensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs and seeds that can provide protein.
During the research period, the number of American nationals suffering from diabetes almost doubled to more than 7%. The obesity rate has also increased in many years during the research period-about 70% of American adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among American nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
Nguyen Van Binh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee and Minister of Economic Affairs of the Central Committee, led a delegation to attend the forum.
According to the close cooperation between the EU and partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the forum is "docking between the EU and Asia: building bridges for a sustainable future".
The forum was held one year after the implementation of the docking strategy between the two continents of the European Union.
Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said that strengthening the docking is part of the above-mentioned idea because it brings benefits to the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
The above-mentioned relationship will help bring stability and prosperity to all parties concerned.
At the same time, he believes that the EU wants to convey the message of increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial docking relationship between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a special guest of honor at the forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary session.
China's first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary set up to use technology to empower management business
On the 26th, Everbright Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary Everbright Financial Management Co. Ltd. was officially established in Qingdao. This is the first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary established in China.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial science and technology. The establishment of financial management subsidiaries by banks is conducive to their use of scientific and technological means to enhance their management business.
In April this year, Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank issued separate announcements that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to set up a financial management subsidiary.
On September 24, Everbright Bank announced that Everbright Financial Management had been officially approved to open.
Just two days later, Everbright Bank led many joint-stock banks and took the lead in establishing Everbright Financial Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, chairman of Everbright Group, said that Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern scientific and technological thinking and means, rely on big data, Internet of Things and cloud computing, improve the coverage, utilization and penetration of financial capital, and improve customers' sense of acquisition, happiness and security.
By 2021, we will establish and improve the "four pillars and eight pillars" for the development of China's financial science and technology, further enhance the ability of the financial industry to apply science and technology, realize the deep integration and coordinated development of finance and science and technology, and significantly increase the satisfaction of the people with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, chairman of Everbright Financial Management, introduced that the management platform of Everbright Financial Management will use intelligent investment, intelligent investment research, big data and other technologies to help Everbright Financial Management better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trend from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximin, a special researcher at the National Finance and Development Laboratory, said that under the new competitive situation facing the management industry, financial technology companies and management institutions will jointly explore a new growth path with management technology.
Financial science and technology to empower the management industry is not only the need of the transformation and development of financial science and technology itself, but will also inject new vitality and vitality into the development of the management business.
At the beginning of this year, Jingdong Digital Technology launched a new management technology system to enhance the product research and development and wind control capabilities of management with the help of technology and digital means.
The new system begins with four major capabilities: product design, sales transaction, asset management and risk assessment, and improves the overall intelligent operation level of the management industry.
Experts believe that while improving customer service ability and innovating rich products, management technology can also enhance risk prevention ability and improve management efficiency.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, it was easy to have deviations in locating customers' risk preferences through questionnaires. Now, using artificial intelligence to portrait users is helpful to better locate customers, launch corresponding products according to customers' investment preferences and help defuse risks.
"Alternative big data such as e-commerce and space-time data can help us better map the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry."
Zhang Xuyang said that while defusing risks, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
China's deepest railway tunnel shaft record set
Baoshan, China News Agency, September 27 (Zhang Weiming Xu Weiguo Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the excavation of shaft No. 1 Of the Gao Ligongshan Tunnel of the Da (Li) Rui (Li) Railway was completed on the 27th. The depth of the well reached 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the record for the deepest shaft of the railway tunnel in China, which was set under the condition of a large influx of water.
The 34.5-kilometer-long Da Rui Railway Gao Ligongshan Tunnel is located in Yunnan. The tunnel crosses the Gao Ligongshan Mountains from the west bank of the Nujiang River, making it the longest single-hole tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel passes through 19 fault zones and has a maximum depth of 1,155 meters. Because it covers almost all the bad geology and major risks that may be encountered in the construction of the tunnel, the Gao Ligongshan Tunnel is known as the "Geological Museum" for the construction of the tunnel.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of the Gao Ligongshan Tunnel. It has the important task of increasing the operating surface to realize the "short hit of the long tunnel" and the ventilation of the later railway operation.
The successful excavation of shaft No. 1 To the bottom of the well marks the official entry of the Gao Ligongshan Tunnel into horizontal tunnel construction. After the excavation of the vehicle yard at the bottom of the well and the replacement of equipment, four operating surfaces can be added underground to accelerate the excavation speed of the main hole of the tunnel.
"The shaft is all in the granite formation. Because there are more cracks in the granite formation, it can't stop the water. It keeps flowing from top to bottom. Basically, the water pressure is as great as the depth of the well."
Shi Jingzhao, chief engineer of the Dari Railway Project Department of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, told the reporter that during the construction of the shaft, there were many dangerous situations such as mud gushing and collapse. The builder invited experts to take the pulse on the spot and discussed the treatment plan more than 20 times.
"When the water in the shaft is the largest, it reaches more than 300 cubic meters per hour. At the bottom of the well, which is more than 700 meters deep, the water pressure is equivalent to the seabed at a depth of 700 meters."
Shi Jingzhao said, "If drainage is not pumped in time, the well will be flooded 10 meters in one hour. We spend almost 85% of our time treating water and 15% of our time digging in."
In order to overcome the geological difficulties such as the longitudinal joint development of the surrounding rock, mud gushing and water-rich granite in the No. 1 Shaft, the tunnel construction adopts a systematic water control measure combining "exploration, injection and excavation" to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of No. 1 Shaft has formed a mechanized assembly line such as excavation system, ballast system, suspension system and winch lifting system. It has realized the mechanized operation of the whole process such as eye-drilling, blasting, ballasting, template installation and concrete pouring, and accelerated the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the shaft successfully completed the excavation at a depth of 762.59 meters.
With a total length of 330 kilometers, the Dari Railway is an important part of the China-Myanmar international corridor and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the "Belt and Road" construction.
When completed and opened to traffic, the travel time between Dali and Ruili will be shortened from the current six hours of the highway to two hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and play a role in promoting economic and trade cooperation and friendly personnel exchanges between China and South Asian and Southeast Asian countries.
Lin Zhengyue: As a Chinese, I am proud of my country's achievements
Hong Kong press celebrates 70th anniversary.
The "Hong Kong Press Celebration of the 70th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" was held in Hong Kong on 27th.
Speaking at the reception, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mrs. Carrie Lam, pointed out that the achievements of the country over the past 70 years have been witnessed by the world, and we are proud as Chinese.
Lin Zhengyue'e, Lu Xinning, Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central Government in Hong Kong, Song Ru'an, Deputy Special Commissioner of the Special Representative Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, Chen Yading, Deputy Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong, and Jiang Jaizhong, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Press Celebration Preparatory Committee, attended the reception and served as the main guests.
In her speech, Lin Zhengyue pointed out that China has made great strides in the past 70 years. Although it has faced many difficult challenges, it has overcome and surpassed them one by one. The achievements have been witnessed by the world, and we are proud as Chinese.
After returning to the motherland, Hong Kong has been closely linked with the Mainland, working together to make progress and share fruitful results.
I believe that under the premise of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong can continue to exert its advantages in the future, seize the opportunities of the "Belt and Road" and the Greater Bay Area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, and seek a better future for Hong Kong.
She also said that over the past few months, Hong Kong society has been in constant dispute, every Hong Kong person has been affected, and journalists have faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, I hope that friends in the press will continue to rise to the challenge, uphold professionalism, make fair and balanced news coverage for the community, and do their part for the future of Hong Kong and for the community to return to rational communication and dialogue.
In his speech, Jiang Jae-chung pointed out that the glorious course of New China is also the course of Hong Kong's development with the motherland, common progress, blood ties, honor and disgrace.
In particular, since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the Central Government has unswervingly implemented the principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy. Hong Kong and the Mainland have worked together in harmony, watched and helped each other, and jointly created a miracle of mutual benefit, win-win and economic take-off.
To this end, the Hong Kong press gathered to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
He said that in the past three months, there has been a series of violent activities in Hong Kong that blatantly violate the law and wantonly undermine social stability. Some media have published distorted and false reports, which have contributed to the violent activities.
He called on the media to raise awareness and create a good atmosphere for the people to resist violence and uphold the rule of law.
Professional media people should adhere to the professional norms of journalism, guide citizens to consciously sever their seats from violence with truthful reporting and responsible speech, and safeguard the justice and majesty of the law.
About 500 people from all walks of life, including the Hong Kong press, attended the reception and raised their glasses with the guest of honor to send blessings to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The reporter learned from the Propaganda Department of the Xining Municipal Committee that Xining City will implement the "Regulations on the Promotion of Civilized Behavior in Xining City" from October 1, focusing on 15 uncivilized acts such as pedestrians not following the instructions of traffic lights and throwing objects out of buildings, listing the key management lists and setting up corresponding penalties.
Wang Shengbin, deputy director of the publicity department of the Xining Municipal Committee and director of the Municipal Civilization Office, introduced that since Xining was awarded the title of a national civilized city in 2017, the civilized literacy and moral level of citizens have improved significantly.
However, uncivilized behaviors such as pedestrians crossing the road, running red lights and non-motorized vehicles not following traffic lights; high-altitude parabola, car window parabola; smoking in public places, walking dogs in public places and allowing defecation everywhere are still very prominent and easy to rebound and need to be solved as soon as possible.
In the light of the actual situation in Xining, the regulations put forward more comprehensive and high standard requirements for the civilized code of conduct of individuals and units from many aspects, such as public places, public order, public facilities, public environmental hygiene, civilized travel, civilized tourism, civilized Internet access, the construction of civilized campuses, the promotion of civilized family construction, the execution of official duties, the commemoration of heroic martyrs and medical services, so that the whole society can understand "what can be done", "what can be advocated" and "what is prohibited".
"Formulating and issuing regulations to eliminate blind spots and misunderstandings in the cognitive field of civilized behavior, and comprehensively standardizing citizens' behavior, housekeeping, meals, travel, education, tourism, Internet access, green life, marriage and mourning, etc., will provide a strong guarantee of the rule of law for the normalization of the creation of mass spiritual civilization in Xining."
Qiu Huaijun, secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the Xining Municipal People's Congress, said.

British tourist car keys fall into lake family trapped in France for five days
Recently, a couple in Wales, England, took their two children to France for a holiday. As a result, they accidentally dropped their car keys into the lake. The family was forced to wait five days to get the new keys made by the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with their children.
It is reported that on September 16, local time, when the British family was visiting a lake in France, their daughter accidentally knocked over a leather bag and the car keys inside fell into the lake.
But it took them hours and they couldn't find the key.
And all their belongings and cash were locked in the car.
Although British tourists bought insurance before leaving, the insurance company refused to help on the grounds that the vehicle was not in danger of being stolen.
They had to hire a trailer to pull the car to a garage for storage and then re-order the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, the British tourist finally got the key to the preparation, and the couple left France with their children.
Their scheduled journey was canceled due to the loss of the car keys.
To investigate the level of serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its significance in identifying disease activity and lung infection.
There were 122 cases of hospitalized SLE patients, including 21 cases of SLE with lung infection, 16 cases with arthritis, 26 cases with nephritis, 10 cases with vasculitis, and 23 cases with healthy control.
The levels of serum MMP-3, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid protein A (SAA) and touch bead protein (HPT) were detected in all subjects.
The results showed that the level of MMP-3 was higher in SLE patients with lung infection [(230.10 ± 44.92) μg/L], arthritis patients [(140.20 ± 20.76) μg/L], nephritis patients [(155.40 ± 23.36) μg/L] than in SLE patients alone [(91.74 ± 10.47) μg/L].
SLE combined with serum MMP-3, CRP [(1.99 ± 1.03) mg/L], SAA [(92.19 ± 23.93) mg/L], the HPT [(1.42 ± 0.18) g/L] level is higher than that of SLE patients without lung infection [MMP-3 is (115.40 ± 8.93) μg/L. The CRP is (0.44 ± 0.13) mg/L. The SAA is (38.79 ± 8.98) mg/L. HPT is (0.88 ± 0.06) g/L].
Serum MMP-3 [(210.30±45.71) μg/L], CRP [(12.11±5.21) mg/L], the level of HPT [(1.57±0.23) g/L] was higher than that of SLE active patients without lung infection [MMP-3 was (124.00±15.22) μg/L. The CRP is (7.76±2.96) mg/L. HPT is (0.89 ± 0.09) g/L], serum CRP [(10.03 ± 2.70) mg/L], SAA [(89.22 ± 36.77) mg/L] levels, serum CRP [(7.76 ± 2.96) mg/L], the level of SAA [(60.22±19.7) mg/L] was higher than that of SLE stable patients without lung infection [CRP was (1.90±0.39) mg/L. The SAA is (17.60±3.89) mg/L].
It is suggested that serum CRP and SAA levels increase when SLE disease activity is combined with lung infection, and serum MMP-3 levels increase when SLE is combined with lung infection. Therefore, serum MMP-3 combined with CRP may assist in identifying SLE disease activity and combined lung infection.

Pilot the notification commitment system in areas such as food production licenses for low-risk varieties, and delegate the handling authority of representative offices of foreign enterprises to the FTA
On the 27th, the Shanghai Municipal Market Supervision Bureau and the Pudong New Area Government signed a working memorandum and launched 20 market supervision reform measures, some of which are the first pilot in the country.
According to introduction, the notification commitment means that when the administrative organ handles the relevant licensing registration matters, it informs the applicant in writing of the conditions and requirements stipulated in the laws and regulations at one time.
After the applicant has signed the undertaking, the administrative organ may handle it directly.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai market supervision department will support the Pudong New Area and the Shanghai Free Trade Pilot Area to pilot inform the commitment system in three areas, such as enterprise name registration, processing of food production licenses for simple processes, low-risk varieties, and approval of some measuring instruments, so as to make enterprise access more convenient.
Shanghai Shao Wansheng Food Co. Ltd. obtained the Food Production License on the spot by informing the promise on the 27th, becoming the first enterprise to enjoy the pilot dividend.
The person-in-charge of the enterprise said that the food license can also be obtained on the spot, and also adopted the method of "accepting vacancies", that is, allowing the enterprise to submit some materials in accordance with the deadline agreed in the notification commitment, "effectively feeling the convenience of the reform."
The Shanghai market supervision department said that the implementation of the notification commitment system for food production licenses is the first pilot in the country.
After the reform, the examination and approval link was reduced from the previous six links of "registration, acceptance, on-site verification, sample inspection, material examination, examination and approval and certification" to three links of "registration, acceptance, examination and approval and certification", and the completion time was shortened from 20 working days before the reform to on-the-spot completion.
Taking into account the characteristics of Pudong's high degree of economic outward orientation, the Shanghai market supervision department has delegated the registration authority of the permanent representative offices of foreign (regional) enterprises to the Shanghai Free Trade Area to facilitate enterprises to handle the matter nearby.
Statistics show that the decentralization involved a total of 1,592 permanent representative offices in the Shanghai Free Trade Area, of which 99 have been handled in accordance with the new regulations.
"11" Long holiday consumption small survey: choose more diversified tourism to occupy the first place.
As the National Day holiday approaches, people's holiday plans are gradually being finalized.
The reporter of Securities Daily recently launched a small survey on the "11th" holiday arrangement in the circle of friends. Nearly 20 feedbacks received showed that although everyone's plans are different, "tourism + consumption" has become the key word of the "11th" holiday.
Specifically, in the feedback received by the reporter of Securities Daily, more than half of the people chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said, "It is planned to take his family to Shanghai for a visit during the '11th' period. Disney is the first stop and then go to the surrounding cities for a turn." Ms. Li's family in Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan. "A family of three set off on September 28 and planned a 10-day tour around the island." Miss Ma of Chongqing has planned an outbound tour to Singapore. Mr. Zhang's family in Hebei chose to travel on their own. He said, "My daughter is less than two years old and it is not convenient to go far away. She plans to drive herself to Shandong and spend a few days by the sea."
The "Report on Travel and Travel Trends of Residents during the 2019 National Day Golden Week" jointly released by Tong Cheng Yilong and Tong Cheng Tourism recently shows that there is a clear trend of consumption upgrading in the three subdivisions of travel, residence and travel during this year's National Day Golden Week.
The penetration rate of aircraft and high-speed rail travel has steadily increased, and the proportion of demand for star-rated hotels and personalized non-standard accommodation has increased.
On September 23, the "2019 National Day Tourism Consumption Trend Report" released by the United States Mission showed that tourism consumption continued to flourish and showed a diversified and upgraded trend of "eating, living and playing".
More young people travel in favor of high-quality and distinctive experiences. The enthusiasm of cultural tourism, night tourism and so on continues to rise.
In addition to tourism, all kinds of consumer demand were also released centrally during the "Eleventh" period.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the Securities Daily, "The main plan for this year's '11th' is to buy a car."
In general, September and October of each year are known as the golden period for automobile sales, a staff member of a Beijing automobile brand 4S store told the Securities Daily.
During the "Eleventh" period, stores will launch a number of activities, such as lottery, store reduction and so on.
In addition, many brands have recently launched new models, and it is expected that the new products will have a more obvious boost to sales.
Under the trend of consumption upgrading, people pay more attention to meeting the needs at the spiritual level, and the proportion of consumption of services such as culture and education is increasing.
Ms. Du, who lives in Beijing, said, "Since the birth of a child, the consumption of culture and education has become the bulk of household consumption expenditure.
This year's 'Eleventh' is full. We are going to the 'Card' Planetarium and the Children's Theatre. We have arranged for several families to set up tents and camp at the Elk Museum on weekends. We have also arranged some audition experience classes."
Some industry insiders said that, in theory, the evolution path of residents' consumption upgrading is from survival-oriented consumption to development-oriented consumption and enjoyment-oriented consumption, of which a considerable part of the content of enjoyment-oriented consumption is the category of service-oriented consumption.
With the continuous development of China's economy and society and the rising income level of residents, people pay more and more attention to the consumption needs at the spiritual level. Tourism and travel are a good way.
In particular, in time for the "11th" National Day holiday, people are more willing to travel and spend, which can not only meet the consumption needs at the spiritual level, but also reflect the upgrading of residents' consumption.
In the afternoon, he began to be lonely and did not want to go out. He had not adjusted the state in which the children were not around.
Cheer up and say to the dog Nana: Mom takes you out of the house.
I carefully wrote several things to do when I went out. The personality characteristics of type A blood became stronger and stronger, and I felt very awkward.
Take a suit, buy nutritious granules, pay, buy raw fish slices, Nana's snacks.
These are the reasons for going out.
On the phone, I just said to my sister Aiji that thanks to Nana, otherwise there would be no excuse to buy snacks.
There was a few perfunctory smiles, saying that the child had called and hung up.
Nana jumped onto the assistant seat and got down honestly. She knew she was carsick, frightened and unwilling not to accompany me.
Her husband, Boo, rarely came back early.
After repeatedly admiring the delicious salad of salmon mixed with shea butter, he went to his bedroom to lie in bed and watch TV.
Take a look at the plutonium on the wall. It was just 7 o'clock. The sunset in the country of sunrise was also early. It was already dark.
The circle of friends is inventing the moon. It turns out that today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Washed a bunch of grapes sent by friends and left half to Boo. The rest was put in a favorite small flower bowl and brought out to see the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I ate the grapes and she ate the skin, and I vomited the seeds of the grapes far away.
The moon is hiding in the clouds. Fortunately, when the clouds are walking, the moon suddenly appears, and it is a bit dazzling when it is bright and dark.
All kinds of poems about the bright moon are surging in my mind, but I only clearly like this sentence: reunion every three or five years/full of light and jade bars/a round in the sky/all the names in the world look up.
Maybe we have given the moon too much emotion. For me now, in fact, that sentence of God to God and Caesar to Caesar is the best.
The color of the moon is the color of the moon, and the mood is yours.
After eating the grapes, this cold moon is cool.
With a slight snoring at her feet, Nana stood up and spread Nana's little blanket on the edge of her little house, on which Nana lay happily.
Open the door and shout: Is the bath water ready?
You can't see the moon from the bathroom window. You can only feel the moonlight. Turn off the bathroom lights and clatter open the glass.
No mooncakes, no alcohol.

Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for German undergraduates on the basis of college entrance examination results
Recently, Germany's Anabin database, which is responsible for evaluating and certifying foreign academic qualifications, announced on the official website: From 2020, Chinese high school graduates can directly apply for a German university degree on the basis of their college entrance examination results, without first having to register at a domestic university.
Prior to this, Chinese high school graduates who want to apply to German universities need to study for one semester (211,985 universities) or three semesters (general undergraduates) at the domestic undergraduate level and pass the APS examination or TestAS examination.
The release of the new rules may save at least half a year for Chinese students who wish to study in Germany.
It is reported that the new regulations will come into effect in the second half of 2019.
Applicants should meet the requirements of: completing 12 years of formal compulsory education and obtaining a high school diploma; participating in the college entrance examination and the college entrance examination, and the college entrance examination score reaches 70% or more of the total score (if the total score is 750, it needs to reach more than 525 points), and it includes the requirements of two language scores and one mathematics or natural science score.
In addition, the requirements of specific majors for the results of the college entrance examination are different.
For example, to apply for majors such as medicine, oral medicine, veterinary medicine and pharmacy, the college entrance examination score must reach 80% of the full score, and the college entrance examination subject must include at least two subjects in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology, or participate in the science complex; to apply for a law major, the college entrance examination score must reach 80% of the full score, and the college entrance examination subject must include at least two subjects in foreign languages, history and geography, or participate in the literature complex.
According to incomplete statistics, at present, many countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, have recognized the results of China's college entrance examination.
Taking the United Kingdom as an example, universities such as the University of Cambridge, the University of Birmingham and the University of Leicester all accept Chinese students to apply for admission on the basis of college entrance examination results.
Military "machine dog" first takes performance class solar troupe: consider including the performance lineup.
The U.S. military funded the development of a "machine dog" for the battlefield, and may now be the first to appear on the circus stage!
Cirque du Soleil has said it is in contact with Boston Dynamics, which develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of applying robots to circus performances.
According to comprehensive foreign media reports, Boston Power Technology Company released a promotional video of "four-legged robot Spot" on the 24th. The content shows that Spot is an agile mobile robot that can carry a load of 14 kg and has the mobility, 360-degree obstacle avoidance function, navigation, remote control and autonomy that are highly adapted to cross-country terrain.
In particular, Spot has a proprietary software platform specifically developed only for Spot, and users can set up their own Spot robot functions through various applications.
Boston Power Technology first published the idea of a machine dog in 1992, which caused a sensation at the time, but has not yet really been put into commercial use.
However, Boston Power Technology pointed out that at present, Spot has entered the mass production stage, and most of the subscribers are mainly construction and energy operators.
In addition, Cirque du Soleil is currently in contact with Boston Dynamics Technology. Cirque du Soleil said the project is still in the conceptual stage and is assessing the potential of Spot for use in the performance scene.
The Information Office of the State Council released the White Paper "China and the World in the New Era"
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Information Office of the State Council released the White Paper "China and the World in the New Era" on the 27th.
Xu Lin, vice-minister of the Central Propaganda Department and director of the Information Office of the State Council, said that the white paper focuses on issues such as "where China comes from and where it goes", "what kind of world China promotes to build" and "how a developing China can get along with the world", systematically introduces China's development achievements, development path and development direction, and expounds in depth China's relations with the world in order to enhance the international community's understanding and understanding of China's development.
The white paper points out that over the past 70 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, earth-shaking changes have taken place in China, creating an unprecedented development miracle in the history of mankind. In particular, since the 18th National Congress of the Party, China has made historic achievements and made historic changes in its development.
Through a large number of data and facts, the white paper introduces the great achievements, great significance and world contribution of China's development over the past 70 years.
The white paper points out that China has taken decades to complete the development process that developed countries have gone through for hundreds of years. The total economic volume has jumped to the second largest in the world. Nearly 1.4 billion people have emerged from material shortages, generally reached a well-off level and enjoyed unprecedented dignity and rights.
The white paper emphasizes that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have made a new world by starting from scratch, becoming self-reliant and working hard. Over the past 70 years, China has developed in its contacts and interaction with the world, embracing the world, learning from the world and contributing to the world. Over the past 70 years, while realizing its self-development, China has made contributions to world peace and injected impetus into the common development of all countries.
The white paper points out that the fundamental reason for the success of China's development over the past 70 years is that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and have unswervingly followed this path.
The white paper emphasizes that the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a road established from the national conditions of the country, a road that puts the interests of the people first, a road of reform and innovation, a road that seeks common development in opening up, and a road that governs the country in an all-round way according to law.
China's development path, in line with China's national conditions and in line with the requirements of the times, will increasingly show bright development prospects as the times progress.
In response to the concerns of the international community about China's development, the white paper emphasizes that realizing the prosperity and strength of the country, the revitalization of the nation and the well-being of the people is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of the people of all countries.
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and driving force of world economic growth. Opening up to the outside world in all directions creates more opportunities for the development of all countries. China provides more public goods to the international community. China's development provides experience and reference for other developing countries. China will never follow the path of "national strength and hegemony".
In the face of the question of the era of "what happened to the world and what mankind did", the white paper points out that today's world is in a great change that has not been seen in a century. Human society is full of both hope and challenges.
China has proposed building a community of human destiny, opening up a new development path of win-win cooperation and sharing, and providing new options for human development.
The white paper calls on all countries to unite to build a new type of international relations, promote a new type of economic globalization, safeguard the international system with the United Nations at its core, promote the exchange of civilizations and mutual learning, jointly promote the construction of a community of human destiny and build a better world.
With the increasing development of China, the international community is generally concerned about how the developing China can get along with the world.
The white paper points out that China's development cannot be separated from the world, and the world's peaceful development, prosperity and stability cannot be separated from China.
China has always placed its own development in the coordinate system of human development, adhered to win-win cooperation and common development, adhered to maintaining and promoting economic globalization, actively developed the global partnership, firmly supported multilateralism, safeguarded international fairness and justice, promoted the high-quality development of building a "one belt, one road" together, actively participated in leading the reform and construction of the global governance system, and has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of the international order.
At present, China's development has entered a new era.
The white paper points out that in the new era, China's determination to follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics will not change, its determination to learn from each other and win-win cooperation with other countries will not change, and its determination to work hand in hand with the world will not change.
Finally, the white paper points out that in today's world, the future and destiny of all countries have never been as closely linked as they are now.
The white paper "China and the World in the New Era" consists of the foreword, body and conclusion, with a full text of more than 29,000 words.

Zygomatic maxillary complex (ZMC) fractures are one of the most common types of fractures in the jaw. In addition to clinical symptoms such as facial depression and double vision, they often cause abnormal sensations in the lateral lower eyelid, zygomatic face, nose, upper lip skin and mucous membrane due to damage to adjacent suborbital nerves.
This paper reviews the anatomical basis of suborbital nerve injury, the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment and prognosis of suborbital nerve injury in ZMC fracture.
Did MCA play in the by-election for the parliamentary seat of Tanjung Biai in Johor?
MCA President Dato' Seri Wei Jiaxiang: "Discussion by the Supreme Council of the National Front!"
The by-election of Tanjung Biai is imminent. Whether Ma Hua of the BN member party will play in this traditional national seat is a matter of concern.
However, after the meeting of the Central Committee of MCA, it was announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional MCA seat would continue to be handed over to MCA or replaced by other member parties.
Wei Jiaxiang told the media after presiding over the meeting of the Central Committee of Ma Hua on Thursday afternoon that any by-election will be conducted by the National Front in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), that is, it will have to pass the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front before it can be finalized.
He said that as the Election Committee will not meet until next Monday (1) to finalize the by-election of Tanjung Biai, the meeting of the BN Supreme Council is expected to be held in early October.
"Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with BN President Dato' Seri Ahmad Zahi. We all agreed that we must regain this seat from the League of Hope."
"We have finalized a special BN leadership meeting in early October, and the leaders of the three BN parties will determine which member party will play."
Asked whether MCA would insist on taking the traditional seat to the BN Supreme Council, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that, as president of MCA, he must act in accordance with the standard operating procedures, so any decision must reach the consensus of the BN.
"In any by-election, some people are willing to go out, some political parties and some parties think they should come out, which is a common thing."
"The most important thing is what organization and political alliance are we from?"
"This is a great test for us to form a political alliance over the years. We believe that the BN has come all the way with some valuable values."
"It's not surprising that someone might say something in the process."
"However, once the BN Supreme Council has made a decision, everyone must make every effort to prepare for the war. That is the most valuable."
In any case, Wei Jiaxiang said that MCA will make every effort to prepare for the upcoming Tanjung Biai by-election at three levels, namely, the District Council, the State Joint Committee and the Central Committee.
"The District Council will be led by Dato' Seri Huang Zhisheng, Chairman of the District Council (Danjung Biai); the State Council will be led by Dato' Lin Peixing, Acting Chairman of the Juzhou Joint Committee; and the Central Committee will be personally deployed by Dato' Ma Hanshun, Acting President of the General Council, and Dato' Zhang Shengwen, General Secretary."
On Saturday (21), Dato' Mohamed Farley, Member of Parliament of the Aboriginal Solidarity Party Tanjung Biai, died of heart problems at the stupid government hospital at the age of 42.
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was ordered to "volunteer to patrol the mountains" for hunting wild animals
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced for hunting wild animals and ordered to compensate 15,420 yuan (RMB, same as below) for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources.
Due to the poverty of the defendant's family, the procuratorial organ used alternative labor to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration, thus realizing the organic unity of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongliang, Deputy Procurator-General of Baokang County Procuratorate, introduced on the 27th that through three months of "compulsory mountain patrol" and other alternative labor, the defendant Zhou Mou has established deep feelings with wild macaques and deeply blamed himself for previous animal hunting.
On June 21 this year, a criminal incidental civil public interest lawsuit filed by the Baokang County Procuratorate in the field of ecological resources was publicly tried in the county court and handed down in court.
The defendant, Zhou Mou, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, four years' probation and a fine of 3,000 yuan. At the same time, he was ordered to compensate 15,420 yuan for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources.
After investigation, Zhou began to set up a power grid on the cliff in late January 2014 and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including spotted antelope, small muntjac and hairy-crowned deer.
The spotted antelope is a national second-class endangered wild animal. The small muntjac and hairy-crowned deer are listed in the National Land Wildlife Conservation List.
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his illegal facts and actions and was willing to bear incidental civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic situation of Zhou's family, under the coordination of the Baokang County Procuratorate, the local village committee, the forest station and Zhou reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation for the cost of ecological restoration: that is, Zhou provided public welfare labor to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration by carrying out the domestication and management of macaques, compulsory mountain patrol and forest protection in the village macaque protection area for one year.
With regard to the prosecutor's proposal, the court accepted and agreed that Zhou, while carrying out the suspended sentence, would actively fulfill the obligation of "alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration costs".
At present, Zhou has been volunteering for three months in the macaque reserve, patrolling the mountains actively and performing well.
In recent years, the Procuratorate of Baokang County has organically integrated the procuratorial function and social governance behavior in practice, scientifically using supervision methods such as procuratorial advice, investigation supervision and litigation supervision, and using judicial means to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment.
The United Nations presents the "Champions of the Earth Award" for "Ant Forest"
In warm applause and magnificent music, Xu Di, head of the "Ant Forest" project, and Shen Junliang, a user representative, stepped onto the podium and took over the trophy of the 2019 United Nations "Champions of the Earth Award" from the host.
The 2019 "Champions of the Earth Award" award ceremony was held in New York, United States, on the 26th. The "Ant Forest" project, which uses mobile phone small programs to drive hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental protection actions, won the "Incentive and Action Award" award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced the list of winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but people attending the award ceremony on the same day were still unable to hide their excitement.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Inge Annosheng, said that "Ant Forest" is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges facing mankind and what humans can do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment so that every individual can participate in actions to protect the planet, which will have a great impact.
"Ant Forest" was launched by China Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Gold Service) on Alipay platform in August 2016. Users accumulate "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as recording green travel in their daily lives in "Ant Forest" and paying water and electricity bills online, and "plant trees" in their mobile phones.
Every time users form a virtual tree, "Ant Forest" and public welfare partners will plant a real tree in a desertified area.
By August this year, 500 million "Ant Forest" users had reduced their carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
In the "Champions of the Earth Award" presented on the same day, Costa Rica won the award for its national environmental protection efforts. Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, who came to receive the award, praised the contribution of "Ant Forest" at the scene, "which can inspire so many people to participate in green action, which is impressive".
Jing Xiandong, chairman and chief executive officer of Ant Gold Service, said that the "Champions of the Earth Award" is a recognition of the "Ant Forest" project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life, an honor that belongs to all participants.
Jing Xiandong said that "Ant Forest" has affected 500 million people in the past three years. The goal of "Ant Forest" in the next three years is to drive 1 billion people around the world to participate in low-carbon actions.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income come more from green mountains and green waters.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through planting trees, it also hopes to help farmers increase their income through agricultural product development projects, e-commerce platforms and so on.
The public welfare and environmental protection model based on digital technology created by "Ant Forest" has also successfully gone to sea and has been used as a reference by other countries.
In June this year, GCash, the largest "electronic wallet" in the Philippines, launched the Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through a low-carbon life.
According to introduction, GCash will work with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, environmental public welfare organizations and others to plan to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the start of the project.
The "Champions of the Earth Award" is the highest award in the field of environmental protection in the United Nations and is awarded once a year.
"Ant Forest" won the award. It is the third consecutive year that the green innovation project from China has won the "Incentive and Action Award" award after the builder of the Saihanba Forest Farm in China and the "Qiancun Demonstration and Wancun Rehabilitation" project in Zhejiang Province, China.
Economic and trade frictions affect the "report card" of the US economy.
The "report card" of the US economy in the second quarter of this year shows that the growth rate of US gross domestic product (GDP) has slowed significantly compared with the previous quarter due to the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts point out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring are the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the US Department of Commerce on the 26th showed that US GDP grew at an annual rate of 2% in the second quarter, the same as the revised data previously released, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
The data show that consumption growth became the main factor supporting the growth of the US economy in the second quarter.
Personal consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70% of the total US economy, increased by 4.6% year-on-year in the quarter, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment fell by 6.3% in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter, dragging down economic growth by 1.16 percentage points in the current quarter; exports fell by 5.7% compared with the previous quarter, and net exports dragged down economic growth by 0.68 percentage points in the current quarter.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of Einside Macroeconomic Consulting, said that instead of maintaining the growth momentum of last year, private sector investment has fallen sharply because economic and trade frictions and rising uncertainty have hit business confidence.
Knapp believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, US corporate capital expenditure is expected to remain in a downward trend next year.
Analysts believe that although consumption growth has formed a strong support for the US economy in the second quarter, there are more and more signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the US consumption outlook.
Richard Curtin, head of the survey and a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said recently that in a recent survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the US economy, a new high in a year and a half.
With regard to the future trend of the US economy, analysts generally believe that the US economy will continue to slow down.
However, some experts said that if economic and trade frictions are eased, the performance of the US industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Kathleen Birch, a global economist at the British Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that in the future, the US economy will continue the gradual downward trend since this year and the growth rate will fall to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts that, assuming that economic and trade frictions do not continue to escalate, the growth rate of the US economy will be 2.3% this year and will slow further to 1.6% next year.
Ellen Hatzen, investment manager of Patnam Investments, pointed out that the biggest concern of enterprises at present is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring. If the economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than it is now.
Matt Melly, stock strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that economic and trade frictions remain the "primary problem" and the main reason for the large fluctuations in the US capital market this year. Whether economic and trade frictions can be properly resolved will be the key to affecting the direction of the US capital market for the rest of this year.
Ningxia is the first couple to take joint parental leave. Parents of children between the ages of 0 and 3 can take 10 days a year
Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important symbol of the progress of social civilization.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were passed by a high vote.
This is the first local regulation formulated and promulgated at the provincial level in Ningxia to comprehensively and systematically protect the legitimate rights and interests of women. It will be formally implemented from November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted this time were revised on the basis of the "Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women" in Ningxia in 2007. They are divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labor and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marriage and family rights and interests, legal responsibilities and by-laws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration and implementation of joint parental leave for husband and wife, which is the first of its kind in the country.
In April this year, the "Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Infants and Children Under the Age of 3" promulgated by the General Office of the State Council has a relevant description for couples to jointly raise children.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia innovatively proposed to "encourage employers to grant 10 days of joint parental leave to both spouses each year between the ages of 0 and 3 for couples who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations".
At the same time, the Regulations highlight the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the compilation of personality rights in China's current Civil Code, and details the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subject and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment, etc.
Article 44 of the Regulations explicitly prohibits the frequent and vicious incidents of sexual assault against girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, becoming a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to women's right to know and deal with the common property of marriage and family, Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women's right to know about the common property and the obligations of property registration agencies and related subjects, so as to provide solid institutional support for women to defend their rights.
In addition, in response to the social hotspot issue of gender discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination, and draws on the latest practical experience of joint interviews to strengthen the punishment of illegal acts of gender discrimination and more vigorously safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women's Federation, together with the Public Prosecution and Law Department and civil affairs departments, have been promoting and introducing social professional forces to participate in the mediation of marriage and family conflicts and the fight against domestic violence, with remarkable results.
The Regulations summarize and promote this. A number of laws and regulations encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional protection and support through the purchase of services.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team released the "Rapid Recommendation Guide for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the 2019 New Coronary Virus (2019-nCoV) Infection", through which we provided experience and reference for the global response to the epidemic.
However, 2019 Coronary Virus Disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease. Based on the ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our understanding of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we respond to an opinion on the above-mentioned guidelines and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest "COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme (7th Edition)" issued by the National Health and Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) broke out. At present, the disease has been officially named 2019 Coronary Virus Disease (COVID-19). The virus was once named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 Coronary Virus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid advice guide, which was published online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted wide attention.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new type of disease. Based on the ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our understanding of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health and Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http:// www.Nhc. Gov.Cn /) published a total of seven editions of the "COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme" between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which have undergone substantial changes.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others, who have proposed a simple scoring scheme based on their own clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guide and a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We recognize and thank them for this important work.
However, their proposal also needs to be updated in the light of the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme (Trial Seventh Edition) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases requires a combination of one epidemiological history feature and two clinical manifestations for comprehensive analysis. If there is no clear epidemiological history, three clinical manifestations need to be met:
Epidemiological history: (1) had a travel or residence history in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities that reported cases of COVID-19 within 14 days before the onset of symptoms. (2) Have a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (positive nucleic acid test). (3) Had a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities that reported COVID-19 within 14 days before the onset of symptoms. (4) Have a history of contact with confirmed cases of aggregation (≥2 patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a small range within 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or reduced total number of white blood cells and reduced lymphocyte count in the early stages of the disease.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases and have any of the following etiological or serological evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 is positive. (2) The whole genome sequencing of the virus shows that it is highly homologous with the known new coronavirus. (3) The specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were positive in the serum test. Or the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 changed from negative to positive, or the drop rate increased by ≥4 times during the recovery period, higher than in the acute phase.
As we can see, the second edition (January 18, 2020) and the third edition (January 22, 2020) added real-time PCR nucleic acid detection in respiratory or blood samples.
The fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (February 8, 2020) added blood specimen etiological detection; the seventh edition later added serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers studying the best nucleic acid test kit to achieve rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens, including blood collection, which increases the availability of different specimens and provides evidence for including the positive results of specific antibodies in the diagnosis criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of atypical symptoms and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou and others should be updated, as they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
In addition, the scoring system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and call on readers to give their opinions.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend referring to and following the latest guidelines of the country where the case is located.
Our team will also update our guidelines in time to help.
Inner Mongolia Xing'an League Academician Yuan Longping workstation salt-and alkali-tolerant rice per acre yield rice broke thousands of kilograms
The reporter learned from the administrative office of the Xing'an League in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the 27th that good news came from the "On-site Measurement and Acceptance Council of Salt-and-alkali-tolerant Rice at the Work Station of Academician Yuan Longping of the Xing'an League" held recently. The average yield of salt-and-alkali-tolerant rice exceeded 1,000 kilograms per acre.
A production measurement expert group composed of six experts from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, Yangzhou University and the Agricultural and Rural Department of Hunan Province sampled and harvested the "Xing salt series" rice on the spot.
After expert evaluation, on land with a pH of 8.8 to 9.6 and a salinity content of 5‰ to 6‰, the average yield of salt-and alkali-tolerant rice reached 508.8 kg per acre.
Wang Shigang, executive director of the workstation of Academician Yuan Longping of the Xing'an League, said, "Our next step is to innovate and reform on the basis of this year's experiment, so as to re-cultivate and optimize salt-and alkali-tolerant rice varieties so that the quality is better and the yield is higher."
Lai Yongcai, vice-president and researcher of the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, head of the expert group on production measurement, said, "On the premise that the factors of production remain unchanged, I think that by continuously strengthening the scientific and technological breakthrough, salt-and alkali-tolerant rice will continue to produce miracles on saline and alkaline land."
Xing'an League belongs to the special hardship area concentrated in the southern foothills of Daxing'anling.
In October 2018, Academician Yuan Longping's workstation was unveiled at the Xing'an League.
Academician Yuan Longping led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction and popularization of the newly cultivated "salt-and-alkali-tolerant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technology, build a 960-acre salt-and-alkali-tolerant rice base in the center of the right wing of Korqin, adopt the technical route of experiment and demonstration while popularizing, and help the local poor to increase production, increase income and lift themselves out of poverty.
This on-site measurement of salt-and-alkali-tolerant rice production not only injects hope for the upgrading of Xing'an League salt-and-alkali medium-and low-yield fields to medium-and high-yield fields, but also provides a scientific basis for rice cultivation in saline-and alkali-tolerant areas under the same conditions in China.
Dry syndrome (SS) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocyte proliferation and progressive exocrine gland injury.
In China, the standardized diagnosis and treatment of SS lags behind other common rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
On the basis of drawing on the experience and guidelines of diagnosis and treatment at home and abroad, the Dry Syndrome Collaboration Group of the Chinese Physicians Association, together with experts in stomatology and ophthalmology, has formulated the "Standards for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Dry Syndrome", which aims to standardize the detection and interpretation of key indicators in SS diagnosis, such as serum anti-SSA antibodies and lip gland pathology, recommend the use of recognized disease activity indicators to evaluate the disease, and standardize the reasonable diagnosis and treatment of patients with local and systemic involvement.
After a marathon debate and weeks of protests, Australia's new state passed an abortion legalization bill on September 26, local time, the Australian Network reported.
It is reported that the bill has sparked political debate in the past eight weeks, and there have been serious differences within the Australian Liberal Party since independent MP Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill.
According to the report, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the ANZ Senate passed the abortion legalization bill by a vote of 26 to 14 on the evening of the 25th, making it the third longest-running bill in the New State Senate.
On the morning of the 26th, after a final vote in the New State House of Representatives, abortion in the New State was legalized.
The bill allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy at 22 weeks of pregnancy and, if two doctors agree, also allows a woman to have an abortion later in pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment on the evening of the 25th. Doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary team of the Hospital Advisory Committee before performing abortions for women after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments passed by the Senate include that doctors must provide appropriate care for infants who survive the termination of pregnancy.
Previously, New State Governor Berejiklian had faced public criticism from conservatives over the bill. Berejiklian had intervened several times to gain more time for debate on the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.
"I need to take the time to run the whole new state," Berejiklian defended her absence from the vote.
It is reported that Australian Liberal MP Davis was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the new state government because of the bill, and said the bill triggered a "government crisis".
But after that, Davis made concessions.
"The content of the amendment to the abortion legalization bill submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of the 26th actually provides more safeguards for women and doctors," Davis said.
Meanwhile, Barilaro, the leader of Australia's New State National Party, said he was proud to be part of a government that legalized abortion.
"What we achieved last night is historic for the new state. It legalizes abortion. Abortion is no longer a crime and women who have abortions will not be treated as criminals."

Finance Minister Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan of state capital to enrich the social security fund.
Finance Minister Liu Kun said on the 27th that so far, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about 860.1 billion yuan.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the national task deployment meeting of transferring some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund jointly convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the SASAC on the same day.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic endowment insurance system. It is a full embodiment of the universal sharing of the development results of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system. It is a policy measure based on the present and taking into account the long term."
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Implementation Plan for Transferring Some State-owned Capital to Enhance the Social Security Fund", which requires the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the pre-transfer work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, the transfer of a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions has been completed in three batches, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about 860.1 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions that the Ministry of Finance performs the duties of donors has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-transfer work of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, transferring state-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out the preparatory work for the transfer, laying the foundation for the next step in the implementation of the transfer.
According to a notice jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the SASAC, the General Administration of Taxation and the Securities Regulatory Commission, the transfer of some state-owned capital from the central and local governments to enrich the social security fund will be fully launched in 2019 and will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made specific arrangements for the full roll-out of the transfer work.
The meeting stressed the need to complete the transfer work in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
"According to the schedule, the transfer work will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The transfer work time is tight and the task is heavy."
Liu Kun said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and carefully arrange to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required; solidly promote the work and accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; and strengthen communication and coordination to solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
The transfer of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund-starting from the starting point of "enriching the money bag of the social security fund", the aim is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical displacement" of equity, but the opening of "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of People's Social Affairs, the SASAC, the General Administration of Taxation and the Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the "Notice on the Full Launch of the Transfer of Some State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund", clarifying the timetable for the transfer of State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, that is, the transfer of some State-owned capital to enrich the Social Security Fund by the central and local governments will be fully launched in 2019.
After the document was published, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented it quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10% of the shares held in ICBC and Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, with the total value of the two shares transferred exceeding 115 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, the Social Security Foundation and other undertakers, as financial investors, enjoy the right to income, disposal and information of the state-owned equity transferred.
ICBC and Agricultural Bank said in the announcement that this change in equity will not lead to changes in the bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, the author believes that the similar equity transfer of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change in equity ownership, but an "addition operation" that can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step in the transfer of some state-owned capital to social security, the "addition result", can naturally reflect that state-owned enterprises are owned by the whole people and the development results are shared by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and their overall profitability is strong and stable.
Among them, leading enterprises continue to achieve excellence and strength.
On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to fully launch the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that, together with relevant departments and in accordance with the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council, it will do a good job in fully launching the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system and the sharing of the development results of state-owned enterprises by all.
The second step of the transfer, the "addition result", is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security fund and further strengthen the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure. This time, as the transferred main body, most of the state-owned funds have the ability to make continuous profits and dividends, which can not only effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide a source of living water for the social security fund.
Some estimates show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the deposit ratio of basic endowment insurance for enterprises can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, the "addition result", is to add a stabilizer to the capital market.
This transfer of the main body to obtain income is "dividend-based, operation-based".
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, the social security fund does mainly obtain equity dividend income.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, the social security fund has strong capital operation ability.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, be conducive to improving the business level of enterprises, and have a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, as an investment vane, the increase of the shareholding weight of the social security fund is conducive to further enhancing its influence in the market and playing the role of a "stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to giving full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guiding investors to invest rationally and value.
This paper studies the accuracy of the measurement of cardiopulmonary physiological parameters under different exercise intensity of the accompanying (wearable) physiological parameter monitoring system.
Using the accompanying physiological parameter monitoring system SensEcho and the cardiopulmonary function testing system METALYZER 3B (CORTEX), the cardiopulmonary physiological parameters of 28 healthy volunteers (17 men and 11 women) under various sports conditions such as standing, lying down and Bruce running platform exercise were collected simultaneously. Using Bland-Altman analysis and correlation analysis, the heart rate and respiratory rate parameters measured by the two types of equipment were compared and analyzed from the perspective of groups and individuals.
The results of population analysis showed that the heart rate and respiration data box maps collected by the two devices were highly consistent. The heart rate difference was (−0.407 ± 3.380) times per minute and the respiration rate difference was (−0.560 ± 7.047) times per minute. The difference was small. The heart rate and respiration rate Bland-Altman diagram showed that the ratio between mean ±2SD was 96.86% and 95.29%, respectively.
This study shows that under various sports conditions, the accompanying physiological parameter monitoring system SensEcho can accurately measure key cardiopulmonary physiological parameters such as human heart rate and respiration rate. It can maintain good stability under various intensity sports conditions and can meet the continuous physiological signal collection and analysis application under sports conditions.
Karl Hartmann was admitted to the Leipzig Conservatory of Music at the age of 18 and studied under Webern.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted in the form of not publishing works in Germany, and later even stopped writing.
In 1933, he wrote the symphony Miserae and dedicated the work to "my sleeping friends".
In 1935, the symphony was first performed in Prague, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
After that, Hartmann was determined not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's funeral concerto was a violin and string concerto, the manuscript of which was stolen from Germany and premiered in Switzerland.
Listen to the funeral concerto played by the Berne Chamber Orchestra at the Beethoven Festival in 2018.

The first batch of 45 "Red Flag EV" Robotaxi vehicles jointly developed by Apollo and FAW Red Flag began trial operation in the part of Changsha that has been opened for testing.
From now on, ordinary Changsha citizens can log on to the Apollo official website to apply to become seed users and have the opportunity to try out the experience.
An experiential passenger said that he sat in the back row of the vehicle, clicked on the screen in front of the passenger seat and opened the vehicle's self-driving itinerary with one click.
In the car, for the safety of passengers and the requirements of current policies and regulations, the trial operation vehicle is equipped with a safety officer in the driving seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
In the course of driving, vehicles can intelligently change lanes according to road conditions. They can also judge the driving conditions of surrounding vehicles and automatically avoid situations such as overtaking at close range.
Throughout the experience, the passenger area screen shows the road conditions of pedestrians, cars and even some traditional blind areas on the road in real time.
Even if the vehicle is blocked, you can see the change of traffic lights and waiting time in front of you in advance. All the road conditions are clear at a glance.
Driverless had heard on TV before and thought it was far away from us, but today it feels amazing to find it in our lives.
We expect it to truly enter the lives of ordinary people in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo received 45 manned test licenses from the Changsha Municipal Government.
At present, the open road of automatic driving test in Changsha passes through Changsha Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology City, Meixi Lake, Yanghu Lake, Dawang Mountain and Gaoxin District. The total length has reached 135 kilometers, and the demonstration area has reached 70 square kilometers. At present, it is the longest road mileage and the largest area in China, covering the most complex scenes and the most advanced intelligent driving demonstration area with the most advanced road coordination infrastructure.
It is expected that by the end of 2019, the pilot road of the Apollo Robotaxi team in Changsha will cover about 50 kilometers, and it is planned to cover 135 kilometers of roads currently open in Changsha in the first half of 2020.
Women's volleyball winner Lang Ping is still dissatisfied: it will be difficult to play a strong team with so many mistakes
On the afternoon of the 27th Beijing time, the Chinese women's volleyball team ushered in the ninth match of the 2019 Women's Volleyball World Cup, against the strong Dutch women's volleyball team. In the end, the Chinese women's volleyball team defeated the Dutch women's volleyball team 3-1, ushering in the ninth consecutive victory of the Women's Volleyball World Cup.
However, after the match, the head coach of the women's volleyball team, Lang Ping, expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's performance in the third inning.
"In the third inning, the other side strengthened the aggressiveness of the service. Some of us (one pass) were not in place and could not attack the ball. We made a lot of mistakes."
"It's hard to play against a strong team and make so many mistakes."
Lang Ping said in an interview after the match.
"We told the players to be focused, the first pass was not in place, we had to adjust and attack well, and we had to play defense with each other."
Lang Ping also commented on Zhang Changning's performance, saying that she encountered some difficulties in the attack, was more anxious, wanted to kill the ball too much, and the action would be deformed.
I hope she will be patient. "We all give her protection."
China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
(70 Years of New China) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper said that with the rapid increase of China's comprehensive national strength and international influence, some people in the world fear that China will follow the path of "national strength and hegemony". Some people have put forward the so-called "China threat theory".
This has not only cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudices, but also the psychological imbalance brought about by the growth of power, as well as deliberate distortions to safeguard their own vested interests.
It is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of the people of all countries to realize the prosperity and strength of the country, the revitalization of the nation and the happiness of the people.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge."
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth. China is the largest contributor to world economic growth. China's scientific and technological innovation has injected new momentum into world economic growth, and the role of the stabilizer and power source of China's economy will become more prominent in the future.
At present, the growth momentum of the world economy is insufficient. A sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development. New types of industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization have been accelerated, the economic structure has been deeply adjusted, industrial optimization has been continuously upgraded, and new economic growth points have been emerging.
"According to the research report of the McKinsey Global Institute, by 2040, the integration of China and other economies in the world is expected to create an economic value of US$22 trillion to US$37 trillion, equivalent to 15-26% of the total global economy. The strengthening of cooperation between other economies in the world and China will create great economic value."
The white paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economic operation, higher growth quality and promising growth prospects, is a long-term good for the development of the world economy.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to regard China's economic development as a "threat" and "challenge" and try to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain to "delink" China from the world economy.
The white paper points out that all-round opening to the outside world creates more opportunities for all countries to share the "China dividend".
China unswervingly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy and realizes a stronger and higher level of opening-up to the outside world. China has the most potential consumer market in the world. China is the most attractive investment destination, and "going out" on a larger scale benefits more countries.
"Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and one-sided.
Mutual benefit can last for a long time."
The white paper says that China is committed to continuously expanding imports, relaxing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights. Other countries should also expand opening-up, take corresponding measures and strive to improve their business environment.
Only if all parties move towards each other can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, and form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods to the international community.
These include promoting high-quality joint construction of the "Belt and Road", building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
"China's development has benefited from the international community and has never forgotten to give back to the international community and provide more and better public goods to the international community."
In a recent written interview with Xinhua News Agency, Andrei Slipniov, general manager of the Russian Export Center, said that Russia is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize the export structure and promote the diversification of Russia's exports to China.
Slipniov pointed out that forestry, machinery manufacturing and chemical industries account for a considerable proportion of Russia's exports to China. At the same time, the export of agricultural products is also very important, including oil products, meat products and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russia's exports of non-raw materials and non-energy products to China have also shown a good and stable development trend.
Referring to the optimization of Russia's export structure to China, Slipniov said that Russia has set the task of expanding the export of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products from all countries and regions of the world, including China.
Next, Russia will improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote the further growth of the number of high-tech enterprises.
Slipniov said that Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China and develop cooperation with China in the fields of pharmaceuticals and aviation manufacturing.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russia's products in many fields are "superior in quality and competitive in price" compared with their Western counterparts.
Referring to the goal of the two countries to achieve a bilateral trade volume of US$200 billion by 2024, Slipniov said that the fields of agriculture, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving this goal.
DESIGN: To conduct a step-by-step multiple regression analysis of the survey data of Chinese nurses employed in tertiary hospitals in June and July 2017.
Methods: 298 (85.1%) of the 350 Chinese nurses were investigated using the organizational ethical atmosphere scale and the nurse service behavior scale.
The data are statistically analyzed by descriptive statistics, validation factor analysis, correlation coefficient (Pearson) and double-tail t test, and the assumptions put forward are tested by step-by-step multiple regression analysis.
Use SPSS and AMOS to analyze the data.
Results: there was a significant statistical correlation between EC and nurses' out-of-role service behavior (ERSB) and overall service behavior, and the employment type of nurses could moderate the above relationship.
Conclusion: Medical institutions should pay attention to fostering an organizational ethical atmosphere and implement a new incentive mechanism, so as to better encourage nurses to provide out-of-role service behavior.
White Paper: China takes a development path in line with national conditions
BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the State Council of China released the white paper "China and the World in the New Era" on Sept. 27.
The white paper points out that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have arduously explored and forged ahead, successfully opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieved development achievements that have attracted worldwide attention.
The white paper says that China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development depends on the practical spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing". Generations of people galloped and continued to struggle, paying hard work and sweat that others could not imagine. It depends on the spirit of "carrying your own burden". Regardless of prosperity or adversity, do not export problems, do not pass on contradictions, and do not develop themselves through forced buying and selling or plundering other countries. Relying on the exploratory spirit of "crossing the river by touching stones", we do not follow the old path of imperialism and colonialism or copy the development model of Western countries, but combine China's reality, summarize experiences and lessons, learn from human civilization, dare to try and take a path of our own.
According to the white paper, China is developing in contact and interaction with the world. China's development has injected positive energy into world peace and development. China's path conforms to China's national conditions and meets the requirements of the times.
China takes practical action to maintain world peace.
Over the past 70 years, China has not voluntarily provoked any war or conflict, and has not encroached on an inch of other countries' land.
The white paper points out that over the past 70 years, China's development has achieved great success. The fundamental reason is to find the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and unswervingly follow this path.
Standing at the "crossroads" of global textile transformation and upgrading, Sun Ruizhe said, "In order for the industry to achieve sustainable development and common prosperity, it needs the active participation of global textile people, their respective talents and the sharing of interests."
At the meeting, representatives of the textile industry of 45 countries and regions jointly issued the World Declaration on cloth merchants, jointly expounding the development goals and vision of the global textile industry.
The World Declaration on cloth merchants pointed out that, facing the future, relevant countries will adhere to openness and synergy, continuously promote the interconnection between industry and the market and jointly improve the development level of the industrial chain; will adhere to the drive of science and technology, continuously strengthen basic research, applied research and technological transformation, and jointly improve the basic ability of the industry; will focus on fashion change, give full play to the role of textile and clothing as a cultural carrier and a bridge of civilization, and jointly enhance the cultural value of the industry.
Loureno Bartholomei, president of the Brazilian Association of Fashion Designers, said in an interview that the publication of the World Declaration on cloth merchants will help all countries to jointly raise the level of development of the textile industry chain and realize the sustainable development of the textile industry.
As an example, Loureno Bartholomei mentioned that the Brazilian Association of Fashion Designers has more than 130 high-end local ready-to-wear brands. Designers are committed to designing stylish and high-end ready-to-wear products, while Keqiao has a variety of fine fabrics. "Through this cloth merchants' conference, we also look forward to establishing contacts with Keqiao's excellent suppliers and seeking more cooperation opportunities."
As the venue of the World Congress of cloth merchants, Keqiao has the largest textile market in the world. At present, with its unique textile industry chain, it is gradually building a new pattern of upgrading its internal gear and expanding its opening to the outside world, representing China's textile image at the forefront of the world.
Shen Zhijiang, Party Secretary of Keqiao District, said that Keqiao will take this conference as an opportunity to promote the textile industry in a more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win direction as a pioneer.

Iron carrier is a substance of chelating iron secreted by microorganisms at low iron concentration in the cell. It can be divided into three categories: catechol salts, oximetic acid salts and carboxylic acid salts.
The transport of iron carriers is regulated by three mechanisms: Fur, σ factor and group induction signal.
In recent years, iron carriers have been used in the fields of oil pollution repair, heavy metal pollution repair and pulp biological bleaching, and have attracted wide attention.
This paper reviews the classification of iron carriers and their transfer control mechanism, as well as the application of iron carriers in environmental pollution control and repair, and looks forward to the future application prospect of iron carriers.
The use of energy control model in nutritional epidemiology research can exclude the mixed effect of total energy intake from dietary component intake and explore the real relationship between dietary component intake and research outcome.
This paper introduces four energy control models: the standard multivariate model, the nutrient residual model, the energy decomposition model and the multi-nutrient density model.
Taking the research data of the National Health and Nutrition Survey of the United States as an example, various energy control models are used to analyze the relationship between saturated fatty acid intake and total cause mortality, and compare the analysis results of different energy control models.
The analysis shows that the results of various energy control models are basically the same, all of which can better control the influence of energy intake level.
The completion of Tianjin Zhou Dafu, the first tallest building in northern China, has created more than 100 national patent achievements

China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand also held an exchange meeting on law enforcement cooperation in Chiang Sheng, Thailand. They briefed each other on the recent situation of various countries in border management, combating drug crimes and the security situation in the Mekong River basin, held consultations and exchanges on strengthening information exchange, research and law enforcement cooperation, and reached a consensus. They also organized cultural and sports exchange activities among the four countries to carry out competitions such as football, rattan ball, iron ball and tug-of-war, so as to effectively enhance mutual understanding among law enforcement team members and the friendship of law enforcement cooperation among the four countries.
The relevant person-in-charge of the Water Patrol Unit of the Public Security Department of Yunnan Province introduced that after the end of this operation, China and Laos will continue to carry out a 10-day joint training and segmented joint patrol mission, raise the police rate of the Mekong River and make every effort to maintain the security and stability of the Mekong River basin.
The commander-in-chief of the Thai side said that since the launch of the Mekong River Joint Patrol Law Enforcement, China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand have had close exchanges, deepened practical cooperation and achieved fruitful results in many fields such as law enforcement security cooperation and cultural exchanges.
It is hoped that the law enforcement cooperation of the four parties will continue to deepen and expand, strive to open up a new situation of law enforcement cooperation among the four countries, and make a new contribution to maintaining the security and stability of the Mekong River basin.
Purpose
By comparing with the traditional minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO), the difference of 3D printing-assisted MIPO in the treatment of different types of tibial fractures against poor tibial rotation was discussed.
Methodology
Using a forward-looking randomized controlled study, 120 patients with unilateral tibial fractures admitted from January 2016 to October 2018 who met the selection criteria (40 cases each of AO types A, B and C), patients with the same type of fractures were randomly divided into the research group (20 cases, 3D printing-assisted MIPO) and the control group (20 cases, traditional MIPO) at a ratio of 1:1.
Compared with the general data such as sex, age and fracture location of patients in the same fracture classification study group and the control group, the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
A CT scan was performed within 1 week after operation and the rotation angle of the bilateral tibial bone was measured. The difference between the affected side and the healthy side was calculated. Those with an absolute difference of more than 10° were defined as poor tibial rotation.
To compare the degree of tibial rotation and the incidence of bad tibial rotation in patients with various types of tibial fractures after two techniques.
Results
An infection occurred in one case after operation and improved after drug exchange and anti-inflammatory treatment. There were no complications such as loosening and displacement of internal fixation.
After operation, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the difference of bilateral tibial rotation angle in type A patients (t = 0.559, P = 0.580). The difference of bilateral tibial rotation angle in the control group of type B and C patients was significantly greater than that in the study group (P < 0.05).
There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of tibial rotation types between the two groups in patients with the same type of fracture (P > 0.05).
There was no bad tibial rotation in both groups of type A patients, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of bad tibial rotation in type B patients (P = 1.000), and the incidence of bad tibial rotation in the control group of type C patients was significantly higher than that in the study group (P = 0.044).
Conclusion
For type A tibial fractures, 3D printing-assisted MIPO has the same anti-tibial rotation adverse effect as traditional MIPO; for type B and C tibial fractures, 3D printing-assisted MIPO has significantly better anti-tibial rotation adverse effect than traditional MIPO, and the more complex the fracture type, the more significant the advantage.
On the 25th, Iranian Defence Minister Amir Khatami expressed his opposition to any agreement with the West on Iran's missile program.
The Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency quoted Khatami as saying that any agreement with the United States on Iran's "missile force" will damage Iran's capabilities.
According to Khatami, Iran's leaders are all in favor of improving the missile program.
Iran and the six countries on the Iranian nuclear issue reached an agreement in 2015. The United States withdrew from this agreement last May and resumed and strengthened sanctions against Iran, trying to use extreme pressure to force Iran and the United States to renegotiate the Iran nuclear agreement in order to limit Iran's weapons programs and regional activities.
Some Western leaders used the occasion of the United Nations General Assembly to mediate tensions between the United States and Iran.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron met on the margins of the General Assembly on the 23rd.
After the meeting, the leaders of the three countries issued a joint statement urging Iran to engage in dialogue on nuclear activities, missile programs and regional security issues.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told media reporters on the 24th that Iran is willing to discuss "minor changes, additions or amendments" to the Iran nuclear agreement, provided that the United States lifts sanctions.
Objective: To evaluate the application effect of personalized pressure setting strategy pneumatic tourniquet in orthopedic limb surgery.
BACKGROUND: the personalized setting pressure of pneumatic tourniquet is lower than the standard pressure recommended in the textbook ("Operating Room Nursing" (People's Military Publishing House, 2008)).
Design: meta-analysis.
Sources: CL, WOS, PubMed, CNKI, CBM, VIP and Wan-fang DATA.
Review methods: From the date of establishment of the database to September 2017, we searched for relevant studies on the application effect of personalized pneumatic tourniquet.
Use the quality assessment method recommended in Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 (Higgins, 2011) to assess the quality of the study.
The main result is expansion pressure.
Results: We identified nine studies, including 1,200 patients.
Personalized pressure setting strategies can provide lower expansion pressure (four studies), improve hemostatic effect (six studies) and reduce the incidence of related complications (eight studies).
Conclusion: When using tourniquet in orthopedic surgery, personalized expansion pressure is recommended.
By measuring the patient's systolic pressure and the circumference of the limbs, setting pressure may be the smallest and most effective pressure.
Impact: This study aims to explore that the personalized pressure setting strategy of pneumatic tourniquet can provide low expansion pressure and high application value in orthopedic limb surgery.
However, more attention should be paid to how to unify personalized pressure setting strategies.
At the same time, the manufacturer's instructions need to be updated.
Therefore, it is recommended that large-sample multi-center high-quality randomized controlled trials be conducted in strict accordance with CONSORT standards.

"Under the White Clouds" is the fifth film directed by Professor Wang Rui, who is "full of peaches and plums". It tells the story of a couple of ordinary Mongolian herdsmen who have some kind of life predicament arising from the different pursuits of life. It is starring Mongolian actors Jiri Mutu and Tana.
It is reported that "Under the White Clouds" held two world premieres during this film festival, with release dates of October 31 and November 3, respectively.
The 32nd Tokyo International Film Festival is scheduled to be held in Roppongi, Hibiya and other venues in Tokyo from October 28 to November 5 this year. On the afternoon of September 26, the organizing committee of the film festival held a press conference and officially announced the main competition unit for the Golden Kirin Award, the "Future of Asia" unit, the "Special Hosting Works", Japanese Cinema Splash, "World Focus" and other units, as well as the list of films.
The head of the competition film selection introduced the Chinese entry film "Under the White Cloud".
Zhang Ziyi is the chairman of the international jury of the main competition unit of the film festival.
There are three Chinese-language films in the "Future of Asia" unit
In the series of units of the Tokyo International Film Festival, its important position is second only to the "Future of Asia" unit of the main competition film. Although only eight films were shortlisted, six fewer than the main competition, three Chinese-language films from mainland China and Hong Kong were shortlisted.
Two Hong Kong films are "Baby Revenge" directed by Lu Yixin, "Mai Lu Man" directed by Huang Qingxun and starring film emperor Guo Fucheng and film queen Yang Qianyan, and a mainland film is "Knight of Summer Night" directed by Yu Xing.
In addition, "Ice Peak Storm", a Sino-Japanese cooperative action adventure film directed by Yu Fei and starring Hiroshi Kakusho, Zhang Jingchu and Lin Baihong, will also be released at this film festival as a "special hospitality work".
Alice Hirose, the spokesperson of the film festival and "goddess", was absent from the press conference and delivered a video message.
Famous director Yoji Yamada.
At the press conference, Yukang Ando, president of the Tokyo International Film Festival, who just took office in August this year, Makoto Kumatsu, director of the film festival, and the heads of film selections of various units made speeches on the stage, introducing the purpose of the film festival and the films released.
As a special guest at the press conference, the opening film-the 50th work of the "Tora-San" series, "The Story of Tora-San: Welcome Back", director Yoji Yamada, two Japanese film directors shortlisted for the main competition unit, Makoto Tezuka ("Balopora"), Ashikaga ("Comedy Love Wife Story"), and famous playwright and screenwriter Kazuki Nakajima also appeared at the press conference to tell the feelings of participating in the Tokyo Film Festival.
The international jury of the main competition unit consists of five members. The chairman of the jury is Zhang Ziyi of China. The other four are American producer Bill Gerber, French actor and producer Julie Gaye, Danish director Michael Noel and Japanese director Ryuichi Hiroki.
In addition, the TIFFCOM (International Image Market), held in conjunction with the Tokyo International Film Festival, was held at the Sunshine City Convention and Exhibition Center in Ikebukuro from October 22 to 24. This year, a record 401 groups will set up exhibition booths. In particular, the number of exhibition units from China will reach 90, a sharp increase of 6.4 times compared with 14 last year.
To this end, TIFFCOM specially designated October 22, the opening day, as "China Day (CHINA DAY)", held a number of lectures, seminars and so on, and invited Japanese director Yu Ishii to also participate in relevant activities. The welcome dinner that evening was also co-hosted by China and Japan.
Chengdu "Panda Planet" and Giant Panda Breeding Research Base expansion project starts
Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 27 (Reporter Li Qianwei) enriches the panda culture theme tourism route, and the panda base can accommodate 180 pandas in the future. The expansion project of "Panda Planet" and giant panda breeding research base officially began in Chengdu on the 25th, which means that the "Panda Capital" project planned to be built in Chengdu was officially launched.
According to the plan, the "Panda Capital" built in Chengdu consists of three regions: North Lake District, Dujiangyan District and Longquanshan District, covering an area of 69 square kilometers.
The plan organically combines the ecological and cultural value of the giant panda with the urban construction of Chengdu's beautiful and livable park to build the ecological home of the giant panda.
"Panda Planet" belongs to the North Lake District, covering an area of 35 square kilometers. Combined with industrial planning, it will form a regional spatial structure of "1 + N + X".
One core attraction is the reconstruction and expansion project of the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base; the construction of N cultural tourism consumption scenes, namely Panda Town, Easy Garden, Dream Garden, etc.; and X regional infrastructure facilities.
After the reconstruction and expansion of Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Base, the scale will reach 3,525 acres. It is generally positioned as a world-class giant panda protection demonstration site, where people and animals share good times.
The park is planned to accommodate 180 giant pandas and their accompanying animals (red pandas and golden monkeys).
According to the China Voice News and Newspaper Summary of the Central Radio and Television General Station, over the past few days, a number of international dignitaries and envoys from various countries have congratulated the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China and highly valued the development achievements of New China and its importance to global development.
Malian President Keita said in an interview with a reporter from Central Radio and Television that he has visited China many times. China's development achievements over the past 70 years have been amazing and have benefited the world.
Keita: I am a friend and sincere friend of the Chinese people.
China has never developed selfishly, but has opened its doors to the world and brought the greatest happiness to the people of all countries in the world.
We hope that China will succeed in everything, and I hope that President Xi Jinping will lead the great Chinese people to continue to realize their dreams.
Happy birthday and best wishes to China!
Prime Minister Motley of Barbados said: Happy birthday to the People's Republic of China.
Say hello to the Chinese people.
I will never forget this day, because it is also my birthday.
A few days ago (25th), ambassadors to China from more than 130 countries and representatives of international organizations in China visited "the brilliant achievements of the great process-a large-scale achievement exhibition to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China" in Beijing.
Russian Ambassador to China Denisov said: Seeing first-hand the starting point of China's reform and opening-up policy, compared with the situation today and more than 40 years ago, the progress is too great.
In addition, in recent days, our embassies and consulates in many countries have also held various activities in the region to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China with local friendly people.
Many foreign friends have sent heartfelt blessings to China.
On September 26, Baidu announced that it would start the trial operation of Robotaxi, an unmanned "Class 4" fully self-driving taxi team, on a specific highway in Changsha, Hunan Province.
Self-driving start-up Xiaoma Zhixing also launched a trial operation in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province.
The trial operation of self-driving taxis supported by the Chinese government may be expanded in various places.
Since 26, Baidu has used 45 self-driving taxis for trial operation. Passengers in Changsha can apply for rides through a dedicated website.
There is a "safety officer" in the driver's seat to ensure the safety of passengers.
The road providing trial operation will be 50 km by the end of 2019 and is scheduled to be extended to 135 km by the first half of 2020.
The vehicle is the pure electric vehicle "Red Flag EV" of China FAW Group, equipped with the system developed by the "Apollo Program" established by Baidu and supported by the Chinese government.
In addition to Toyota and Honda, Baidu's Apollo program was attended by more than 150 companies, including Volkswagen of Germany, Daimler of Germany, Ford Motor of the United States, Intel of the United States, Microsoft of the United States and Nvidia of the United States.
Around China's self-driving taxis, China's largest online contract car service provider has announced plans to launch 30 self-driving taxi services on the outskirts of Shanghai within the year.
China's competition for self-driving development may become more intense.
Taiwan scholars suggest: "uncertain era" Taiwan businessmen need to keep up with the mainland to develop mainstream industries
The "2019 Taiwan Business Innovation Business Model Forum" was held in Taipei for two days on 26 and 27.
The event invited a number of Taiwan business representatives and scholars to share their experiences on enterprise transformation, innovation, succession and market development.
The forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Management and Management and co-organized by Qunyi Jinding Securities, Outstanding Mainland Taiwan Business Association and other organizations.
The two-day meeting was divided into a number of seminars such as transformation and upgrading mode and business strategy, which were attended by more than 100 people.
Chen Mingzhang, president of the Taipei Institute of Management and Management, said that the trade friction between China (mainland China) and the United States continues, and Taiwan businessmen face an "uncertain era".
He believes that Taiwan businessmen need to keep pace with the times and keep up with the mainstream industries developed in the mainland, paying particular attention to innovative products related to the fields of science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"In the past, Taiwan businessmen valued quality, effectiveness and delivery."
Chen Mingzhang believes that the above-mentioned conditions for Taiwan businessmen alone are not enough at the moment.
He pointed out that Taiwan-funded enterprises should have both speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and attach importance to extended service and life product service.
In addition, "service value added" is also a new area that Taiwan businessmen can vigorously develop.
At the speech session of the representative of Taiwan businessmen, Xu Wentang, chairman of Taiwan businessman Yayi Electronics Co. Ltd. from Guangdong, introduced that Yayi Electronics had experienced operational difficulties due to the sharp decline in orders. The group began to improve its business situation from many aspects such as adjusting its structure and revitalizing its assets.
It took three years for enterprises to realize their revenue by taking away the traditional electrical business, transforming vehicle electronic equipment and entering the intelligent household appliances industry.
Bai Hongzhang, general manager of Sun God (Zhuhai) Electronics Co., Ltd., suggested that if it is difficult to develop new customers, it would be better to focus on the original customers to provide "one-stop" services.
The replacement of suppliers by customers is nothing more than six factors: poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery speed, few varieties and integrity problems. As long as these six points are solved, together with the timely transformation of production lines and the expansion of product categories, enterprises will become irreplaceable suppliers for customers.
On the 27th, the "2019 Outstanding Mainland Taiwan Business Award" award ceremony, also hosted by the Taipei Institute of Management and Management, was held in Taipei.
According to Taiwan's Economic Daily, Lu Zhengzhang, general manager of Golden Land Company, whose operations center is located in Shanghai, won the "Outstanding Taiwan Business and Cross-Strait Contribution Award".
New regulation solicits opinions: social capital needs qualification to obtain rural land management right
Social capital needs qualification to obtain rural land management right
The Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights publicly solicited opinions and proposed to supervise the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to acquire land management rights
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published a notice on the "Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights (Consultation Draft of the Revised Draft)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Opinion Draft") for public consultation, which increased the supervision and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to acquire land management rights.
The Opinion Draft is now open to the public for comments.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contracting Law, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the "separation of powers" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the "Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Contracting and Management Rights" and formed the "Opinion Draft".
The reporter of Beijing Youth Daily learned that the "Opinion Draft" published for the first time has a number of important changes.
The newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracting clarifies the scope of land transfer and implements the concept of "three-power distribution". The special section sets up "land contract management right" and "land management right" respectively, making a clear distinction between the transfer of land contract management right, the exchange of land contract management right and the transfer of land management right (leasing, subcontracting, equity participation or other means).
In this Opinion Draft, in order to implement the concept of "separation of powers", effectively respond to the main thrust of the amendment to the Rural Land Contracting Law, and take into account that the transfer of land management rights and the exchange and transfer of land contract management rights are quite different in terms of parties, procedures and supervision, this revised draft defines the scope of transfer, focusing on the transfer of land management rights. The transfer methods include leasing and equity participation. The name of the regulations will be changed from the "Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Contract Management Rights" to the "Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights".
The transfer and exchange of land contract management rights will be regulated by separate administrative measures.
The Opinion Draft points out that under the background of "separation of powers", farmers only have the right to land management for a certain period of time.
In theory, even in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, farmers only have the risk of losing their right to operate for a certain period of time. Therefore, stipulating the return of the contracted land to the original contractor is no longer necessary in jurisprudence and conflicts with the Bankruptcy Law.
Aiming at the problem of preventing the risk of farmers losing their land, methods such as preferred shares, first rent and then shares and repurchase have emerged in practice.
Considering that preferred stock has a mature theoretical discussion in company law, it is suggested to take it as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of equity loss.

In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that can access raw location data may have serious privacy problems.
However, not all systems with their own central servers need access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that use only central servers to communicate with each other have now been created (see below for details).
South Korea has introduced a system that is not application-based to perform contact tracing tasks.
Instead of using specialized applications, the system chose to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine this information to send notifications to potential infected people through text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the government has also been allowed to disclose location information, as the country has made major adjustments to its information privacy law following the outbreak of the MERS epidemic.
The public can access this information through many applications and websites. Other countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, no specific details have been released.
Privacy Protection Close Contact Tracking is a recognized concept. A large number of relevant research literature dates back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were studying privacy protection solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Power Consumption (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordinated scheme that includes a centralized and decentralized approach. It is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, formerly known as contact event number (CEN)), privacy-sensitive protocol and mobile contact tracking mechanism (PACT).
Under these agreements, identifiable personal data will never leave the device, and all matches are made on the device.
The privacy team at the MIT Media Lab has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or path cross-data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the research content of the white paper "Application rogueization: safeguarding personal privacy in an epidemic", released in March 2020. In addition, Enigma MPC, a company originally founded at the MIT Media Lab and committed to developing privacy technology, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to support users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, some groups jointly formed the Global TCN Alliance around essentially the same methods and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmented information and supporting the global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, which is a key to achieving wide application.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that its official government application uses the open source BlueTrace protocol.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, respectively, announced a close contact tracking plan, claiming that the plan combines Bluetooth low-power technology with privacy protection encryption technology to protect privacy.
In addition, they published the core technical specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be rolled out in three phases:
Launch tools to support the government in creating official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
By integrating this feature directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to launch the system first through operating system updates. After the epidemic threat, the system will be deleted in the same way to solve the follow-up monitoring problem.
Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is the act of cleaning the hands to remove dust, grease, microbes or other useless substances from the hands.
Insisting on washing hands with soap at certain "critical moments" of the day can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which can be transmitted through fecal-oral channels.
If people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold.
COVID-19 is mainly concentrated in Hubei and surrounding areas for sexual transmission.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic regeneration number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the time of large-scale population movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of confirmed cases is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (≥60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large envelope virus subfamily containing single justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely α, β, γ and δ, of which α-CoV and β-CoV are known to infect humans.
The encapsulated thorn glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV binds to its cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide-based peptidase 4 (DPP4), and then undergoes membrane fusion.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is replicated, the genome RNA, together with envelope glycoprotein and nuclear capsid protein, forms a vesicle containing the viral body, then fuses with the plasma membrane and releases the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of β-CoV. Of the 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, where the initial outbreak occurred, the genetic consistency exceeded 99.98%.
Compared to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra-thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
The study found that human ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, compared with SARS-CoV, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a weak binding force to human ACE2, which is consistent with the fact that the severity of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new type of short protein encoded by orf3b and a secretory protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFN β; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. Reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2, which forms a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1, with a resolution of 2.9 A.
They found that the complex had an open and closed conformation and was assembled into a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing evidence of CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through beavers and camels, respectively.
By comparing the systematic development of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% consistent with the two SARS-like CoVs from bats, called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, respectively.
However, it is unclear what intermediate hosts help the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and its transmission path has yet to be clarified.
Ji et al. Suggest that snakes are carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involves homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe that pangolin is a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, given that a CoV found in pangolin, a long-snouted anteater often used in traditional Chinese medicine, has 99% genetic homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a huge difference; therefore, concrete evidence has yet to provide decisive results (Figure (Fig.33)).
The physical and chemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to five days at 20°C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may be of a similar nature.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat-56°C 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but chlorine is determined not to effectively inactivate the virus.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so they are susceptible to this new virus.
At present, there is no detailed research report on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Fig.4).4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is first identified by the host's inherent immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Viruses induce inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis through different pathways, which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus get rid of the immune response.
The adaptive immune response will join the fight against the virus in the near future.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Auxiliary T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help these defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, including complements -- such as C3a and C5a -- and antibodies, is also critical to resisting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients can neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system can produce a large number of free radicals locally. These free radicals may cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, lead to multi-organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by aggregation, is more likely to affect the elderly and pregnant women with multiple complications.
Typically, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impaired immune function have a higher chance of infection than others.
According to a study of the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that according to the demographics of 8,866 cases, the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health sector, it is very important to adjust the effective isolation time according to the most accurate incubation period, which can prevent asymptomatic infected people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a rule, people who come into contact with the virus or are infected usually need to be isolated for 14 days.
Should the isolation period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and first symptom of COVID-19. It can be without any other symptoms. It can also be accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, pharynx pain, running water, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have difficulty breathing and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
Severe cases can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis shock, metabolic acidosis and clotting dysfunction.
Even if there are no lung imaging abnormalities, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of various symptoms was: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55%, diarrhea 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies on family aggregation and asymptomatic individual transmission leading to aggregation reported similar results.
In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of these patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with the higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and pharynx pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, it has been proved that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and pharynx pain (13-25%) are the main symptoms, and about 14%-20% of patients need ventilation support.
As of February 14, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 66,576, with a mortality rate of 2%.
By comparison, as of November 2002, the death rate of SARS among 8,096 confirmed cases was 10%.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An early study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data show that the diffusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Aggregation usually occurs in the same family or from the same party or means of transportation, such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a travel or residence history in Wuhan or other epidemic areas in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease, or a history of close contact with the infected person or patient.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, thus issuing an alert to extend the isolation time.
The number of peripheral blood leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in patients in the early stages of the disease is normal or reduced.
For example, lymphocytosis with a white blood cell count of <4×109/L -- including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/L -- increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viral blood disease were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients can see an increase in the level of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood. Most patients can see an increase in blood C-reactive protein and blood sink.
Severe patients can see an increase in the level of D-dimer, a blood fibrin degradation product, and a progressive decrease in lymphocyte count.
Most patients with COVID-19 can see abnormal chest imaging, which is characterized by bilateral patchy shadows or glass-grinding shadows in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid build-up and progressive fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange.
Type I and type II alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction can reduce surfactant levels and increase surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lung to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst chest imaging findings usually occur at the same time as the worst of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 found alveolar epithelial cell loss, transparent membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and polynuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathological manifestations of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, as the high false negative rate may accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical manifestations for diagnosis on February 13, 2020 (instead of relying solely on RT-PCR).
A similar situation occurred during the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, combining medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination and imaging results is essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Zhang Feng's team reported a scheme to detect SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology. The scheme does not require complex instruments. Using a test paper, synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments with concentrations of only 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies of the virus per micro-liter) can be detected in less than an hour.
If verified in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.
Due to the lack of experience in treating the new type of CoV, doctors mainly provide support treatment for patients with COVID-19, while trying various treatments that have been used or proposed for other CoVs -- such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV -- and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2). 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments, such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It is even recommended that the plasma of recovered patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially primarily attacks the lungs, but may also attack other organs that express ACE2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a number of cases of unexplained pneumonia, and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, so the new crown virus is considered to be a human-animal disease.
The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first patients found were later confirmed to have developed the disease on December 1, 2019, and there was no obvious link to the subsequent batch of cases in the South China seafood market.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China seafood market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report, saying that the first case may date back to November 17, 2019. The patient is a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, according to the World Health Organization, the number of newly reported cases in China decreased, but the number of newly reported cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea suddenly increased significantly, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially mild cases.
As of February 26, relatively few cases of adolescents had been reported, with only 2.4% of adolescents aged 19 and under worldwide. Patrick Valance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimates that about 60% of the UK population needs to be infected with the new crown virus in order to obtain effective group immunization.
The number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be positive according to the official program.
As of March 23, the proportion of groups tested in all countries in the world did not exceed 3% of the total population. Many countries have also issued official policies not to test people with mild diseases, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
According to a study published on March 16, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infected people in China had not been tested, and these undocumented infected people were the source of 79% of recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, it is estimated that the actual number of infections in Italy far exceeds the number of reported cases.
The basic infectious number (R0) of COVID-19 was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that R0 may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 can recover.
The time between onset and death of patients who cannot recover is 6-41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 people had died from COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80% of the deaths in China were among people over the age of 60, and 75% of the deaths were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official statistics of COVID-19 deaths usually refer to those who, according to the official scheme, tested positive for the new crown virus.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may far exceed the statistics, as the data may not include patients who have not been tested, such as those who have died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times the official number of deaths from new crown virus pneumonia.
A spokeswoman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted: "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual value", and the rumor that the United States data is underestimated also confirms this statement. Underestimation often occurs in the field of epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. On January 9, 2020, the first confirmed death case in China occurred in Wuhan.
On February 1, the first death outside China occurred in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first death outside Asia occurred in France.
As of February 28, there were more than a dozen deaths outside China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported death cases. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region and change over time and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as test measurements, the quality of the health system, treatment programs, the time of the first outbreak of the epidemic and age, sex and overall health status. The case fatality rate is the result of dividing the number of deaths in a given period of time by the number of confirmed cases.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global case fatality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
Mortality rates vary from region to region.
In China, the estimated case fatality rate fell from 17.3% (patients who fell ill from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (patients who fell ill after February 1, 2020). Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR) and infection mortality rate (IFR). The former reflects the number of disease deaths as a percentage of the number of people diagnosed, while the latter reflects the number of disease deaths as a percentage of the number of people infected (including the number of people diagnosed and those not diagnosed).
The Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee subsequently issued a notice on December 31 and reported it to the World Health Organization.
After receiving reports of numerous cases of unexplained pneumonia, the Wuhan health department launched an investigation in early January. In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
From the beginning of January to mid-January 2020, under the influence of China's Spring Festival population movement and Wuhan as a transportation hub and major railway hub, the virus spread to other provinces of China.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States had more confirmed cases than China and Italy, making it the country with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, a cumulative total of more than 1.61 million confirmed cases had been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 deaths had been reported and more than 364,000 cases had been cured.
About 200 countries and regions around the world have reported confirmed cases.
Affected by the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen Area have adopted prevention and control measures to restrict the free movement of people and establish border controls.
National-level response measures include containment, such as isolation (also known as home orders, on-site asylum orders or blockades) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the total population, were under some form of blockade, more than 50 million people in the Philippines were under blockade, about 59 million people in South Africa were under blockade and 1.3 billion people in India were under blockade.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were under some form of blockade. Two days later, this number increased to 2.6 billion, accounting for about one third of the global population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report speculates that the earliest case can be traced back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian found a number of unexplained cases of pneumonia on December 26. His hospital reported the situation to the Jianghan District Disease Prevention and Control Center in Wuhan on December 27.
On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronaviruses were found in a preliminary genetic test of the patient's sample.
The Wuhan Municipal Health and Hygiene Commission issued a notice on December 31,
Reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.
After these notices were issued, several doctors in Wuhan were reprimanded by the police for walking "rumors" of the epidemic.
Dilip Gosh, chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature, "so God will retaliate against them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as "wrong". In China, the xenophobia and racial discrimination suffered by non-Chinese residents have also been exacerbated by the pandemic. Foreigners have been described as "foreign garbage" and should be the target of "garbage disposal".
Many newspapers with paywalls have removed paywall restrictions for some or all of their coverage of the new coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have publicly published some scientific papers related to the epidemic.
Other scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

B Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-evaluation, redistribution or treatment conversion) refers to the conversion of an approved drug to other uses to treat a disease or medical condition different from its original research and development purpose.
This is currently a scientific research route for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment method.
Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and recovery plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be used in pharmaceuticals, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable scheme for the development of effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 protein.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.
Seven trials were evaluated and approved for use in the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The conversion of antiviral drugs accounts for the vast majority of research in China. Nine Phase III clinical trials on Redcivir will be conducted in many countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently being evaluated, including Redcivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, Lopinave/Litonave and Lopinave/Litonave combination interferon beta.
As of March 2020, the efficacy of Redcivir has been preliminarily confirmed.
After observation, it was found that the clinical symptoms of patients treated with compassionate drug Redcivir were alleviated.
At present, the United States, China and Italy are conducting Phase III clinical trials. In February 2020, China launched a study on chloroquine (previously used to treat malaria) and obtained preliminary results.
However, there were calls for a peer review of the study.
South Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1 g a day, while reminding that twice the dose is very dangerous and may even be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to use the two drugs to treat patients with COVID-19. The seventh edition of China's guidelines also proposes the use of interferon, ribavirin or abidol hydrochloride to treat COVID-19.
Preliminary data show that high doses of ribavirin have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
After confirming the low concentration inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to use nitrozonit for further in vivo research. The research shows that the primitive spiny protein caused by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a necessary condition for the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors into the human body.
Whether or not used in combination with azithromycin, there are serious limitations in the study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These treatments cannot be accepted by the medical community unless further research is carried out. Oseltamivir has no inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has not yet been found to have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
Cytokine storms may become a complication of later treatment in patients with severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. After completing a small study, China's National Health and Health Commission included tozhu monoclonal antibody in the treatment guidelines.
Following the positive test results of seriously ill patients, Italy is conducting phase 2 non-randomized trials at the national level.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests, the identification of cytokine storms is aimed at curbing the development of the disease, and cytokine storms are thought to lead to the death of some infected people.
In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, the FDA approved the use of interleukin 6 receptor antagonists to treat steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, or CAR T cell therapy, caused by other causes.
So far, there is no randomized controlled evidence that Tozhu monoclonal antibody can effectively treat CRS.
At present, studies are under way to extract purified concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of COVID-19 rehabilitated persons and inject them into people in need of antibodies as passive immune therapy until the vaccine is successfully developed.
This strategy was tried during the SARS epidemic, but the efficacy is inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is an expected mechanism for passive antibody therapy to mediate the immune defense of SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis can achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are being developed, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies.
The amount of serum produced during rehabilitation may increase, which is conducive to rapid deployment. The serum consists of the liquid part of the blood of the rehabilitated patient, which contains specific antibodies against the virus.

Since this month, we have encountered some difficult circumstances.
In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we clearly feel the solidarity of the fate of all mankind and at the same time realize our responsibilities to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best response to such challenges requires people around the world to empathize, work together and promote community-building, which is the core concept of Wikimedia.
All colleagues convey fraternity and care to each other through e-mail, telephone and chat, which fully proves the extraordinaryness of our colleagues and how fortunate we are to work with you.
I am extremely grateful and proud to be colleagues with you.
Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is that the world can use Wikipedia at this moment. At the same time, they also made me realize the symbolic power that maintaining the normal operation of this key resource brings to people all over the world.
Whether your work is responsible for website operation, salary payment or community security, the normal operation of Wikimedia is inseparable from your hard work.
Now more than ever, the world needs the information provided by Wikipedia.
At this stage, the content of our work and even the way we work will have an important impact on the world.
In view of the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities shouldered by colleagues, we will make some important adjustments to the way we collaborate from next week.
Adjustments to working methods and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss the company's working methods and timetable for the next few days to months.
At the meeting, we considered what we considered to be an appropriate response to the current challenges facing the company, as well as best practices to ensure that the company maintains sustainable development during the epidemic.
The executive team agreed to relieve the pressure on the company's employees so that everyone can support the company's mission for a long time.
We support you in properly reducing the pressure of your work.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours a day (or 20 hours a week). Any subsequent changes will be notified separately.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer hours every day, we will arrange tasks for you according to your working hours.
However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as taking care of your family, going shopping or seeing a doctor.
We will not track your working hours.
If you are ill, please put down your work.
Although this is self-evident, we still want to remind you, please rest assured.
You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team revise the work calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of the Talent and Culture Operations Department, which will support you and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from management.)
For hourly employees, we will pay in full.
We have expressed and recommitted ourselves to the commitments made to contractors and hourly workers.
The salary we pay to everyone will continue to be calculated on the basis of the remuneration they receive for completing their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
Even if you are sick or unable to work, it is no exception.
If you are willing to work, we will provide you with support.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through their work and release their pressure.
Our work can bring incredible returns, especially at a time like this.
But taking care of yourself is still the first priority.
We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can keep abreast of your latest situation and make adjustments accordingly.
Priority is given to safeguarding important work.
We must maintain the normal functioning of some important work.
The work carried out by the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operation team, the trust and security team and the fundraising team (and other teams) is critical and may require additional support.
We will begin to work with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting some matters that are critical to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important items.
A temporary slowdown will not affect future development.
We do not intend to "work overtime to catch up" after the outbreak.
We won't ask you to work overtime to catch up with the schedule, because it seems impractical now.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.
How will the APP (annual plan) change?
In order to adapt to the new realities and daily working time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.
We hope to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time for budgeting to enable employees to prioritize critical work and take care of themselves and their families, and to adjust work arrangements for employees who need or want to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.
Extending the schedule can significantly reduce the current planned workload of the organization as a whole and reduce work pressure.
We will submit the above proposal to the board of directors next week. If the proposal is adopted, we will update the follow-up working arrangements to delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thank the APP team for their leadership in this process.
The FDA has approved a detection method that uses nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this method does not require a series of temperature-changing cycles, positive results can be obtained in only 5 minutes and negative results can be determined in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott is expected to increase production so that it can provide 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is developing a detection method using monoclonal antibodies (which specifically bind to the nuclear capsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus) in the hope that it will provide the test results in 15 to 20 minutes, as in the case of rapid influenza detection.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of chest films is small, and the performance of CT [computed tomography] may be obvious, even before the symptoms appear"
The typical features of CT include double lung multi-leaf grinding glass shadow, with peripheral asymmetry and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, gravel road signs and lung changes will develop.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan (the site of the initial outbreak of the current pandemic) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but the accuracy of CT is low, and many of its imaging features overlap with other pneumonia and diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommended that "CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC has recommended the use of PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about seven days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immunity of the monitored population. The determination can be carried out in the central laboratory (CLT) or through instant detection (PoCT).
Many high-throughput automatic systems in clinical laboratories can carry out the above determination, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by sequence samples, it is usually determined using a peripheral blood sample.
For PoCT, skin puncture is generally used to obtain a blood sample.
There is no need to perform extraction steps before determination, which is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the detection methods declared by 29 entities, which are now able to distribute their antibody detection kits.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one test under the emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the testing kits of Omon Medical Experimental Diagnostics AG and Epitope Diagnostics were approved in Europe. These kits can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The detection ability can detect hundreds of samples in a few hours, so the determination of viral RNA is much faster than that of traditional PCR.
In general, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody detection kits it purchased were good enough.
Hong Kong has established a mechanism for suspected patients to live at home. "Emergency rooms provide patients with sample test tubes". The patient vomits saliva into the test tube and sends the test tube back. The results will be received later. The UK NHS announced that it is piloting a home-based test for suspected cases, which will eliminate the risk of patients infecting others when they go to the hospital. It can also eliminate the risk that patients must disinfect the ambulance after using the ambulance. When conducting a car-free test for suspected cases of COVID-19, medical professionals can take appropriate preventive measures to take samples.
The drop-free testing center has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and most extensive tests than other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that non-hospitalized institutions have the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests a day, compared with 10,700 in the previous week.
If the test is carried out at the request of the doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.
According to the director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, the total detection capacity in Germany is 160,000 copies per week.
As of March 19, car-free testing has been provided in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of people tested in Germany is not known, as only the number of people who tested positive was reported.
An initial laboratory survey showed that by the 12th week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested (including the 12th week of 2020) and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing samples of 64 patients at the same time, that is, summarizing the samples and further testing only when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, Huada Gene (BGI) temporarily established a 2,000-square-meter emergency testing laboratory called "Fire Eye", which was put into use on February 5, 2020, and can handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was built in five days under the supervision of Wang Jian, founder of Huada Gene. Modeling shows that if the above-mentioned detection ability had not been achieved, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment and isolation costs would have doubled.
Following the Wuhan laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately established the Fire Eye Laboratory. At present, a total of 12 cities in China have established the laboratory.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily flux of laboratory tests will be 50,000 copies per day. The open-source, multi-channel design released by Origami Assays allows up to 1,122 patient samples to be tested for COVID19 through only 93 measurements. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for automatic fluid transfer devices.
As of March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some sponsors to explore the sample preparation scheme, which involves heating the sample to 98°C (208°F) for up to five minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on March 31 that more of its population has now been tested for the new crown virus, more people have been tested than any other country, and is expanding the level of testing to allow a large number of people to be tested.
The way to realize this detection capability is, on the one hand, to use drive-through testing, on the other hand, to fund Group 42 and Huada Gene (based on its "Fire Eye" emergency testing laboratory in China) to establish high-throughput laboratories to meet the testing needs of large-scale populations.
The laboratory was built in 14 days and can carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day. It is the first laboratory of this size in the world to operate outside China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States have all developed different detection methods for various parts of the coronavirus gene map.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test kits to send kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German method was announced on January 17, 2020; the plan developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be available until January 28, thus limiting the detection ability of the United States. Both China and the United States encountered problems with the reliability of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak. These two countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient test kits to meet the demand and the testing recommendations made by health experts.
On the contrary, experts believe that extensive testing in South Korea is very helpful in reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Thanks to the detection capacity established by the Korean government in the past few years, it is mainly concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to a very high demand for testing, which has led to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents has begun to become tight.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its testing kit.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC had "defects"; subsequently, the government removed bureaucratic obstacles to private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Yirui Biotechnology Co. Ltd. and found that the test results were inaccurate.
The company explained that the inaccurate test results may be due to the incorrect collection of samples or the erroneous use of test kits.
The Spanish cabinet said it would recover the kit that returned the wrong results and replace it with another kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% Of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China had incorrect test results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China and found them inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that the test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test boxes purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test boxes from China and announced in April 2020 that the test boxes could not be used.
Positive results can be obtained by testing, isolating those who tested positive and tracking the contact history of those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Researchers working in the city of Va, Italy, where the first COVID-19 patient died, conducted two rounds of tests on a group of about 3,400 people, each about 10 days apart.
The origin of human-animal co-morbidity of human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptability have been driving the coevolution of Coronaviruses (CoV) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two types of human coronavirus (HCoV) were known to cause minor diseases, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have turned the situation around, revealing the destructive and lethal nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has once again made CoV the focus of attention. Surprisingly, compared with its sister virus, SARS-CoV, it has strong transmission but low pathogenicity.
HCoV infection is a kind of human-animal co-morbidity. Therefore, understanding the origin of human-animal co-morbidity of HCoV will be very helpful to us.
Most HCoVs are derived from bats and are non-pathogenic.
Some intermediate storage hosts of HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts is of direct significance to the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of CoV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of human CoV.
In this review, we summarize the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, highlighting their discovery history, the origin of human-animal co-morbidity and interspecific transmission.
Importantly, we compared and compared different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
Against this background, we discussed the current epidemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, this paper also focuses on the requirements for successfully completing host conversion and the impact of virus evolution on the severity of the disease.
CoV belongs to the coronavirus family and consists of a group of just single-stranded RNA viruses with envelopes.
These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, containing between 26,000 and 32,000 bases, and are known as "coronavirus" (CoV) because of their coronal form under electron microscopy.
Structurally, CoV has a non-segmented genome that shares similar tissues.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication enzyme polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins, called nsp1-16.
The rest of the genome contains the ORF of structural proteins, including prickles (S), envelopes (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Many lineage-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by CoVs of different lineages.
Depending on the protein sequence, CoV is divided into four genera (α-CoV, β-CoV, γ-CoV and δ-CoV), of which β-CoV contains most HCoV and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most α-CoV and β-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of γ-CoV and δ-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed the species barrier, some of which have become important human pathogens.
To date, seven types of coronavirus (HCoV) are known to infect humans.
Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are α-CoV.
The other five types of β-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively large number of patients, and are more likely to develop into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
In the mid-1960s, the first strain of the HCoV-229E virus, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold.
Since then, through extensive research on two HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, both of which can cause self-limiting symptoms, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge.
In fact, before the outbreak of SARS, the concept that infection with HCoV was usually harmless was widely accepted.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen of the ongoing epidemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As of March 3, 2020, it has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm has been sounded, and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven species of HCoV have the origin of human-animal co-morbidity from bats, mice or domestic animals.
A variety of evidence shows that the evolution of all HCoVs originated in bats. The viruses in bats are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origin of human-animal co-morbidity in HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and constraints of viral species jumping.
In addition, this will guide or promote the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts and expanded animal hosts, which is of great significance to prevent future virus spills.
In this review, we outline the origin, interspecific transmission and pathogenesis of human-animal co-morbidity in HCoV.
In particular, we highlighted and explored a common topic, namely that the parent virus of HCoV is usually not pathogenic in its natural storage host, but is pathogenic after transmission across species to a new host.
In addition, we also review the trend of HCoV evolution, in which the increase of communicability is often accompanied by the decrease of pathogenicity.
Against this background, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Since the late 1930s, the animal CoV has been widely known.
Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretions of people with the common cold, medical scientists had isolated different CoVs in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven species of HCoV have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will provide us with rich information and guiding significance.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection and subsequently adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung cell strain.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat, and 10-20% of patients have fever, cough and other symptoms.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and subsequent continuous transmission of the mouse brain.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to that of HCoV-229E infection, and there is no significant difference in symptoms compared with other respiratory pathogens (such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus) infection.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in winter in temperate climates.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, after which they will develop for about two weeks.
A study of human volunteers showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E develop a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with low immune function showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history. Its pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to super-communicators, it is estimated that each case may bring about 2 secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load on the 10th day of onset.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and chills, followed by advanced symptoms such as difficulty breathing, cough and respiratory distress.
Reduced lymphocytes, abnormal liver function and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
In addition, diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages increase were observed in SARS patients.
Subsequently, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, may also be infected, often accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal in patients with low immune function.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the source patient who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immune-impaired patients with respiratory diseases.
Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis are common.
Another independent study showed that the same virus was isolated from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis (also known as Grubb's laryngitis).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be associated with acute asthma attacks.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are usually unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases. However, there have also been accidents for unknown reasons, such as a rare and more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause serious lower respiratory infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs gain the ability to spread effectively and survive in the human body, their toxicity or pathogenicity also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases come from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary transmission to close contacts.
In 2015, secondary transmission broke out again in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to that of SARS and is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also have acute renal failure, which is a unique feature of MERS in diseases caused by HCoV so far.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases had been reported, with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, patients with aggregation pneumonia were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. After retrospective analysis, they were confirmed to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern, and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed worldwide, with a crude death rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the case fatality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the case fatality rate outside Hubei is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections, manifested in fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Some patients also develop diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the homology of 82% of high nucleotide sequences, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic, but more infectious.
An asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported, which may have accelerated the rapid spread of the virus around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in community-acquired HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or even asymptomatic manifestations.
On the other hand, a small number of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infection cases, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows the interesting pattern characteristics of community-acquired HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the spreadability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoV.
On the other hand, whether the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 will decline after human transmission, like that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, remains to be verified.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
At least in some cases, whether the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in SARS-CoV remains to be clarified in future studies.
In addition, it is important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community-acquired HCoV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenicity and continuous transmission after human transmission will have an important impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have also adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both sides may be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
Both HCoV, which causes serious human diseases, and people suffering from serious HCoV diseases have died out.
To this end, HCoV must be replicated enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations to counter host limiting factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it can adapt well, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, these four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread among the population, causing people with normal immune function to develop the common cold.
These viruses do not require an animal host.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans, nor can they continue to spread in humans.
They need to survive and reproduce in human-animal co-pathogenic hosts and may seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate and expanded hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is as highly contagious as community-acquired HCoV, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it can fully adapt to humans and circulate within humans without a host or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, it is of some guiding significance to discuss the definition and characteristics of HCoV's evolutionary host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host and expanded host.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor that is highly homologous at the level of the nucleotide sequence, the animal will become the evolutionary host of HCoV.
Ancestral viruses are usually highly adaptable and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the storage host will continue to carry HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCoV is parasitic in the human body shortly after or immediately after being parasitic in the intermediate host, it will not be well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a source of human-animal co-morbidity for human infection and play a role in amplifying the host by allowing the virus to replicate briefly and then spread it to humans to expand the scale of human infection.
If HCoV cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate host, a terminal infection may occur.
On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even establish long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural storage host.
A retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that the indexed cases of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seropositivity surveys showed that animal vendors had higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) than the general population.
In the live animal market, the fruit beaver (flower beaver) and a beaver cat were found to carry the SARS-CoV-like virus almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus for the first time.
The fact that there were no further SARS reports after removing all the beavers from the market indirectly supports this view.
However, according to the report, the detection of SARS-CoV by farm beavers in the wild or not in contact with the live animal market is basically negative, indicating that the beaver may be an intermediate amplified host rather than a natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that since 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that a variety of small mammals may also act as an intermediate expanded host of SARS-CoV.
All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequently, the study of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV found a closely related bat coronavirus, known as the SARS-related chrysanthemum bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survives in the Chinese chrysanthemum bat.
These bats were positive for the SARS-CoV antibody and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human pathogens.
In addition, the researchers identified a variety of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but with the exception of a designated WIV1, no virus can be isolated as a living virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known receptor of SARS-CoV.
Experiments have shown that WIV1 extracted from bat dung samples uses bats, beavers and human ACE2 as receptors for its entry into cells.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS can neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to the bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although the two viruses are highly homologous, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct storage host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis placed MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor dipeptide peptidease 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is closer to the corresponding RNA in bat β-CoV from Europe and Africa in phylogenetics.
So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, have only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be the direct storage host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the seropositivity of single-hump camels to MERS-CoV specific neutralization antibodies is the same as that of camels originating in the Middle East in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV isolated from the nose swabs of single-hump camels is the same as the virus found in humans, further indicating that camels are the true storage hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, the symptoms are generally mild, but a large number of viruses have been observed to fall off.
It is worth noting that infected camels not only transmit the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the dung-mouth route, which is also the main way for bats to transmit the virus.
However, problems remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms appear, which may be attributed to human-to-human or unknown transmission routes, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from the chrysanthemum bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent-generation relationship.
In other words, unless almost the same bat coronavirus is found in the future, bats may not be the direct storage host of SARS-CoV-2.
It is speculated that among the wildlife species that the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be sold and slaughtered at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, many of the initial COVID-19 cases are related to it, indicating that animal-to-human transmission may have occurred.
Several recent studies based on macro genome sequencing have shown that an endangered small mammal known as pangolin (Malay pangolin) may also carry the ancestor β-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin coronavirus genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with about 90% homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
In the phylogenetic tree, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2-like virus subfamilies, one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and has 97.4% amino acid sequence homology.
In sharp contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more different, although their genome-wide sequence homology is higher.
An earlier study on diseased pangolin also reported the detection of virus overlap groups from lung samples, which also had a similar relationship with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different assembly methods and manual processing to obtain part of the genome sequence that accounts for about 86.3% of the virus's total genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the differences in the β-CoV sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the β-CoV associated with pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolin and other mammals has yet to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the β-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 associated with SARS-CoV-2 have the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It can be highly speculated that the high similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV and SARS-CoV-2's RBD is caused by selectively mediated convergent evolution.
Another contrary view is that the beta-CoV and RaTG13 associated with pangolin SARS-CoV-2 are recombined in a third species of wildlife.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoV.
At present, there is no conclusion on the origin of direct human-animal co-morbidity of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the researchers also studied the origin of human-animal co-morbidity in HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the bat coronavirus, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.
According to the report, the bat coronavirus known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in three-color bats in North America shows a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008), of which camelids are also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
For the sake of clarity, Figure 1 and Table 2 summarize the existing knowledge of the known animal origin of HCoV.
Phylogenetic analysis provides evidence for the interspecific transmission events of HCoV in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from livestock across species, there was a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases.
The interspecific transmission history of HCoV-229E is unclear.
The bat α-CoV, closely related to HCoV-229E, has been found.
A type of alpaca α-CoV appears between the two.
There are several pieces of evidence to support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not llamas, may come into contact with bats in a common ecological niche.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Secondly, the bat α-CoV associated with HCoV-229E is diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpaca α-CoV causes an outbreak of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, no alpaca α-CoV has been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca acquiring HCoV-229E-related α-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipa and Hendra.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, although bat α-CoV acts as a gene bank for HCoV-229E, alpaca and llama may be intermediate hosts for transmitting the virus to humans, exactly the same as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good illustration of interspecific transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the bat's MERS-CoV has been known since its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries have reinforced this argument.
Obviously, bats provide a rich library of virus species for the interspecific exchange and interspecific transmission of gene fragments.
Long-lived and dense groups, close social interaction and strong flight ability are all favorable conditions for bats to become ideal "virus carriers".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the body of a single camel for decades.
It has adapted well to these camels, and the camel has changed from an intermediate host to a stable natural storage host.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and because it cannot continue to spread, humans are still the terminal hosts of MERS-CoV.
Compared with the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolin in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin β-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolin.
They may be the terminal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV, similar to the fruit beaver in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities for the interspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be identified or ruled out.
First, bats may be the storage hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share ecological niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolin may be one of the intermediate expanded hosts of the new invasion of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating game.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
It is necessary to conduct antibody surveys on livestock and wildlife.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may be recombined and adapted in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolin.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus also play an important role in promoting the coronavirus to cross the interspecific barrier.
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared with other single-stranded RNA viruses, the mutation rate of coronavirus is estimated to be "medium" to "high". According to the adaptation stage of coronavirus to new hosts, the average replacement rate of each site 2 is about 10-4 times a year.
Coronaviruses have proofreading-active ribonucleic acid exonuclease, and removing them can lead to very high variability and attenuation, or even inability to survive.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting this ribonucleic acid exonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Redsive is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of coronavirus is about 1 million times higher than that of its host.
In addition, if the coronavirus does not adapt well to the host, its mutation rate is usually high.
Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower, indicating that it is more adaptable to humans.
It can be speculated that it has adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-hump camels.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause the rapid failure of vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the larger RNA genome in coronaviruses has additional plasticity in the modification of gene mutation and recombination, thus increasing the possibility of interspecies collaborative evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are right.
A large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions that encode towards the 3' end of the genome provide evidence for this.
Thirdly, coronaviruses switch templates randomly and frequently through a unique "replication selection" mechanism in the process of RNA replication.
In the host as a mixed container, chain exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs can be recombined to produce new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interactions associated with transmission
In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction between the virus and the host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecific transmission.
Taking the reorganization of SARS-CoV as a typical example, this paper shows the evidence of positive selection in interspecific transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the isolated strains of SARS-CoV between humans and fruit beavers, the researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through mutations in the S protein RBD.
Usually, the RBD in the coronavirus S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is closely screened by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318th to 510th amino acids of the S1 fragment. It binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors to allow the virus to enter.
The RBD of SARS-CoV can recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, fruit beavers, mice and beaver cats, thus allowing the virus to spread between species.
In fact, only six amino acid residues different from the isolated strains of human and fruit beaver virus were observed in the RBD, of which four residues were located in the receptor binding sequence interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
There are K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of the fruit beaver SARS-CoV, which may increase the affinity of fibrous protein interacting with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S protein S1 unit is 30%, which means that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a frozen electron microscopy study showed that the affinity of this binding is 10 to 20 times higher than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but to different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptidase N of HCoV-229E and the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid of HCoV-OC43.
They may also explain why the above-mentioned coronavirus has successfully adapted to humans after cross-species transmission from animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of HCoV interspecific transmission are also influenced by other host-dependent and restrictive factors.
The differences in these host proteins between humans and HCoV natural hosts such as bats, llamas and rodents may constitute an obstacle to interspecific transmission.
In order to successfully achieve interspecific transmission, HCoV must deprive the host dependence factor and break the host restriction factor.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in the important field of virus-host interaction have yet to be determined and characterized.
Using the latest CRISPR technology, an impartial genome-wide screening of the host dependence and restrictive factors of SARS-CoV-2 may yield results.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to where it was
The diversity of bat coronavirus provides ample opportunity for the emergence of a new type of HCoV.
In this sense, the bat coronavirus acts as a gene bank for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene recombination are also drivers of HCoV evolution and two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes may radically change the phenotype of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV auxiliary protein, due to the isolation of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, it was found that they could encode different ORF8 proteins, so ORF8 was considered important for adapting to humans.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide deletion features of SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains of the virus.
This deficiency divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have recombined with the α-and gamma-CoV lines, with a large number of smaller recombinant regions found in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombinant sites have also been found in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the popularity of MERS-CoV has experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in the single-hump camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoV and other animal coronaviruses recombine in their unstructured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may lead to unexpected changes in the viral genome, which is likely due to reducing the selection pressure exerted by the host immune system faced by the virus.
An example of these effects is that in the HCoV-229E prototype virus strain, the absence of dinucleotides leads to the absence of full-length ORF4.
Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca α-CoV shows a single nucleotide insertion, causing a code-shifting mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the pressure of storage host selection.
After bats were infected with the coronavirus, asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected, indicating that the coronavirus and bats adapted to each other.
From an anatomical and physiological point of view, bats seem to have adapted well to the coronavirus.
For example, the defects in the activation of bat inflammatory response effectively reduce the pathological changes caused by coronavirus.
In addition, due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules in the main histocompatibility complex, the natural killer cell activity of bats is inhibited.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen (ROS) produced by the high metabolic activity of bats can not only inhibit coronavirus replication, but also affect proofreading through ribonucleic acid excision enzymes, thus providing selection pressure for the virus strain to produce high pathogenicity when it enters a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is no accident that three new types of HCoV have emerged in the past two decades.
The coronavirus does not cause disease or mild symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate in large numbers and do not cause a strong host immune response.
This is why there are asymptomatic carriers and cases of serious human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to the over-activation of the immune response and cytokine storms, so the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung injury will be.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of delinking the immune response may play a positive role in anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, there are defects in the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory body in bats.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammatory body may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is based.
Although bat β-CoV has been found to be 95% nucleotide homologous with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that is up to 96% nucleotide homologous with SARS-CoV-2.
Although beavers and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified.
At present, pangolin β-CoV, which is clearly homologous with SARS-CoV-2, has been found, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts, or that pangolin β-CoV may have contributed genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus has once again become the focus of attention.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the origin of HCoV human-animal co-morbidity and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
There is ample evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection originated from the contact between humans and fruit beavers on the market, closing the wet goods market and killing fruit beavers can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Similarly, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin β-CoV closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolin should be removed from the wet goods market in order to prevent the spread of human-animal diseases.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolin and other mammals remains to be further studied.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in single-hump camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for local people.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to follow the example of the Chinese wildlife market in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
In order to stop the re-outbreak of MERS, comprehensive measures should be taken in conjunction with other infection control measures to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camels.
As we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge, leading to an outbreak of the epidemic.
Various human and animal co-morbid coronaviruses circulate in the wild.
In particular, there is a high diversity of bat coronaviruses with the potential for human-animal co-morbidity.
These human-animal co-morbid coronaviruses have many opportunities for evolution and recombination, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more likely to spread and/or be fatal in humans in the future.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should formulate better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural hosts until there is a chance of spillover.
Although bats have many characteristics conducive to the spread of the virus, if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wild species, human exposure to bats and other wild species will be greatly reduced.
In order to better understand the ecological status of coronavirus and its natural hosts, it is necessary to continuously monitor mammals, which will prove to be very useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
In short, the most effective way to prevent viral human-animal co-morbidity is that humans should stay away from the ecological niche of the natural host of human-animal co-morbidity virus.
There are still several shortcomings in the mystery of the origin of human-animal co-morbidity in SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolin, it makes sense to examine the circumstances under which bats and pangolin can share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans come into contact with bats remains to be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolin.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be carried out.
In the case of bats, pangolin or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent virus will be found in natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this field will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
