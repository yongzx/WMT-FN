the b'COVID-19 app is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 Coronavirus outbreak, helping to track close contacts and identify individuals who may have been in contact with an infected person (”contacts").
Some regions and jurisdictions have developed or presented many applications with the support of official governments.
Many frameworks for building close contact tracking applications have been established.
Privacy issues have also attracted much attention,especially when some systems need to track the geographical location of application users.
Less invasive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the distance between the user and other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that the Bluetooth-enabled application will be directly integrated into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check for exposure to COVID-19 patients on their own.
The program is currently used in more than 200 cities in China.Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source software, and will be handed over to the government.Northern Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app " StopKorona!It is used to track the exposure of potentially infected people and help medical institutions respond quickly.
The app was developed by the Ministry of communications technology of Northern Macedonia and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the close contact tracking application had entered an advanced stage of development and would be operational in the coming weeks.Ireland and France also plan to launch similar applications ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia plans to launch a geofence application for COVID-19 confirmed patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of safety engineering at the University of Cambridge, cited some practical issues that could exist with the application system, including false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if only a small percentage of the population uses the application.
To prevent the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple has set a limit on the types of organizations that can publish coronavirus-related applications in the Apple App Store, that is, only“official”or other reputable organizations.
Both Google and Amazon impose similar restrictions.
Privacy activists say they are concerned about the use of coronavirus applications for large-scale surveillance, especially if surveillance infrastructure built to respond to the Coronavirus outbreak should be dismantled after the threat has been eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations have announced eight conditions to be met for government projects：
Surveillance must be " lawful, necessary and proportionate”；
Monitoring and surveillance extensions must have a“sunset " clause；
The data collected is for COVID-19 purposes only；
Data security and anonymity must be protected and there is evidence that they are protected；
Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization；
Any data sharing with third parties shall be defined by law；
Safeguards must be provided to prevent data abuse and to provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse；
Requiring the“meaningful participation”of all“relevant stakeholders”, including public health experts and marginalized groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and reporters ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also published the checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of continuous monitoring, which will be removed from the device's operating system once tracking is no longer needed.
Some countries have adopted web-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need for users to download applications and avoiding being tracked.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to raw location data can have serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data;many privacy protection systems that only use central servers to communicate with each other have been created (see below).
South Korea introduced a non-application-based system to perform contact tracking tasks.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system chose to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine that information to send notifications to potential infected people via text messages.
In addition to using the information to alert potential close contacts, the government has been allowed to disclose location information as a result of major changes in the country's information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites.Other countries, including Germany, are considering both centralized systems and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, specific details have not been released.
Close contact tracing is a recognized concept,and a large number of relevant research literature dates back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy protection solutions,such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (ble) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordinated scheme that includes a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single protocol.Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, formerly known as contact event number, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and mobile contact tracking mechanism (PACT).
Under these agreements, personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all matches are made on the device.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Lab has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or path crossing data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the research content of the white paper "application rogue: protecting personal privacy in an outbreak", released in March 2020.In addition to this, Enigma MPC, a company that was originally founded in the MIT Media Lab and dedicated to developing privacy technology, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace leverages secure hardware technology to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, a group of groups formed the global TCN alliance around essentially the same approach and essentially overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation of information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key to achieving widespread application.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that its official government application uses the Open Source BlueTrace protocol.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a close contact tracking plan, claiming that the plan will combine Bluetooth Low Energy Technology and privacy encryption technology, can play a role in protecting privacy.
In addition, they published the core technical specifications used in the system.
Apple and Google said the system is planned to be launched in three stages：
Launch of tools to support the government in creating an official coronavirus tracking app that protects privacy
This feature is directly integrated into iOS and Android systems, Google and Apple plans to first launch the system through the operating system update, after the outbreak threat will also be removed by the same way, in order to solve the problem of follow-up monitoring.
Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is the act of cleaning the hands in order to remove dust, grease, microbes or other unwanted substances.
Persisting in hand washing with soap at certain“critical moments”of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be spread through the faecal–oral route.
If people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or the common cold.
Five key moments of the day when you must wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after cleaning your child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding your child, before meals, before and after handling food or before and after handling raw, fish or poultry.
If there is no soap and water, you can clean your hands with ash.Who recommends washing hands in the following cases：
Prepare food before, during and after.
Take care of patients before and after.
After changing diapers or cleaning the hips of a toilet child.
After rubbing snot, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal,animal food or animal feces.
Hand hygiene of medical personnel refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before dispensing medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove the hands may harm the human body or cause disease pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease)and chemical substances.
Hand washing is especially important for people working in food processing or in the medical field, but it is also very important for the public.
The health benefits of hand washing include minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea;and reducing respiratory infections；
And to reduce infant mortality at home delivery.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing habits had a slight effect on height increases in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by advocating simple behavioural changes (for example, hand washing with soap).
This simple behavior can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by nearly 50%.
Advocating hand-washing interventions can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about one-third, equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap can reduce diarrhoea by 48%.As a spontaneous behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world, handwashing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute Respiratory infections (Acute Respiratory Infections, ARI).。肥皂 肥皂 肥皂 肥皂 肥皂 肥皂 肥皂 肥皂 肥皂 。的 肥皂 肥皂，肥皂 肥皂 肥皂 肥皂 。 。 。 。 。的 肥皂 。 。 。 。 。 
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, which kills about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Making handwashing with soap before meals and after going to the toilet into an ingrained habit saves more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, UNICEF says, reducing deaths from diarrhoea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
As part of the water, sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, hand washing is often accompanied by other health interventions.
Hand washing can also prevent impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
Hand washing can bring a slight adverse effect, that is, frequent hand washing can lead to dry skin, causing skin damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, chapped skin, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Excessive frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
To reduce the fecal-oral spread of the disease, be sure to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day: after going to the toilet(urination,defecation), after cleaning your child's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding your child, before meals, before and after handling food or after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
To prevent the spread of the disease, proper hand washing should also be used in the following cases: before and after treatment of an incision or wound; after sneezing, coughing or wiping the nose; after touching animal feces or treating animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the proportion of handwashing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households used soap to wash their hands.A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest share, at 97 per cent; the United States was close to the average, at 77 per cent; and China had the lowest share, at 23 per cent.A number of behavioural changes have been implemented to promote hand-washing with soap at critical times.In order for children to develop hand-washing habits, developing countries may choose to have children in school wash their hands in groups on a daily basis.
The basic health care programme launched by the Philippine Ministry of education is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.
At the heart of this national programme is deworming twice a year, supplemented by Daily hand washing with soap and brushing with fluoride toothpaste.
In Indonesia, the plan has also been successfully implemented.
The inclusion of soap or detergent in the water better removes microbes from the skin.
The main role of soaps and detergents is to reduce the dissolution barrier and improve solubility.
Water alone can not effectively clean the skin, because fats and proteins (components of organic soil) do not dissolve easily in water.
However, cleaning and hand washing requires proper use of water……
Solid soap can be reused and may retain bacteria left behind during previous use.
A small number of studies investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap and concluded that the bacteria could not be transferred because the bacteria would be washed off by the foam.
However, the CDC still claims that " it is best to use non-contact liquid soap."
Antibacterial soap has been vigorously promoted in the health-conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant microbes in nature have been chosen with the recommended antimicrobial or disinfectant.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antimicrobial agents such as triclosan, triclosan has a large number of resistant microbial strains.
Therefore, if not for antibiotic-resistant strains and choose antimicrobial soap, antimicrobial soap may not be so effective propaganda.
In addition to surfactants and skin care agents, complex formulations may also contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH adjusting agents, antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and more skin conditioning agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that ordinary soaps had the same effect as consumer-grade antimicrobial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from hands.
Hot water is comfortable to wash your hands, but its heat is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria breed quickly at Body Temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water has no effect on the reduction of microorganisms on the hands, contrary to popular belief.
Water-free hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a non-water-based hand cleanser.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, non-water-based alcohol hand cleansers (also known as alcohol hand wash, no-wash sterilization hand wash or no-wash hand wash) became popular.
Most of these hand sanitizers are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is then added to thickeners such as carbomer (acrylic polymer) to form a gel, or added to humectants such as glycerol to form a liquid, or foamy for ease of Use and to relieve dry skin caused by alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide can further increase the antimicrobial activity.No-wash hand sanitizer containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol can be effective sterilization.
Alcohol hand rub can kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
A 70% alcohol hand rub can kill 99.97% of bacteria (3.5 orders of magnitude less, similar to a 35 dB reduction) after 30 seconds and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude) of bacteria after 1 minute.Leave-in hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria,while for some viruses it is slightly less effective.
Alcohol hand rub liquid norovirus (norovirus, also known as Novalk, Norwalk) like the virus(the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis) almost completely ineffective.You must use enough disposable hand sanitizer or alcohol hand rub to thoroughly moisten or cover your hands.
The palms and back of the hand and between the fingers and all fingers end scrub for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The fingertips must also be thoroughly cleaned, rubbing the fingertips on both palms.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands instead of using a hands-free scrub, especially when your hands look dirty.
Because such hand rub liquid easy to use and quickly deactivate microorganisms, so increasingly used; however, they should not replace the proper hand washing, unless there is no soap and water available.
Frequent use of alcohol-free hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formulation.
Glycerin and/or other emollients may be added to the formulation to reduce or eliminate dry skin caused by alcohol.
In clinical trials, alcohol-free hand sanitizers containing emollients significantly reduce skin irritation and dryness compared to soaps or antibacterial cleaners.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or allergies to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rub are rare.
One reason for its attractiveness is that alcohol-free hand sanitizers are less likely to induce irritating contact dermatitis than they are to wash their hands with soap and water.
Anhydrous cleaning agent, although effective, but does not remove the organic matter on the hands, just disinfect it.
Therefore, no-wash hand sanitizer in preventing the spread of many pathogens is not as effective as soap and water, because these pathogens are still in the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizer largely depends on the composition and formulation, the effect has always been much worse than alcohol and alcohol hand rub liquid.
Recently, the use of benzalkonium chloride formulations have been shown to have a sustained, cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, which is different from alcohol, alcohol has been shown to reduce the effect after repeated use, may be due to gradually cause adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can replace it with ash or soil.
Ash or soil is better than washing hands with water alone,but not as good as soap.
One of the problems is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microbes, it may accelerate the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when exposed to water.
WHO recommends that if no soap is available, you can replace soap with ash or sand.
The steps recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for proper hand washing to prevent disease transmission are as follows：
Wet hands with flowing warm or cool water.
Running water is recommended because vertical pots may be contaminated, and the water temperature seems to have little to do with it.
Wash the back of your hands, fingers, and nails with a sufficient amount of soap.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin,and studies have shown that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of washing their hands with water alone.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrub can create friction, which helps remove bacteria on the skin, the longer the scrub, the more bacteria removed.
Wash thoroughly with running water.
Washing hands with a basin can cause re-contamination.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry naturally.
Wet hands are more likely to be re-contaminated.Thumb, wrist, finger area and nail seam are the most often overlooked areas.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may hide microbes.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizer to avoid dry hands;dry skin can cause damage to the skin, which increases the risk of infection spreading.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available in developing countries, a variety of low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing,such as pouring water through a hanging bucket or perforated gourd, and / or using ash to wash hands(if necessary).In situations where water supplies are limited (for example, in schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-efficient hand-washing programmes, such as simple taps and other low-cost means, can be used.
The technique of a simple tap is simple: hang a water tank with a rope, then pour a small amount of water into your hand through a foot pedal, and then use soap.
Dry hands effectively is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way to dry hands in public toilets.
More and more research has shown that paper towels are more hygienic than electric hand dryers provided in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study sponsored by the European tissue Symposium of the tissue industry, comparing sanitary degrees of tissue, warm air dryers and more modern jet dryers.
After washing hands using a warm air dryer drying hands, found that the total amount of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194%, the total amount of bacteria on the palm of the average increase of 254%.
In order to spray dry phone dry hand, the total amount of bacteria on the finger increased by an average of 42%, the total amount of bacteria on the palm increased by an average of 15%.
After washing hands with a paper towel to dry the hand, the total amount of bacteria on the finger reduced by an average of 76%, the total amount of bacteria on the palm of the average reduction of 77%.Scientists have also conducted tests to determine whether various dry hand methods may cause cross-infection among other toilet users and toilet facilities.
Jet dryers are said to spray air at 180 M/S (650 km/h; 400 mph), capable of blowing away microbes on hands and bodies, potentially contaminating other toilet users and toilet facilities within two metres.
The use of a warm air dryer can spread microorganisms to 0.25 meters outside the dryer.
The results of dry hands using paper towels indicate that there is no serious microbial spread.In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate different dry hand patterns.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after dry hands：
The study involved many different manufacturers of hand dryers and compared them to hand dryers with paper towels.
During the trip, in the absence of soap and water, you can choose to wash your hands with hand sanitizing wipes.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizers should have an alcohol content of at least 60%.
In 1846, the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis found that hand washing was effective in preventing the spread of disease in hospitals.
Hospitals use electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found a decrease in infection rates after using these devices.
Wash your hands for at least 15 seconds with sufficient soap and water or gel to create foam and scrub all parts of your hands.
Hands fingers buckle each other rub.
If there is residue between the nail seams, it can be removed with a hard brush.
Since the moisture left on the hands may still contain bacteria, it must be thoroughly washed and dried with a clean towel.
After drying, the tap should be closed with a paper towel (if necessary, use a paper towel to open the exit door).
This prevents contact with these surfaces and contamination of the hand again.
In medical and health institutions, hand washing is aimed at eliminating pathogenic microorganisms (”bacteria") and avoiding transmission.
Reports in the New England Journal of Medicine Show that in most medical settings, there are still not reached acceptable levels of hand washing, a large number of health care workers in contact with patients often forget to wash their hands, leading to microbial transmission.
A study shows that proper hand washing, combined with other simple procedures, can reduce catheter-related blood flow infection by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a worksheet demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing methods in medical institutions.
The organization also published a draft manual on hand hygiene on its website for public comment.
Whitby et al. reviewed.
If regulatory compliance needs to be confirmed, then commercial equipment can be measured and validated against household hygiene.
Who recommends“five moments of hand washing”：
After contact with blood / body fluids
Before performing aseptic operations and
After taking care of the patient.Adding antimicrobial chemicals to the soap ("medicated soap" or "antimicrobial soap") can cause the hand-washing agent to produce a bactericidal effect.
Before performing surgery or a large number of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms environment, you may need this sterilization operation.When“scrubbing”hands for surgery, there must be a faucet that can be opened and closed without contact, hand sanitizer containing chlorhexidine or iodine, a sterile towel to dry your hands after washing, a sterile brush for scrubbing and other sterile tools for cleaning nails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands, forearms and elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
Do not need a long Scrub(10 minutes).
When rinsing, water from the forearm must be prevented from returning to the hand.
After washing your hands, dry them with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical gown.
In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, before and after contact with the patient, it is best to wash your hands or use disposable sterilization hand sanitizer.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from cleaning the hands of hand washing frequency reaches 20%, when the frequency of cleaning the hands increased to more than 35%, further benefit is extremely limited.
Compared with the use of antimicrobial soap, washing hands with ordinary soap can lead to more than three times the proportion of bacterial infections that spread to food.After comparing the use of alcohol and antimicrobial soap to wash hands (30 seconds, respectively), it was found that the proportion of bacterial infections using alcohol was 26% lower than that of antimicrobial soap.
However, to reduce the Hand A H1N1 influenza(HI1N1 influenza A)virus and Clostridium difficult spores(Clostridium difficult spores), soap and water than alcohol hand rub liquid more effective.Hand hygiene in health facilities can be improved through interventions such as training staff on how to wash their hands, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rub fluids, and providing written and oral reminders to staff.
Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in a variety of medical settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an important cost-effective tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes universal hand-washing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there are inexpensive ways to build sinks, it is rare to have a hand-washing tap near every private bathroom or toilet.
However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be the result of ingrained habits, not a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating the use of soap for hand-washing can influence policymaking, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term behavioural changes in the population.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing hand-washing rates in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), while social marketing campaigns were less effective.An example of advocating hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's Samsung approach, which, among other hygiene requirements, encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can rise from one star to the highest of three stars.
Hand-washing campaigns could include the construction of wash basins to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of a hands-washing awareness campaign is world Hand-Washing Day, an attempt to achieve behavioural change.Since the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the use of a hand-washing emoji.
Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing and the adjusted life-years to avoid disability (DALY) in developing countries.
However, there have been reports that advocating for hand-washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The first to recognize the importance of hand washing for human health-especially for those who are physically weak(for example, mothers who have just given birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers) - were two pioneers in hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British“founder of modern nursing”.
At that time, most people still thought the infection was caused by a stench called miasma.
1980s foodborne disease outbreaks and iatrogenic infections, prompting the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively advocate hand health, emphasizing hand health is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters of“how to wash your hands properly”are hung next to wash basins in public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets.
To take care of something, to take care of it, to take care of it, to take care of it, to take care of it, to take care of it, to take care of it, to take care of it.
It is derived from the biblical gospel of Matthew, which Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus and later evolved into a widely used idiom in some English-speaking communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth began to forcibly wash her hands in an attempt to purge imaginary stains, showing her guilt for her crimes and for encouraging her husband to commit them.
Studies have shown that people who think or conceive of unethical behavior tend to wash their hands more frequently than others and tend to value hand-washing facilities more.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after contemplating unethical behavior are less likely to engage in other”purifying " compensatory actions,such as volunteering.
Religion calls for hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes.Symbolic hand-washing with water but without soap is part of many religious icons, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, hand-washing in Christianity and wudoo ' in Islam.Religion also includes provisions for hand washing in the area of hygiene, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
The 2019 covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths and a huge human catastrophe.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people in 2003,SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
Although the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is lower than SARS, but its transmission is stronger, the elderly affected more than young, more men than women.
In view of the rapid increase in New-Crown pneumonia related publications, this paper intends to make a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly developing research topic.
We will introduce basic knowledge about the epidemiology, etiology, Virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and Prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, We hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 is an unprecedented and memorable memory for Chinese people, and the outbreak of a new type of viral disease forces everyone to stay at home throughout the holidays and for weeks to come.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and The Associated disease is called covid-19.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country,then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases,of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 have died.
Who warns COVID-19 has become "Public Enemy Number One" and its threat may outweigh terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months, covering Virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment.
This paper aims to summarize the research progress in this emerging subject area.
It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-induced disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far on the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some pressing issues that remain to be addressed.
The past has been that CoV is a human non-lethal pathogens, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold in 4.
But this century has encountered two highly pathogenic human Covs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which erupted in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries, with horrific morbidity and mortality.
Thus, the COVID-19 outbreak is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, the city of Wuhan first reported a number of unexplained cases of pneumonia to the National Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
At the same time, the outbreak spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, health care workers were reported infected, suggesting that there may be a human-to-human phenomenon.
On January 23, Wuhan closed its city and closed all public transport.
Only 21 out of 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the South China seafood market in Wuhan, which is believed to be the starting point for infections of unknown animal origin, in the first clinical study of new-Crown pneumonia on January 24.
On January 30, WHO announced the outbreak as a " global health emergency."
At the time of this report, the disease has spread to China and nearly 50 other countries around the World(Figure 2 (Fig.2)).
Due to the rapid development of the outbreak, the final scope and severity of the outbreak have yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided an updated description of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages, but the main age group is 30-65 years old.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) of infected persons are over 50 years of age, a very small number are under 20 years of age and only 14 infected persons are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 mainly concentrated in Hubei and the surrounding area of sexual transmission.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic regeneration number (R0) of 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), R0 adjusted for 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the large-scale population movement ahead of the Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large envelope virus subfamily containing single-sense strand RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely α, β, γ and δ, where α-CoV and β-CoV are known to infect humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV envelope stinging glycoprotein (S) in combination with its cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and then membrane fusion occurs.
Viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; viral genome replication, genomic RNA and envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins together form vesicles containing virions, and then fusion with the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-CoV, with genetic consistency exceeding 99.98% of the 10 sequenced samples collected from the South China seafood market in Wuhan, where the original outbreak occurred.
Compared to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar in gene terms to SARS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra-thin sections of the human tract epithelium.
The study found that human ACE2 is SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV receptors.
However, with respect to the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 s protein and human ACE2 binding force is weak, which results in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection severity is lower than the fact that SARS-CoV coincide.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be formed by orf3b encoded by the novel short proteins and secreted proteins encoded by orf8.
ORF3B of SARS-CoV - 2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of Ifnß; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
February 18, 2020, Zhou et al reported the formation of amino acid transporter protein B0AT1 complex full-length human ACE2 frozen electron microscope (cryo-EM) structure, a resolution of 2.9 Å.
They found that the complex has an open and closed conformation, assembled into a dimer, ACE2 - b0at1 complex can bind to two S proteins, thereby providing CoV recognition and evidence of infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through Beavers and camels, respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV, bats are considered a natural host of SARS-CoV-2, because the new virus and two SARS-like CoV from bat-called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21-have 96% consistency.
However, it is not clear what intermediate hosts help the virus to infect humans across the species barrier, and its transmission path remains to be clarified.
Ji et al proposed snake from bat to human carriers of the virus, which involves homologous recombination inside the S protein.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe pangolin is a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, given the 99% genetic homology of a CoV found in pangolin, a long-snout anteater often used in Chinese medicine, according to a study.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a huge difference;therefore, specific evidence remains to provide a decisive result(fig.33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment, up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40% -50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
According to reports, SARS-CoV-2 UV and heat-sensitive-56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents can effectively inactivate the virus,but chlorine has been set can not effectively inactivate the virus.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2 reported.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other Covs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV(fig.4).4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, the host's inherent immune system will first be identified by pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), nod-like receptor (NLR) and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Viruses induce inflammatory factor expression through different pathways, dendritic cell maturation and Type I interferon (IFN) synthesis, they will limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the virus antigen macrophage phagocytosis.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus get rid of the immune response.
The adaptive immune response will soon join the fight against the virus.
Including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, including T lymphocytes play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4 + T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8 + T cells directly kill infected cells.
Adjuvant T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help said defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, including complement-such as C3a and C5a-and antibodies, is also critical to resist viral infections.
For example, an antibody isolated from a rehabilitated patient can neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overreaction of the immune system will produce large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, in the worst case, can lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, characterized by clustered morbidity, are more likely to affect older people with multiple comorbidities, as well as pregnant women.
Typically, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impaired immune function are more likely to become infected than others.
According to a study of the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective isolation time to the most accurate incubation period, which prevents asymptomatic infections from spreading the virus to others.
As a rule, a virus contact or infected person usually requires 14 days of isolation.
Should the isolation time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and first symptom of COVID-19, can be without any other symptoms, can also be accompanied by dry cough,shortness of breath, myalgia, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting and other symptoms.
Some patients have difficulty breathing and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset.
Severe cases will quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome,septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction.
Even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for viruses for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55%, diarrhoea 3%; 8% of patients need ventilation support.
Two recent studies on the incidence of family aggregation and asymptomatic transmission of individuals leading to the incidence of aggregation reported similar results.
In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that fever (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and dyspnea (55 per cent) were also the main symptoms in MERS-CoV patients.
However, 80% of these patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients, and MERS mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 coincide.
In MERS patients also observed diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
In patients with SARS, it has been shown that fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dyspnea (40% -42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) as the main symptoms, about 14% -20% of patients need ventilation support.。SAR SAR SAR SAR SAR SAR SAR SAR SAR SAR 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 
As of February 14, 66,576 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed worldwide,with a mortality rate of 2%.
In contrast, the SARS mortality rate was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the death rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An early study reported R0 of SARS-CoV-2 as high as 6.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data show that the diffusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Agglomeration usually occurs in the same family, or from the same party or transport, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease, or have a history of close contact with the infected person or patient.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and discharged cured patients can carry the virus again, thereby issuing an alarm to extend the isolation time.
The number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood in patients with early onset is normal or decreased.
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients found leukocyte count & lt;4 × 109 / L-including lymphocyte count & lt; 1×109/L-lymphopenia, elevated levels of aspartic aminotransferase and viremia.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were observed in the blood,while in most patients, elevated levels of blood C-reactive protein and ESR were observed.
Patients with heavy blood fibrin degradation products seen increased D-dimer levels and progressive reduction in lymphocyte count.
Most COVID-19 patients showed abnormal chest imaging, characterized by bilateral patch-like shadow or lung grinding glass shadow.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia,acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis can seriously damage the gas exchange.
Type I and Type II alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability to expand the lungs and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest imaging findings usually occur at the same time as the most severe of the disease.
February 18, 2020, COVID-19 first pathological analysis found alveolar epithelial cell shedding, transparent membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and multicore syncytial somatic cells in the lungs of a patient died of the disease, consistent with viral infections and pathological manifestations of ARDS, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, since a higher false negative rate could accelerate the epidemic, China began using clinical manifestations for diagnosis on February 13, 2020(instead of relying solely on RT-PCR).
A similar situation occurs when SARS is diagnosed.
Therefore, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and imaging results is essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported a solution to detect SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at concentrations of 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies of the virus per microliter) in less than an hour using a single Strip without complex instruments.
If validated in clinical samples, then this new technology is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.
Due to the lack of experience in the treatment of new CoV, doctors mainly COVID-19 patients to provide support for treatment, while trying to have been used or proposed for other CoV-such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-and other viral diseases of various therapies (table (Table2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments,such as antivirals, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma, herbs and psychological support in rehabilitated patients.
It is even recommended that the plasma of patients who have been rehabilitated for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning, and may also attack other organs expressing ACE2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the main threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives,including conventional oxygen, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, to maintain electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock and protect vital organ function for SARS-CoV-2 patients is also essential.
It is well known that overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS can lead to cytokine storms.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFa, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA,Ifnß,IFNy and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe illness.
Corticosteroids and tolzumab-an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody-have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive therapies against cytokine storm include: regulating T cell directed immune response; blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; bona spit monoclonal antibody; cytokine signal transduction inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immunosuppressants are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, large doses of steroids for SARS and COVID-19 patients with severe lung injury is not useful.
On the contrary, they may cause serious side effects, especially ischemic osteonecrosis, which seriously affect the prognosis.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that patients with critical COVID-19 be treated with caution with a short course of treatment with a medium and low dose of corticosteroids.
At the time of writing, the existence of effective antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, it has been found that redcivir-a nucleotide analogs-intravenous administration of a COVID-19 patients in the United States effective.
Redcivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, it was also proved that redcivir may inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gilead has supplied the drug to China for two clinical trials of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, with promising results.
In addition, it has been recommended to use barricotinib, α-interferon, lopinavir / ritonavir and ribavirin as a potential therapy in patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by the patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody production in recovered patients
Patients recovering from infectious diseases collect blood for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection of the disease has a long history.。血液 血液 血液 血液 血液 血液 血液 血液 血液 。的 血液 血液 血液 血液 。 。 。 。 。 。 。的 血液 血液 。 。 。 
In fact, patients who have recovered in their blood usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (IG) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, which can identify unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this principle, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of convalescent COVID-19 patients and then injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, while inflammation and viral load were found to decrease,and blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, before the development of specific therapies, it is necessary to verify and clarify to propose a method that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a toxic response that can be life-threatening.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low, and plasma is in high demand for the treatment of critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, a more critical and practical approach is: isolated from patients who have recovered B cells and identify the genetic code encoding an effective antibody, or screening effective antibodies against viral proteins essential.
In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
In China, the use of TCM to treat a variety of diseases has been thousands of years of history.
However, its therapeutic effect depends largely on the combination of multiple ingredients in the prescription, and the prescription varies according to the diagnosis of the disease TCM theory.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear, because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, so TCM has become one of the main alternative treatment methods in patients with mild to moderate symptoms or have recovered from the severe phase of the patient.
For example, it has been found Shu Feng detoxification capsules and capsules even Huaqing blast COVID-19 effective treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87% of patients using TCM treatment, which was observed in COVID-19 patients with the highest cure rate, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province only in about 30% of COVID-19 patients using TCM treatment, the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other influencing factors should also be included in the assessment, such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Bo Li Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) therapy alone with WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the WM + TCM Group body temperature recovery, symptoms and hospitalization time required significantly shorter than the WM group alone.
Most impressive, the WM+TCM Group had a significantly lower rate of symptom progression (light to heavy) than the WM group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the WM+TCM Group had a similarly lower rate of mortality than the WM group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still require higher quality controlled trials, a greater range and more centers to confirm.
Characterize the mechanism of action of TCM therapy or a combination thereof and, where possible, clarify its active ingredient will also be of concern.
Patients who are suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 will experience great fear from this highly contagious and even fatal disease,and those who are isolated will feel depressed, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough,as well as adverse treatment reactions, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of SARS reported a series of psychological reactions, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracing and isolation can increase anxiety and guilt about the effects of infection, isolation, and stigma on their families and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team to communicate clearly by regularly and accurately updating SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak information and treatment plans, using specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential for disrupting the chain of transmission from animal hosts and infected patients to susceptible hosts, and are often used as a complementary means of antiviral therapy in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has worked to develop vaccines based on S protein to produce long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and / or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models of SARS.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, these candidate vaccines have not been determined in vivo effectiveness and its protective effect on zoonotic viral infections in the elderly and lethal attack models.
This is most likely because SARS has disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic and clustered cases of MERS persist in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in affected areas.
By using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current outbreak.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time required for Vaccine Development (an average of 18 months) and the dynamics of the CoV.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 severe patients also have a high prevalence and mortality.
Therefore, modelling the prognosis of the disease is critical for health-care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect the prognosis COVID-19 patients or associated with the prognosis (table (Table33）：
Age: Age is the most important factor affecting the prognosis of SARS,as is COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7% of patients were over 50 years of age.
Patients who require intensive care are more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and are significantly older than patients who do not require intensive care(median age is 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor in the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: as previously mentioned, more men than women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000).
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events are also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive bile duct cells, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been seen as a potential prognostic factor for Disease, Treatment Response, and eventual recovery.
It was also suggested that there is a correlation between CRP levels and COVID-19 severity and prognosis.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartic acid aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to predicting outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of dysfunction of the heart or liver.
Main clinical symptoms: temporal progression of chest radiography and clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other questions to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as mentioned earlier, steroids are immunosuppressants, often used as adjuvant therapy for Infectious Diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since large doses of corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffer from ischemic osteonecrosis, leading to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if desired, steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients in small doses and for a short time.
Psychological stress: as mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under extreme stress,as they often suffered long-term isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of relatives and patients.
Psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get rid of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 seem to differ from that of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or asymptomatic in the early stages of infection, which is similar to other CoV causing the common cold.
Therefore, infected people in the early onset or incubation period will produce a large number of viruses in the course of daily activities, to bring great difficulties to control the epidemic.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV is considered to occur in patients with serious illness,most of the spread does not occur in the early stages.
As a result, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe and difficult to control than SARS.
China is making enormous efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and its surrounding cities and the continued isolation of almost all of its population, to interrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have already done serious damage to China's economy and elsewhere, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is slowing.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the downturn will last 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. have developed models to predict the consequences of the outbreak, arguing that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that patients who recovered and were discharged two weeks ago detected SARS-CoV-2 in both the turbinate and the swab, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a flu-like cyclical epidemic.
But as the number of new cases has declined, there are encouraging signs in China that the current strategy may have worked.
Ebola was predicted to cause 1 million cases and 500,000 deaths.
However, with strict isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less contagious and eventually disappear or become less pathogenic viruses coexist with the human body.
The following provides a comparison of COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (fig.55).
SARS-CoV - 2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and possibly even by direct contact with items contaminated with the virus.
The virus is also found in feces, which increases the likelihood of fecal mouth transmission.
In a recent study of 138 cases, 41 per cent of the cases may have been caused by an in-hospital infection, including 17 patients previously suffering from other diseases and 40 health-care workers.
Therefore, more rigorous preventive measures should be taken to protect the population,especially health-care workers,social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have had contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing a mask; both surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent droplets from potentially infected people spread in the air or adhere to the surface of the article may be passed to other people.
However, only the N95 (1860s series) masks can prevent inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm,and only 5% of the virions can penetrate completely;SARS-CoV - 2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, each of which is about 85 nm.
Since viral particles can even penetrate five stacked surgical masks, paramedics in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should also wear isolation clothing to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical staff in the face of the patient should also wear a transparent mask or goggles.
For the public in areas affected by or potentially affected by the outbreak, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands with sterile soap more frequently than usual, try to stay indoors to isolate themselves and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to keep away from the patient.
These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is as a new virus into the human world, but based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak, January 7, 2020 reported its high homology with SARS-CoV should have caused China's high alert.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention is still pacifying the public, said the new virus is not contagious, the possibility of human transmission is limited, and the epidemic can be prevented and controlled.
The news clearly relaxed the public's vigilance,and on the eve of the spring festival, will contain the epidemic in Wuhan key node is thus missed.
China's Disease Control Agencies are likely to learn this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more cautious in issuing announcements, as every word is critical to citizens and can change their attitudes and decision-making; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more rigorous in controlling potential outbreaks at an early stage rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve social response systems.
COVID-19 outbreaks caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, it has spread to China and nearly 50 other countries around the world in less than two months.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, so COVID-19 outbreak looks like a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are critical to controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly people than young people, more men than women,and the severity and mortality of older patients than younger patients.
The mortality rate for SARS was higher than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even without symptoms,and SARS patients usually spread the virus when the disease is serious, which makes it much more difficult to control COVID-19 transmission than SARS.
This partly explains why the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is far more rapid and widespread than that of SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, conventional RNA test results for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, the cured patient may turn Yang again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of virus transmission.
Given the speed with which COVID-19 is being studied,the following key issues remain to be addressed：
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats SARS-like CoV, we still can not conclude that SARS-CoV-2 from bats.
Which animals are the intermediate hosts that transmit the virus from the original host-assuming bats-to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we can not effectively cut off the path of transmission, and the outbreak can relapse at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how precisely does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Will the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the outbreak last?
How do viruses evolve from person to person?
Will it become a global pandemic?Disappear like SARS?Or will it recur regularly like the flu?
Finding answers to the above and many other questions is crucial, but it can take a long time.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been completed clinical trials, but many attempts to develop the vaccine is still ongoing.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said no vaccine against the disease-causing virus, SARS-CoV-2, was expected for 18 months.
In April, five candidate vaccines entered the Phase I Safety study.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
In 2020, a large-scale epidemic spread across the globe, triggering significant investment and research in the development of vaccines.
Many organizations are using the virus genome has been released to develop a possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
In April, CEPI proposed a vaccine development plan and said speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment, and global access were the priorities.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, there are 10 different technology platforms that are researching and developing an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The main platform targets for the Phase I Safety study include：
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273）
Viral vector (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5）
CEPI scientists reported in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 have been announced but with little public information (presumably being planned or designed).
Phase I-II trials carry out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled multi-site trials, while determining a more accurate and effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including the control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine against disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at optimal doses.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not been evaluated in humans (still in“preclinical”research).
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that could genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune responses.
Around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of vaccine development, with the goal of starting human trials by 2021.

Development and production of vaccines.
Both institutions further announced plans to conduct pre-clinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that 11 isolates are being studied,even if accelerated, it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company based in Quebec City, Québec, reported the development of viral-like particles of coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health.
The candidate vaccine is under laboratory study and is scheduled to enter human trials in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had provided CureVac with“‘large sums of money’to get exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine,”which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
MRNA-based candidate vaccine BNT162 is currently in the pre-clinical testing phase and is expected to begin clinical trials in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it will receive pre-clinical test results in April 2020,and that its final candidate vaccine may start human trials in the fall.
On March 19, 2020, in France, the Alliance for innovation in epidemic prevention (CEPI) announced an investment of $ 4.9 million to establish a COVID-19 Vaccine Research Alliance comprising the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine research to $ 29 million.
Other CEPI Investment Partners in COVID-19 vaccine development include Moderna,Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplified RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the virus sequence released in China.
In late March, the government of Canada announced a $ 275 million grant to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19,including numerous vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan university programs.
Around the same time, the government of Canada announced that $ 192 million was earmarked for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and plans to establish a national“vaccine pool”, including several new vaccines, so that they can be put into use in the event of a recurrence of a Coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported a test of PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine that could be used in mice, saying that " the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine provided by MNA allows [mice] to produce a strong antigen-specific antibody response that begins to manifest two weeks after immunization”"
On April 16, 2020, the school of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo, Canada, announced the design of a DNA-based candidate vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the researchers designed DNA to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the United States government, industry and three universities pool resources and combine cloud computing resources from HP, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM supercomputers.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as nonspecific effects.
This means that, in addition to preventing disease, they have other benefits.
Further randomized trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health-care workers.
Vaccines under development may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates, to assess vaccine efficacy suggest the need for biosafety level 3 containment measures for handling live viruses and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no safe and effective for human SARS treatment or prophylactic vaccine.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is a top priority for governments and public health institutions around the world.In addition, there is no effective vaccine against MERS.
When the MERS epidemic, it is believed that the existing SARS research can provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I human clinical trials,and three other vaccines are under development, all of which are viral vectors, two are adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one is MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Various social media articles have fuelled conspiracy theories, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents cited in various social media articles refer to existing patents for gene sequences and vaccines of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus.
Angiotensin - converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 by reducing the content of angiotensin II and increase the Ang (1-7) content to inhibit the Associated angiotensin converting Enzyme (Angiotensin-converting Enzyme, ACE) activity, is expected to become a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronavirus into the cell.
The human-derived version of this enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metallase located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal Peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal Collectrin kidney amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pass Type I Membrane Protein, its enzymatic activity domain is exposed to the cell surface of the lung and other tissues.
Another enzyme is called sheddase (sheddase) of the extracellular domain of ACE2 from the transmembrane domain cleavage, soluble protein produced is released into the blood and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 attached to the cell membrane, mainly lung type II alveolar cells, intestinal epithelial cells of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to counterbalance ACE.
ACE cleavage of angiotensin I having vasoconstrictive activity of angiotensin II.
ACE2 followed by lysis of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) carboxy-terminal amino acid phenylalanine, and hydrolyzed to angiotensin having vasodilating activity (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleavage many other peptides, including de-arginine 9 bradykinin, apelin peptide (apelin), neurodegenerative hormone, strong caffeine A and gastric starvation hormone.
ACE2 can also adjust the neutral amino acid transporter slc6a19 membrane transport, and with Hana's disease (Hartnup) related.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point into the cells of certain coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63;SARS-CoV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 S1 thorn protein on the cell surface ACE2 binding enzyme domain, resulting in endocytosis, so that the virus and enzyme co-translocation to the intracellular nuclei in vivo.
This process also requires entering the host serine protease TMPRSS2 Trigger activation of S protein, inhibition of the process is currently being studied as a potential treatment.Some speculate that lower levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators recommend the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that”the use of ACE inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group".
Moreover,“for patients with a high risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure, the use of ACE inhibitors can also reduce the risk of pneumonia."
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with reduced mortality associated with pneumonia, but the results are not as reliable as reducing the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new approach to the treatment of acute lung injury, appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamic indicators and oxygen saturation in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome piglets.
the Half-Life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, the onset time is 30 minutes,and the course of action (duration) is 24 hours.
Some studies have shown that the classic renin-angiotensin system (renin-angiotensin system, RAS) inhibitors in patients with intolerance or elevated levels of circulating angiotensin II disease, rhACE2 may be a promising drug.the efficacy of rhACE2 infusion for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.
The 2019-2020 Coronavirus outbreak is the continuing spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, January 30, 2020 is listed as a public health emergency of international concern, March 11, 2020 is recognized as an epidemic.
As of April 10, 2020, 210 countries and territories worldwide reported about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases and about 97,000 deaths，
Cure about 36.4 million people.
The fatality rate in China is about 4%, while the global fatality rate ranges from 0.08% (New Zealand) to 13.04% (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
And may be accompanied by pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and other complications.
The incubation period from exposure to the disease is 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Clinical treatment to symptomatic support treatment.Recommended precautions include frequent hand washing,blocking the mouth when coughing,keeping a safe distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspected infected persons.
Official agencies have responded with travel restrictions,isolation, curfews, workplace hazard prevention and control and facility closures.
The global socio-economic impact of the outbreak has been severe, with sports, religious, political and cultural activities postponed or cancelled, and panic shopping exacerbated widespread supply shortages.
Around 99.4 per cent of primary and secondary school and university students are affected by national or local suspension measures in 193 countries and territories worldwide.
As a result of the dissemination of false viral information on the internet, there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other groups of origin and appearance in East and South-East Asia, as well as groups in highly affected areas.
However, reduced travel and heavy industry closures have reduced air pollution and reduced carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, the Health Department of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province), China, reported a number of cases of unexplained pneumonia and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the South China seafood wholesale market, so the new Crown virus is considered zoonotic.
The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely associated with bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV.The earliest cases were confirmed on December 1, 2019, and there was no apparent connection with a number of cases from the South China seafood market.
Two-thirds of the early cases reported in December 2019 were confirmed to be related to the South China seafood market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report, saying that the first case may date back to November 17, 2019, the patient is a 55-year-old male from Hubei province.On February 26, 2020, according to the World Health Organization, China reported a decline in new cases, but Italy, Iran and South Korea reported a sudden surge in new cases, the number of new cases outside China for the first time more than domestic.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially mild cases.
As at 26 February, relatively few adolescent cases had been reported,with only 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide among adolescents aged 19 and under.Patrick Wallace, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimates that about 60% of the UK's population needs to be infected with the new Crown virus in order to obtain effective mass immunization.
Number of cases is the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no more than 3% of the total population in countries around the world were tested, and many countries have issued official policies not to detect people with mild symptoms, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
According to a study published on March 16, an estimated 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections in China had not been tested as at 23 January, and those unrecorded infections were the source of 79 per cent of recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis released on March 30, Italy estimated that the actual number of infections far exceeded the number of reported cases.
COVID-19's basic infection (R0) was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the CDC indicates that R0 may be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients can recover.
The time from onset to death in patients who are unable to recover is 6-41 days, and 14 days is most common.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 people died from COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China were among people over the age of 60,and 75% were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official statistics on COVID-19 deaths usually refer to deaths in patients who have been tested positive for the new Crown virus according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be far greater than the statistics,because the data may not include patients who have not been tested, such as patients who died at home, nursing homes and other places.
Partial data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the outbreak is 4-5 times higher than the official number of deaths due to the new Crown virus pneumonia.
A spokeswoman for the Center for Disease Control (CDC) admitted: "We know that [the number of deaths reported]is lower than the actual number”" and rumors of undervalued US data confirm that statement.Underestimate the frequent occurrence in the field of epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.On January 9, 2020, China's first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan.
On 1 February, the first death outside China occurred in the Philippines and on 14 February, the first death outside Asia occurred in France.
As of February 28, there were more than a dozen deaths outside China, each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths.There are several methods commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by Region, change over time and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the number of tests, the quality of Health Systems, treatment options, when the outbreak first erupted, and age, gender and overall health.Fatality is the result of the number of deaths in a given time period divided by the number of confirmed.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global fatality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The fatality rate is also different in different regions.
In China, the estimated fatality rate declined from 17.3% (for patients who became ill from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for patients who became ill after 1 February 2020).Other measures include case mortality (CFR), which reflects disease deaths as a percentage of confirmed people, and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects disease deaths as a percentage of infected people, both confirmed and undiagnosed.
These statistics are not time-bound and track the entire process from infection to case resolution in a particular population.
Many scholars try to calculate the data for a specific population.
According to the Oxford University evidence-based Medical Center, the overall mortality rate from the outbreak is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is in line with the first randomized test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis study on the impact of the test on the CFR estimate.
The World Health Organization claims the outbreak is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and varies by region.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University notes“ " if left unchecked, outbreaks of infectious diseases usually go into a period of stagnation after the existing host is depleted and then begin to tend to ease.
But at the moment it is almost impossible to reasonably predict when the inflection point will occur.”
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, said that“an end to the outbreak in June could be expected if all countries mobilized to adopt the World Health Organization's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.”
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine, said the SARS-CoV-2“could erupt repeatedly for a year or two."”
A study led by Neil Ferguson at Imperial College suggests that it is important to take physical distance and other measures”before the vaccine is put into use (which can take 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said: "this coronavirus is very contagious, I think it is unlikely to disappear completely”," may evolve into a seasonal disease, erupting once a year."”
The virulence of a recurrence depends on the immunity of the population and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively nonspecific,and some infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (sputum), loss of smell,shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis.According to the World Health Organization, about one in six patients will become serious and have difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classifies dyspnea, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden blurred consciousness, difficulty waking up, and blue face or lips as urgent symptoms; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic and have no clinical signs,but the test results were positive, so researchers recommend close contact with confirmed patients to be closely observed and examined to exclude the possibility of infection.
Estimates for asymptomatic infections in China range from very low to 44%.
The incubation period (the interval from infection to onset) is generally 1-14 days; 5 days is most common.On uncertainty, can be illustrated by an example: COVID-19 patients with olfactory loss of the proportion of patients initially estimated at 30%, and later decreased to 15%.
Some details on the path of transmission of the disease have yet to be determined.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted mainly through close contact and droplets produced when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is within 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) apart.
The study found that an unobstructed cough could cause droplets to spread as far as 4.5 M (15 ft) -8.2 m (15-27 ft).
It has also been suggested that droplets generated when people talk in the air for a long time may also lead to the spread of the virus.Although the virus usually does not spread through the air, but people exhale or talk, can also produce droplets.
This droplet may fall into the mouth and nose of the surrounding people, and even be inhaled into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may atomize respiratory secretions and cause airborne transmission.
In addition, if a person touches a virus-contaminated surface (including skin) and then touches his eyes, nose and mouth, it can also cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of the spread of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset, but before and after the disease is also contagious.
Positive results can be detected as early as three days before the onset, indicating that the new Crown virus before the emergence of obvious symptoms have been contagious.
Although few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases have been reported, some countries have detected asymptomatic infections during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) said that although the transmission power of the new Crown virus is not completely clear, but the average person can infect 2-3 people.The survival time of the virus on the surface varies from several hours to several days.
Specifically, it is known that the new Crown virus can survive up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.There have been positive COVID-19 cases in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals will re-transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities still recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus in nature are associated coronavirus presented.Before the virus does not enter the body, it can be used to kill household soap, because soap can dissolve the protective capsule of the virus.SARS-CoV - 2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Currently it is considered zoonotic.
Genetic analysis showed that this coronavirus is genetically associated with beta-coronavirus genus Sarbecovirus subgenus (Cluster B) and two bat-derived virus strains clusters.
New Crown virus and other bat-coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the genome-wide level of 96% consistency.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that pangolin virus and human virus in some parts of the genome sequence is only one amino acid.
Genome-wide comparisons to date have found that up to 92% of the genetic material between pangolin-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 is the same, not enough to prove that pangolin is an intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be diagnosed initially based on symptoms, but ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of infected secretions.
A PCR-CT comparison study in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific,and many imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and disease progression.
As of March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommended that“CT should not be used for COVID-19 screening or as the first test to diagnose the disease."”
The World Health Organization has released a number of nucleic acid detection program for SARS-CoV-2,the first program was released on January 17.
Nucleic acid detection using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory or blood samples can be used for testing.
The results are generally available in a few hours to a few days.
In general, this detection is carried out by the nasopharyngeal swab, can also be carried out by the throat swab.Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests for the detection of antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests proved to be sufficiently accurate to permit widespread use.
In the United States, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use by certified laboratories only in emergency situations.
Typical imaging features of X-rays and computed tomography (CT) in patients with onset include peripheral grinding glass shadow asymmetry and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database on the imaging performance of confirmed cases.
Because it coincides with other viral infections(such as Adenovirus), It is not confirmed by PCR images in the identification of COVID-19 specificity is limited.
Comparing chest CT results with PCR results, a large study in China found that although images were less specific for identifying infections, they were faster and more sensitive, so they could be considered as a means of screening in endemic areas.
A convolutional neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed, which can be used in combination with x-slice and CT to detect image characteristics of viruses.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good personal hygiene practices, frequent hand washing, avoiding direct contact with the eyes, nose and mouth without washing hands,covering the nose and mouth with paper towels when coughing or sneezing, and throwing the used paper towels directly into the trash.
Persons suspected of infection should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.
Measures to maintain physical distance are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.Many governments have restricted or recommended avoiding non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has now reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities where some residents have no idea where or how they are infected.Standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection should be taken by health care providers in contact with suspected infected persons.Contact tracing is an important means for health regulators to identify sources of infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of cell phone location data for tracking purposes has sparked concerns about privacy,and more than 100 organizations, including Amnesty International, issued statements calling for restrictions on such monitoring.
There are a variety of mobile applications have been put into use or into the proposal for voluntary use, as of April 7, 2020, a total of more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy protection solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
Users will be alerted once they have had close contact with a positive COVID-19 patient.False statements about preventing infection continue to spread; such as rinsing the nose and rinsing the mouth with mouthwash is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing.
It is recommended to stop the spread of the disease by washing hands frequently.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when there is significant dirt on their hands, before meals, and after blowing their noses, coughing or sneezing.
This is because the virus before entering the body, just use household soap to destroy its protective capsule, which play a role in killing the virus.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that you wash your hands with alcohol-containing hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol if you don't have soap and running water.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
The surface can be sterilized using a variety of solutions(disinfectant on the surface of the stainless steel can take effect within a minute), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solutions (such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate) less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and used ATMs, should be disinfected if suspected or confirmed cases of new-type coronavirus pneumonia occur in facilities such as offices or day-care facilities.
Who recommends that people cover their nose and mouth with bent elbows or paper towels when coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of all contaminated paper towels.
Medical surgical masks are recommended for people suspected of infection,as they reduce the amount of droplets exhaled when talking, sneezing and coughing and shorten the transmission distance.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on the use of masks and use of the occasion.
University of Leeds virologist Stephen Griffin said: "wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch the face, in the case of hand hygiene is not in place, touch the face is also a major source of infection”"In addition, it is recommended that personnel responsible for the care of suspected infected persons wear masks.
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for COVID-19 patients, but it also recognizes that wearing masks can help avoid touching the face.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric.China explicitly recommends that healthy citizens also wear disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact with others (within 1 meter (3 feet)).
Hong Kong, China recommends wearing masks when travelling by public transport or entering crowded places.
Thai health officials advise people to make homemade masks and wash them every day.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is strictly forbidden to enter public places without a mask or without shielding the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Viet Nam required all persons to wear masks before entering public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone to wear a mask when entering the grocery store.
Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public places.
Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March and has been required to wear masks on trains and intercity buses since April 1.
Panama requires masks to be worn on the go and recommends home-made masks for residents who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infection prevention and control measures related to social distance (also known as physical distance) are designed to minimize close contact between people and thus slow the spread of the disease.
Measures include isolation;travel restrictions; school suspensions, work stoppages and closures of stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
Measures that individuals can take to maintain social distance include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, switching to contactless greeting and keeping physical distance from others.
Now, many governments have imposed or recommended social distance in areas affected by the epidemic.
With regard to the maximum population size, the United States government agencies and who initially recommended 250 people (in areas without COVID-19 transmission), then quickly reduced to 50 and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.The elderly and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and impaired immune systems are at higher risk of severe illness and complications.The German CDC recommends that such people in the affected area should not go out as far as possible.In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health institutions began to replace the term”social distance“with”physical distance " to clarify that the aim was to reduce physical contact while still maintaining social contact, including virtual and long-range contact.
The use of the term”social distance " carries the meaning of requiring people to be completely isolated from society and does not encourage other ways to keep people connected.Some authorities have also issued guidelines on sexual health that apply during the pandemic.
Recommendations include having sex only with a partner who lives with a virus-free or asymptomatic partner.
It is recommended that COVID-19 patients and suspected infected patients be isolated at home.
Health institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation.Many governments have imposed or recommended self-isolation on all residents of affected areas.
The harshest self-segregation instructions were also issued to high-risk groups.
Self-isolation is recommended for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure to COVID-19 patients, or if you have recently been to a country or region with widespread transmission.
Outbreak prevention and control strategies include containment/containment and mitigation.
Containment applies in the early stages of an outbreak, with the aim of tracing and isolating infected persons, along with other infection prevention and control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to other populations.
If it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts should be made to transition to the mitigation phase: measures should be taken to slow the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of the disease on health systems and societies.
Containment and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.
Suppression requires more extreme prevention and control measures, by reducing the number of basic regeneration to 1 or less to reverse the pandemic situation.Part of the effort to control outbreaks of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the peak of the outbreak, which we know is to flatten the epidemiological curve.
This reduces the risk of health service systems collapsing and allows more time to develop vaccines and treatment programmes.
Non-drug interventions that can contain the outbreak include individual preventive measures,such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-isolation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as school suspension and cancellation of mass gatherings; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.In the face of a marked increase in the epidemic, China immediately adopted tougher measures to contain the epidemic, such as the closure of the city and the imposition of a strict travel ban.
Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures, and issued alerts on the trajectory of the infected.
Singapore provides financial support for self-isolation of infected persons and imposes heavy fines on those who refuse to self-isolation.
Taiwan, China, has increased its production of masks and imposed penalties on medical supplies that sell their products.Simulations of the United Kingdom and the United States show significant challenges in both mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (reversing the spread of the epidemic).
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce peak medical needs by two thirds and the number of deaths by half,but could still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of Health Systems.
Inhibition may be the first measure,but it needs to be maintained until the virus stops spreading in the population(or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever comes first), otherwise the transmission will bounce back quickly once measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions aimed at curbing pandemics have social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drug has been approved for COVID-19,but research and development is ongoing, including trials of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicine, rehydration and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusion and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the situation.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied to determine their suitability for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also notes that some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization notes that improving processing capacity and adapting health systems to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients are basic outbreak responses.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospital and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels,including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing,eliminating selective procedures where possible, segregating and isolating COVID-19-positive patients, and improving intensive care capacity through training of personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
Speculation about the origin of the first case (the so-called Patient Zero) is mixed.
The first known case of novel coronavirus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of novel coronavirus in Hubei province gradually increased.
Most of these patients are associated with the South China seafood wholesale market, which also sells live animals,one theory is that the new coronavirus is derived from one of the animals; or, in other words, from Zoonoses.On December 26, Zhang Jixian, a doctor at Hubei Hospital of integrated Chinese and Western medicine, first discovered and treated a group of unexplained pneumonia patients and reported it to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Jianghan District of Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a " SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were disciplined by the police for spreading“rumors", while Ivan, the other, was disciplined by his superiors for sounding the alarm.
Wuhan city health committee subsequently issued a notice on December 31, and reported to the World Health Organization.
Wuhan's health authorities started an investigation in early January after receiving reports of numerous cases of unexplained pneumonia.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
From the beginning of January to the middle of January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China due to the large population movement during the Chinese Spring Festival and Wuhan as a transportation hub and major railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including 2 in Beijing and 1 in Shenzhen.
Later official figures show that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms.As of March 26, the United States has more confirmed cases than China and Italy, becoming the world's most confirmed cases.As of April 9, 2020, the global cumulative reported more than 1.61 million confirmed cases;more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 cured cases.
Confirmed cases have been reported in about 200 countries and territories worldwide.
Affected by the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area have adopted preventive and control measures that restrict the free movement of people and establish border controls.
National responses include containment,such as isolation (also known as home orders, on-site asylum orders or closures) and curfews.As at 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the total population, were in some form of blockade in the United States, more than 50 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of blockade, and two days later that number rose to 2.6 billion, or about one third of the global population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan;an unconfirmed report speculates that the earliest case dates back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian found a number of unexplained cases of pneumonia on December 26, and his hospital reported the situation to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Jianghan District of Wuhan on December 27.
On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronavirus was detected in a preliminary genetic test of a patient sample.
Wuhan City Health Committee announced on December 31，
Reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.
After the notices were issued, several doctors in Wuhan were reprimanded by the police for“rumours”of The Walking epidemic.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no“clear evidence”of person-to-person transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Xi Jinping, the Communist Party's general secretary, later called a“people's war”to curb the spread of the virus.
On January 23, the government announced that a quarantine line in Wuhan, which was later extended to 15 other cities in Hubei, affected some 57 million people,“the largest quarantine event in human history."
Private cars are prohibited in the city.
Many places also canceled the celebration of the Chinese New Year (January 25).
The government has also announced the construction of a temporary Hospital, Mount Vulcan hospital, which will be completed and put into service within 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Thor Kamiyama hospital, was built to accommodate more patients.
In addition to the new hospital, China has transformed 14 other venues in Wuhan, such as the convention center and stadium, into square-cabin hospitals.On January 26, the government took further steps to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations to travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and primary and secondary schools throughout the country are also suspended.
A number of measures have also been taken in Hong Kong and Macao, China, particularly for primary and secondary schools and universities.
China has implemented remote home work in many places.
In addition to Hubei province, travel restrictions have been imposed on other identities.
Public transport has been adjusted,and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Public facilities are regulated in many cities,and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) are subject to some form of outdoor activity restriction.After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from“importing”from other countries and regions.
Beijing, for example, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all persons entering Beijing from outside the country.In the five days leading up to March 23, there was only one native case in mainland China, transmitted by a traveller returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that local case transmission has been basically contained, China's epidemic has been controlled.
On the same day, other Hubei regions, except Wuhan, began to release travel restrictions exactly two months after the blockade was imposed.On March 26, 2020, the Ministry of foreign affairs of China announced that it would suspend the entry of foreigners holding valid Chinese visas and residence permits from March 28.
Those who wish to enter China need to apply for a visa from the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to resume work on March 30 and provided a monetary stimulus package for businesses.The State Council announced that April 4 would be the national day of mourning and that a three-minute national mourning event would be launched at 10:00 on that day.The day coincided with the Qingming Festival, when the central government urged families to pay homage to their loved ones through the internet in order to maintain physical distance and avoid a second outbreak of COVID-19.
On January 20, 2020, South Korea has a confirmed case of COVID-19.
South Korean health agencies reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, mainly due to a new religious rally in Daegu, South Korea, the Xintiandi Jesus Church.
Xintiandi believers from Wuhan to Daegu are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261, or about 13%, of the 9,336 congregations reported symptoms.On February 23, 2020, South Korea announced that it has entered the highest alert level.
On 28 February, Korea reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, increasing to 3,150 on 29 February.
Three soldiers tested positive for the virus, and since then all South Korean military bases have been quarantined.
Flight schedules have also been adjusted due to the effects of the epidemic.South Korea has launched what is considered the world's largest and best-organized virus prevention and control program, which screens large populations, isolates all infected people, and tracks and isolates those in close contact with infected people.
Screening methods include mandatory reporting of symptoms by new arrivals from abroad through mobile applications,a drive-in virus test that will get results the next day,and increased detection capacity to accommodate up to 20,000 people per day.
Despite not isolating the City, South Korea's plan is seen as a success in preventing and controlling the outbreak.South Korean society initially polarized its response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many South Koreans signed the petition, calling for the impeachment of Mr. Moon, accusing the government of mishandling the outbreak,or praising his coping strategy.
On 23 March, the lowest number of new cases a day in four weeks was reported in South Korea.
The March 29 report said that from April 1, all new arrivals overseas will be isolated for two weeks.
According to the media reported on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus detection assistance from 121 different countries and regions.
On 19 February, Iran announced the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Qom and later, according to the Iranian Ministry of health, two patients died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers,and the complete suspension of universities, higher education institutions and primary and secondary schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said there were no plans to seal off areas affected by the outbreak, but only to isolate infected individuals.
In March, Iran announced plans to limit intercity travel,but intercity congestion continued until the Persian New Year.
Shia shrines in the QOM area have been open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020.In February, Iran became the center of transmission of the virus after China.
The extent of the outbreak in Iran is believed to have been masked,including the fact that, as of 28 February, cases in more than a dozen countries were traced back to Iran, suggesting that the actual outbreak in Iran was more serious than the 388 cases reported by the government as of that date.
The Iranian parliament was forced to close and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, human Rights Watch urged Iranian prisons to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peacefully expressing dissent and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It noted that the risk of transmission of the virus is greater in closed institutions such as detention centres and that these institutions lack adequate health care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number reported in the country since the outbreak.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
As at 23 March, Iran had 50 new confirmed cases per hour and 1 additional coronavirus death every 10 minutes.
According to World Health Organization officials, the actual number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than reported.
There is also the view that US sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial capacity to cope with the outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for human rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions on countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, two Chinese tourists were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome and confirmed to have spread to Italy.
The number of cases in the country then rose sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
From the 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February,an unrelated COVID-19 case was later identified.On 22 February, a cabinet meeting announced a new decree to curb the spread of the epidemic, including the isolation of more than 50,000 people in 11 different cities in northern Italy.
The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, declared: "access to the affected areas is strictly prohibited.
The epidemic area has ordered the suspension of work and suspension of sporting events."On 4 March, with 100 deaths in the country, the Italian government ordered the full suspension of schools at all levels throughout the country.

As at 5 April, Italy had a cumulative number of confirmed cases of 128,948, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cured cases,most of which occurred in Lombardy.
CNN has reported that Italy's large elderly population and a combination of factors that have so far failed to detect all infected persons may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK's initial response to the virus is considered to be one of the most lax in the affected countries.It was not until March 18, 2020 that the British government began to impose various forms of social distance or mass segregation on its citizens.
The British government has been criticized for its lack of speed and strength in responding to public concerns.On March 16, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending the elimination of any non-essential travel and social contacts, advising people to work at home as much as possible and avoid bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure facilities, including bars and gyms, should be closed as soon as possible and promised to cover up to 80 per cent of workers & apos; wages, up to a maximum of £ 2,500 per month, in order to prevent unemployment caused by the crisis.On March 23, the British Prime Minister announced tougher measures to keep society at a distance, banning gatherings of more than two people and prohibiting any travel and outdoor activities unless absolutely necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the announced restrictions were enforced by the police through fines and the dispersal of assemblies.
In addition to supermarkets,pharmacies,banks, hardware stores, gas stations and garages, most of the other businesses were ordered to shut down.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control (the United States government's leading public health agency) announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Nevertheless, the United States started slowly in testing, obscuring the true picture of the outbreak at the time.
Defective kits produced by the federal government in February, non-governmental kits (from academia, companies, and hospitals) were not approved by the federal government until the end of February, and restricted testing eligibility criteria were not established until early March (medical advice is required thereafter), all of which hindered early testing in the United States.

On January 23, in response to the central government's decision to impose measures to seal the city of Wuhan, who representative Colliers said that while it was“certainly not a recommendation from the World Health Organization”, it“fully reflects the determination to contain the spread of the epidemic from the most concentrated areas,”calling the move“unprecedented in the history of Public Health”.On January 30, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the sixth public health emergency of international concern since the first implementation of the measure during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
The director-general of the World Health Organization, Mr tammersai, noted that public health emergencies of international concern were determined on the basis of“the risk of global transmission, particularly to low-and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems”.
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Mr. tandersei said that“there is no reason to take measures to intervene unnecessarily in international travel and trade”and that“the World Trade Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and flows.”
On 5 February, the World Health Organization appealed to the international community to contribute $ 675 million to fund strategic readiness in low-income countries, saying there is an urgent need to support countries that“do not have a system to detect infected people.”
Mr. tammersai further issued a statement declaring that "the weakest link determines how strong we are”and urging the international community to" invest immediately or the costs will be greater in the future”"On February 11, the World Health Organization at a press conference decided to name the disease COVID-19.
On the same day, Mr. tandese said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed that“the UN will fully respond to the epidemic”.
To that end, the United Nations has launched a United Nations crisis management team to coordinate a United Nations-wide response.The World Health Organization says this would allow WHO to " focus on the health response,while others can use their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development impacts of the outbreak”.
On 14 February, a joint mission in China led by the World Health Organization (who) was launched to dispatch international and who experts on the ground to China to assist in responding to the local epidemic and assess“the severity and contagion of the disease”through seminars and meetings with key national institutions, and to assess“the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including different situations in urban and rural areas”through field visits.On 25 February, the World Health Organization declared that“greater global efforts should be made to fully prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic”and noted that, while it is too early to call it a pandemic, countries should still be“ready”.
In response to the ongoing outbreak in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation.On February 28, who officials said they had raised the global risk level of the Coronavirus outbreak from“high”to "very high", the highest alert and risk level for the methodology.
“This is a reality check for governments around the world: sober up, " Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program at the World Health Organization, warned in a statement.
The virus may be approaching, so be prepared”and urge governments to take the right response to avoid a“worst-case scenario " around the world.
Ryan further noted that the current data are not sufficient for public health officials to declare a global pandemic,so that the announcement would mean“we basically accept that everyone on Earth is likely to be exposed to the virus."”
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared a new Coronavirus outbreak to constitute a global pandemic.
The director-general of the World Health Organization stated that he was“deeply concerned about the thought-provoking proliferation and magnitude and the reality of inaction”.The World Health Organization has been severely criticized for its perceived mishandling of the global pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.
Strong opposition included a petition asking WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, which had been signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the need to respect the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group noted that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that governments should assume this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against specific groups.
The expert stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, groups living in extremely poor conditions, detainees and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are actively responding to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The organization for Economic Cooperation and development has launched a platform aimed at providing timely and comprehensive information and perspectives and recommendations on the policy response of countries around the world.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to addressing the impact of the embargo and travel restrictions, the Digital Centre has a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and promote global collaboration to address the challenge of the new coronavirus.
Michael Goff, the Cabinet Office Secretary of the United States and the United Kingdom, and Eduardo bosonaro, the son of Brazilian President Yair bosonaro, have criticized the Chinese government's approach as the pandemic first erupted in China's Hubei province.
The dismissal of several CPC provincial administrative officials for mishandling epidemic prevention efforts in central China reflects the central government's dissatisfaction with the response of local political institutions to the epidemic.
Some commentators say the move is aimed at averting public discontent with Xi Jinping, the Communist Party's general secretary, over the outbreak of the new coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, deny that the previously admitted COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan and support conspiracy theories that the new coronavirus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.
US President Donald Trump has referred to the new coronavirus as the“China virus”or“Wuhan virus,”saying that China's“censorship has exacerbated the spread of the virus into what is now a global pandemic,”which, in turn, has been viewed by some critics as a form of racial discrimination and“diverted attention from its government's failure to contain the virus.”
The Daily Beast received a cable from the United States Government outlining a communications strategy apparently sent out by the National Security Council, which said“all of this has nothing to do with China."
We were told to disseminate this information as much as possible in any way, including press conferences and television appearances”.Media outlets such as politicians, foreign policy and Bloomberg claim that China is providing aid to affected countries to promote its global influence.
Josep Borrell, head of EU foreign policy, warns that there is a“geopolitical factor that includes competing for influence through good offices and“generous politics”.
Borrel also said, " China is strongly advocating that it is a responsible and reliable partner unlike the United States.”
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and has reportedly provided assistance to the two countries.
On April 3, the 100,000 masks Ma donated to Cuba were blocked by United States sanctions.
The United States authorities have also been accused of transferring aid to other countries.
According to reports, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy and other countries between mask disputes.
In addition, Turkey intercepted hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU support for Italy affected by the new coronavirus.
“Only China has responded bilaterally, " said Italy's ambassador to the EU, Maurizio Massari.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European unity.”
On March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian troops to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy after a call with Italian Prime Minister Conte.
An anonymous“top political official”was quoted by the Italian newspaper news as saying that 80 per cent of Russia's aid“is of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of launching a”geopolitical and diplomatic " charm offensive.
Lombard governor Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "[Putin], in providing assistance to his US colleagues, believes that once US manufacturers of medical equipment and materials restore capacity, they will pay back if necessary.”
The NATO“defenders 2020”exercise, planned for Germany, Poland, and the Baltic Sea, is the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War and will be scaled down.
Kate Hudson, secretary-general of the nuclear disarmament movement, criticized the defenders 2020 exercise:“in the face of a global public health crisis, the exercise endangers not only the lives of military personnel in the United States and many European participating countries, but also the residents of the countries where the exercise is conducted."The Iranian government was severely affected by the outbreak, with about 24 parliamentarians and 15 other current or former politicians infected ”
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance.The letter pointed out that the United States sanctions on Iran caused Iran to not enter the international market, Iran in the fight against the epidemic difficulties.The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies that are common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and increased public health funding.
Political analysts expect the outbreak to have a negative impact on whether Donald Trump can be re-elected in the 2020 presidential election.Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated as a result of the global pandemic.
South Korea later criticized Japan's“vague and passive quarantine measures”after it declared that anyone entering Korea would be subject to a two-week quarantine at a government-appointed location.
South Korean society initially polarized President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many South Koreans signed the petition, calling for the impeachment of Mr. Moon, accusing the government of mishandling the outbreak,or praising his coping strategy.The pandemic prompted many countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators fear that this could lead the government to tighten its grip on power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's adoption of a decree suspending parliament and elections for an indefinite period and punishing anyone who is found to have transmitted false information about the virus and the government's crisis management.
Multiple supply shortages can be attributed to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, stemming from increased equipment use, panic shopping, and disruptions in plant and logistics operations worldwide to combat the epidemic.

Panic shopping has increased, leading to shortages of food, toilet paper and bottled water on shelves.
In particular, the technology industry has been warning of delays in the delivery of electronic products.
The demand for personal protective equipment has increased by a factor of 100, according to the director-general of the World Health Organization.
This demand has led to a 20-fold increase in the price of such products from their usual highs and a 4-to 6-month delay in the supply of medical supplies，
It also leads to a global shortage of personal protective equipment.The World Health Organization warned that this would pose a threat to health care workers.
In Australia, the pandemic offers new opportunities for purchasing agents to sell Australian products to China.
The campaign led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets, which was then banned by the Australian government.Despite the severity of COVID-19 in northern Italy and Wuhan, there is no serious food shortage in both places.
Measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding and illegal trade in key products have been very successful, averting serious food shortages, which are expected in Europe and North America.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not declined significantly,but industry representatives believe that prices may rise.
Emptying food shelves is only temporary,even in Wuhan,where government officials have released pork reserves to keep residents well nourished.
Italy has similar legal provisions requiring food producers to reserve supplies for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has affected China:retail sales plummeted by 20.5% in the first two months of 2020, as a result of government measures to contain the epidemic, according to a media report on March 16.

France and the United Kingdom have also adopted the German system of compensation for time-lapse work.
The Performing Arts and cultural industries have also been hit hard by the epidemic, which has spared organizations and employees and individuals worldwide.
The arts and Cultural Industries Organization strives to uphold its mission (usually funded by the government), to show the cultural heritage to the community, to maintain the safety of its employees and the public, and to support artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, performing arts venues and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and scheduled exhibitions, events and performances had been forced to cancel or postpone.
In response to this situation, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms.The outbreak will also result in the cancellation of many religious services, major sporting events and other social events (such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows) in the near future, and the negative impact will increase rapidly.

COVID-19 workplace prevention and control
COVID-19 workplace prevention and control refers to the use of hazardous Occupational Safety and health measures to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The adequacy of workplace hazard prevention and control depends on the specific work site and task and should be based on a risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of community disease, and the risk factors of vulnerable individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
As required by the United States Occupational Safety and health administration (OSHA), work at low risk exposure has the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues, so basic infection precautions are recommended, including frequent hand washing, encouragement of home isolation after illness, adherence to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Moderate risk exposure includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes staff who have access to the general public,such as schools,high population density work environments and some large-scale retail environments.
In addition to basic infection precautions, this group should use HEPA filters and sneeze guards for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment and other hazard prevention and control measures when exposed to COVID-19 patients.
OSHA believes that medical staff and mortuary staff who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients are at a high risk of exposure, which becomes extremely high if staff perform aerosol-generating operations on known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process specimens from them.
Hazard prevention and control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have serious effects in the workplace.
Staff members may be absent from work due to illness, need to care for others or fear of exposure.
Business models may also vary, including changes in demand for goods or access to them (such as shopping during off-peak hours, or using a delivery or drive-in delivery service).
Finally, product logistics from areas with serious COVID-19 outbreaks could be disrupted.Infectious disease prevention and response plans can be used to guide protective action.
These plans address the level of risk associated with a variety of workplaces and work tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from family and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the prevention and control measures needed to address these risks,as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may be subject to national or local recommendations.
The targets for responding to the outbreak include reducing employee-to-employee transmission, protecting populations at high risk of adverse health complications,maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response will be affected by the severity of the disease in the community in which the business operates.
Hazard prevention and control rating is a widely used prevention and control framework for Occupational Safety and Health, used to group hazard prevention and control measures according to effectiveness.
If COVID-19 is not completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control means isolating employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on their behavior to control them, which is the least costly solution to implement.
Administrative control refers to changes in work policies or procedures that require staff members or employers to act on their own initiative.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but helps prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the level of hazard faced by the staff, equipped as appropriate(e.g. respirators) and must always be properly worn, inspected and maintained regularly, replaced if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the US Occupational Safety and health administration (OSHA), low-risk work has the least professional exposure to the public and other colleagues.
Basic infection precautions are recommended for all workplaces, including frequent hand washing, home isolation for sick employees, respiratory etiquette when coughing or sneezing,provision of paper towels and trash cans, preparation for telecommuting, peak commuting when necessary, discouraging employees from using others ' tools and equipment, and keeping the workplace clean and disinfected daily.
Timely identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who exhibit acute respiratory symptoms be isolated at home for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there is no fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms, and that the sick leave policy be flexible, allowing employees to take care of family members who are sick, and that employees
Under OSHA, moderate exposure risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 m), but that may result in individuals contracting SARS-Covid-2 as a result of ongoing community transmission near the workplace or as a result of a possible recent visit to COVID-19 epidemic areas.
Such staff include those working in schools, high population density work environments and some high-volume retail environments that have access to the general public.Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include installation of HEPA filters,improved ventilation, physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze guards, and installation of drive-in Windows to provide customer service.Administrative controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging home isolation of sick workers, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing peak-to-peak shifts, eliminating non-essential travel to COVID-19 outbreak locations, developing emergency communications plans, including forums to answer staff questions, providing up-to-date education and training to staff on COVID-19 Risk Factors and protective behaviour, providing training to staff who need to use protective clothing and protective equipment on how to use them, providing resources and working environments that contribute to improved personal hygiene, requiring frequent hand washing, restricting access to work sites for customers and the public, and posting information on hand-washing activities. and other covid-19 protective measures.Personnel at a minimum risk of moderate exposure should be provided with personal protective equipment, including gloves, robes, masks or goggles, depending on the task.
It is desirable for such staff to be equipped with a respirator.
If a person becomes ill on board the aircraft, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers,including placing the patient beyond six feet from other passengers, assigning a crew member to serve the patient,providing the patient with a mask, or requiring the patient to cover his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick travelers, touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces.The crew should also wear additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveller has symptoms such as fever, persistent coughing or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be treated in biohazard bags, followed by cleaning and disinfection of contaminated surfaces.For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control measures also include delayed travel in case of illness.If you experience fever or other symptoms on board, you should isolate yourself and immediately notify the medical room on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the compartment of the quarantined person.For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends that if an infected person has been present in the school, schools and childcare facilities should be closed for a short period of time and thoroughly cleaned or disinfected, regardless of the community & apos; s spread.
For low-and medium-level community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented,such as eliminating other large gatherings such as field trips, gatherings and physical education classes, choral classes or cafeteria meals, increasing the distance between desks, peak attendance and departures, restricting access to non-essential visitors, and arranging separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
If the community spread is severe, then in addition to the implementation of social distance strategy, but also consider extending the suspension time.For law enforcement officers who carry out their daily routine activities, the CDC considers that they face lower immediate health risks.
It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who must have contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient or suspected individual act under the same level of protection as an emergency medical technician, including with appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during the arrest, staff members shall clean and disinfect their service belts and equipment before cleaning them with a household cleaning spray or rag, and shall observe standard procedures for sealing and disposing of personal protective equipment and for sealing and cleaning clothing.
OSHA believes that certain health care and mortuary workers are at a high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk workers include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who have actual contact with people known or suspected of COVID-19 infection.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if a worker performs droplet generation procedures on a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, or collects or processes specimens of an infected or suspected infected person.
Droplet generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or body cavity specimen collection.
High risk of exposure mortuary staff include those involved in the disposal of the bodies of deceased persons who had been diagnosed or suspected of COVID-19 cases before they died;they were at a higher risk of exposure if an autopsy was performed.Additional engineering measures for this risk group include isolation rooms for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, including during droplet generation procedures.
Some health-care facilities and mortuaries may also be equipped with specialized negative-pressure ventilation systems.
Biosafety Level 3 precautions should be taken when handling specimens.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that patients be assigned different waiting areas based on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that respirators be worn by persons working within 6 feet of patients with known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and by persons performing droplet generation procedures.
The United States requires the use of NIOSH-approved N95 filter masks or better masks in a comprehensive written respiratory protection program environment such as health testing, training, medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort.Who does not recommend the use of protective clothing, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and does not spread through bodily fluids.
Who recommends that screening personnel at entry points simply wear medical surgical masks.
Who recommends the use of medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves for staff who need to collect respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without performing droplet generation procedures.
If you want to perform droplet generation program, you must replace the medical surgical mask N95 or FFP2 mask.
In view of the global shortage of PPE, WHO recommends reducing the demand for PPE by means of physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, allowing only direct caregivers access to COVID-19 patients ' rooms, using PPE only when it is truly necessary for a particular task, continuing to use the same respirator when caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic persons.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than a million infections worldwide
The total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide reached more than 1 million on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were associated with covid - 19, a disease caused by coronavirus.
On the same day that milestone occurred, Malawi confirmed the country & apos; s first coronavirus infection and Zambia & apos; s first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 105,1635 confirmed cases,including 79,332 cases within 24 hours before 10: 00 a.m.(0800 UTC)on April 4, Central Europe time.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that coronavirus infection killed more than 1,000 people in the United States on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the date of closure to May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians across the country will continue to receive compensation during the shutdown until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia has extended curfews in Al-Quds Al-Mecca and Medina to full-day curfews; previously, curfews were only in force between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the home order until May 1.
2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle aches,diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The incubation period from exposure to the disease is 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
Although the symptoms are mild in most cases, some cases develop viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, 210 countries and territories worldwide reported more than 2.24 million cases and more than 153,000 deaths.
Currently, more than 568,000 people have been rehabilitated through treatment.The virus is transmitted mainly from person to person through close contact, often through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although exhalation will produce droplets, but droplets usually fall to the ground or various surfaces, and does not cause long-range transmission.
In addition, if someone touches a virus-contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose and mouth, they may also be infected with the virus.
The virus can survive up to 72 hours on the surface.
Although early onset and late recovery may also spread, but three days before the onset of the most contagious.The standard diagnostic method is to perform nasopharyngeal swab real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection.
It is recommended that people suspected of viral infection and their caregivers wear masks.
Recommendations for wearing masks by the public vary from place to place, with some authorities opposing them and others requiring them.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Most countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic, may also develop suspected flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include dyspnea,persistent chest pain or tightness,blurred consciousness,difficulty waking and blue face or lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.
Different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, were also monitored.
In some cases, chest tightness and palpitations only appear at the beginning of the Chinese case.
Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia,multiple organ failure, and even lead to death.
We call this the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected people develop symptoms within 11.5 days after infection.The report notes that not all infected people develop symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic infected persons in the spread of the epidemic is not fully clear; however, there is prima facie evidence that asymptomatic infected persons may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of asymptomatic infections has not yet been determined and studies are being intensified.The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 percent of confirmed cases showed no symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China has included asymptomatic cases in the daily notification since 1 April; of the 166 infected persons on that date, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.
Loud speech splashes more droplets than normal speech.
A Singapore study found that an unobstructed cough could cause droplets to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus does not normally spread through the air, the National Academy of Sciences has determined that it may be spread through bio-aerosols,and an air collector in the corridor outside the ward detected positive samples of viral RNA.
Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may atomize respiratory secretions and cause airborne transmission.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but the risk is considered low.The virus is most contagious when the patient develops symptoms;although it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) said that although the transmission power of the new Crown virus is not completely clear, but the average person can infect 2-3 people.The survival time of the virus on the surface varies from several hours to several days.
Specifically, the new Crown virus is known to survive one day on cardboard, in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (Aisi 304) can survive up to three days, in 99% purity copper products can survive up to four hours.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soaps and cleaners can also kill viruses.Soap products degrade the fat protective layer of the virus, making it inactive,while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.A study in Hong Kong, China, showed that saliva samples were taken on average two days after admission.
5/6 patients had the highest viral load in the first sample,and 1/6 of the patients had the highest viral load detected the next day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)is a novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, first isolated from a group of three cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan pneumonia patients.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus in nature are associated coronavirus presented.
Before the virus does not enter the body, it can be used to kill household soap, because soap can destroy the protective capsule of the virus.SARS-CoV - 2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19,because the virus enters the host cell through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the highest level in the lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus binds to ACE2 and enters the host cell through a special surface glycoprotein called“spines”(capsule particles).
In Wuhan, China hospital admitted patients, 12% of the infected persons found that the presence of acute myocardial damage, in patients with severe a higher proportion of.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is higher due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders caused by the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with the heart'S ACE2 receptor.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in regulating heart function.
It is reported that the incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) in COVID-19 infected persons under ICU supervision is higher and may be related to poor prognosis.COVID-19 lethal patient autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), see lymphocyte inflammatory infiltration in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is addicted to respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE2, but COVID-19 patients with severe systemic excessive inflammation occurs.
In particular, COVID-19 patients with pathogenic GM-CSF secreted T cells and inflammatory IL-6 secreted monocytes recruitment and severe lung pathology related.
Autopsy report also see lymphocyte infiltration.
WHO has published several disease testing programs.
The standard detection method is the use of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test typically tests respiratory samples obtained through nasopharyngeal swabs;however, nasal swabs or sputum samples can also be used.
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be carried out, but requires two blood samples to be collected at intervals of two weeks, the results are almost instantaneous value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish gene sequences to enable laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (not only to detect active infections,but also to detect whether an individual has been infected with the virus in the past) is still under development, but has not been widely used.
According to China's experience, the detection accuracy is only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the FDA approved the first immediate diagnostic reagent, and put into use at the end of the month.The diagnostic guidelines issued by central South Hospital of Wuhan University propose methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Early infection is more common double lung lobe grinding glass shadow, with peripheral asymmetric and posterior distribution.
With the development of the virus, there may be subpleural dominant, lithotripsy signs (lobular spacing thickening with varying degrees of alveolar filling) and lung consolidation.
Information on COVID-19 microscopic pathological injury and pathophysiology is minimal.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy are as follows：
Visual examination: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed：
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of lung cells, large number of atypical lung cells, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multicore giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Convalescent pneumonia: alveolar effusion mechanization and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); young white-young red blood cell response
To reduce the risk of infection, precautions may include: staying at home; avoiding access to densely populated areas; washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering the nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; if there is no tissue, it is recommended to cover the inside of the elbow.
It is recommended to properly clean hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends wearing a cloth mask in public to prevent the spread of the virus to some extent in asymptomatic patients.At the heart of the social distance strategy is the closure of schools and workplaces, restrictions on travel, and the elimination of large public gatherings, thereby reducing access to large groups of people living with HIV.
In addition, the social distance guidelines require at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in interpersonal communication distance.
There is no effective prevention COVID-19 drugs.Given that the vaccine is not expected to be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are key to controlling COVID-19 transmission,known as”leveling the epidemiological curve."
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when there is significant dirt on their hands, before meals and after blowing their noses, coughing or sneezing.
It is also recommended to wash your hands with an alcohol-containing hand sanitizer of at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap and running water around.For areas where no water-free hand sanitizers can be purchased, WHO offers two formulations for on-site production.
These formulations stimulate antimicrobial activity by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a " hand sanitizing active substance."
Add glycerin as a humectant.
Provide supportive care for people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that suspected carriers wear simple masks.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to relieve symptoms of respiratory failure,but its benefits remain to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain personal hygiene and promote healthy lifestyles and eating habits, thereby increasing immunity.
For patients with mild early infection, supportive therapy may be effective.Who and China's National Health Council launched an initiative to call for proper care of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.
American critical illness specialists and lung specialists have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions and made them available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, COVID-19 treatment has not been developed.
For some symptoms, some medical experts recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line treatment.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus,with particular attention to protection when performing aerosol-producing operations, such as intubation or hand ventilation, in a medical environment.
For health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that patients be transferred to an airborne infectious disease isolation room (AIIR) in addition to standard precautions, exposure precautions and airborne precautions.The CDC outlined guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during outbreaks.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing,respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves.If you can, it is better to use a respirator (not a mask).
N95 masks are approved for use in industrial applications, but the FDA has authorized the use of such masks under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
It is mainly used to prevent the inhalation of suspended particles (such as dust), but for other purposes does not guarantee effective isolation of specific biological agents.
If there is no mask, the CDC recommends the use of a mask, if necessary, you can also wear a homemade mask.
Most COVID-19 cases have mild symptoms and do not require mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Paramedics are actively working on research to provide respiratory support to COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms.There is evidence that nasal high flow oxygen therapy or biphasic positive airway pressure ventilation can avoid intubation.
It is not clear whether the two treatment options for severe patients have the same effect.
If conditions permit, some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, because compared to the high flow through the nose oxygen therapy, this technology can also limit the diffusion of aerosol particles.Severe cases in the elderly (over 60 years of age, especially the elderly over 80 years of age) mainly.
In many developed countries, where the number of beds per capita is insufficient, the health-care system cannot cope with the critical situation of hospitalization resulting from the surge in COVID-19 cases, given medical conditions.
A study in China found that 5% of patients need to be sent to intensive care, 2.3% need mechanical ventilation,1.4% will die.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients in China are eventually sent to ICU.
With the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation is further improved, oxygenation more and more difficult.
A ventilator that supports pressure control mode and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung damage and chest damage caused by the ventilator.
Older ventilators may not achieve high PEEP.
Research on potential therapies has been under way since January 2020, and a number of antiviral drugs have entered clinical trials.
Redcivir seems to be one of the most promising drugs at the moment.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Severe patients can try antiviral drugs.
Who calls on volunteers to participate in potential therapy efficacy and safety trials.The FDA has temporarily authorized convalescent plasma transfusion as an experimental treatment for critically ill patients dying of life.
The necessary clinical studies have not yet been conducted to prove that the therapy can safely and effectively treat the disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile app to curb the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number as required.
The app detects“close contact”with monitoring data to determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
Once a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also alerts local health officials.Using mobile data big data analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected people and people in Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track cell phone data of suspected coronavirus carriers.
The purpose of this measure is to enforce segregation and to protect groups that may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom and the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to share aggregated mobile phone location data in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect people who violate isolation rules.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera notes that data from mobile phone operators show that " 40% of citizens are still moving around”.
The German government hosted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus on a global scale.
Isolation,travel restrictions,treatment for side effects, or fear of infection can be troubling.
The BBC quotes Rory O'connor as saying, " social isolation, loneliness,health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are the perfect storms to hurt people's mental health and well-being.”
The disease is mild, with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks,while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to data from other similar viruses (such as SARS and MERS), pregnant women are at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 severe patients, but lack COVID-19 data support.COVID-19 may have an effect on some people's lungs, which can lead to pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 May rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include sepsis, coagulation abnormalities, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients with abnormal coagulation, especially prothrombin prolonged, while the group had 4% of patients with renal dysfunction.
About 20-30% of COVID-19 patients liver enzyme (transaminase) increased.
According to the same report, the average time from onset to death was 10 days, with an average hospital stay of five days.
However, the average time patients transferred to ICU hospitalization to death is seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time from the onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days,with an overall time range of 6 to 41 days.
A study by China's National Health Council (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
Autopsy lung samples histopathological examination showed that both lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage with mucus-like secretions of cellular fibers.
Viral cytopathies were observed in lung cells.
Lung imaging is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by the National Health and Health Commission in China, 11.8% were caused by heart damage due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data released in March in the United States, 89% of admitted patients have a previous medical history.The availability of medical resources and regional socio-economic conditions may also affect mortality.
Disease mortality estimates vary due to regional differences and methodological difficulties.
Underestimation of mild cases may lead to overestimation of mortality.
However, if the case death is due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop COVID-19 patients with severe illness,requiring intensive care or dying approximately 2.4 times more likely.Concerns have been expressed about the long-term sequelae of the disease.
The hospital authority of Hong Kong, China, found that the lung capacity of some of the survivors fell by 20% to 30%, and the lung scan display was damaged.
In addition, post-intensive care syndrome may be faced after rehabilitation.
As of March 2020, it is uncertain whether past infections will provide effective long-lasting immunization for those recovering.
According to the behavioral characteristics of other coronaviruses, immunity may be identified,but some COVID-19 cases have been reported to have been tested positive for coronavirus shortly after recovery.
It is believed that these cases are a continuous deterioration of the infection rather than re-infection.
This virus is considered a natural virus, originating in animals, infected by spillage.
The actual origin has not yet been determined,but as of December 2019, the range of infection is almost entirely interpersonal.
The first 41 confirmed COVID-19 case studies published by The Lancet in January 2020 show that the earliest onset date is December 1, 2019.
The earliest onset date reported in WHO official publications is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are often used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by Region, change over time and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the number of tests, the quality of Health Systems, treatment options, when the outbreak first erupted, and age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed deaths of COVID-19 but not laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The fatality rate is equal to the total number of deaths within a given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global fatality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The fatality rate is also different in different regions.Other measures include case mortality (CFR), which reflects disease deaths as a percentage of confirmed people, and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects disease deaths as a percentage of infected people, both confirmed and undiagnosed.
These statistics are not time-bound and track the entire process from infection to case resolution in a particular population.
Although not all infected people will produce antibodies, but the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infections.
The Italian outbreak centre, Castiglione d'adda, is a small town with a population of only 4600, and 80 people (1.7 per cent) have died from the outbreak.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various carnival days, even affecting young people,but the mortality rate is relatively low,not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
Moreover, the German health-care system is overburdened.
Blood donor assessments indicate that about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
To date, 69 people (0.004% of the total population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary by gender.
Chinese and Italian studies have shown that men have a higher mortality rate than women.
Men aged 50-60 are at the highest risk of death,with only the 90-year-old age group having a similar gender gap.
The mortality rate in China is 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of such gender differences are unclear,but may be due to genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based immunological differences lead to lower rates of smoking among women and lower rates of comorbidities (e.g. hypertension) among men than among women, resulting in higher mortality rates among men than among women.
In Europe, 57% of men are infected, and 72% of all deaths from COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked gender-related data on COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
There is a higher proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) and a higher risk of exposure to the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease "COVID-19".
Who head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained this:CO stands for "coronary", VI stands for "virus", D stands for "Disease", and 19 stands for when the outbreak first erupted(December 31, 2019).
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographic locations(for example, China), animal species or populations, in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigmatization.COVID-19 caused by the virus is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, WHO also uses the“COVID-19 virus”and“causing COVID-19 virus " in Mass Communication.
Diseases and viruses known as " coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as“coronavirus”and“Wuhan coronavirus.”
In January 2020, who recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary viral and disease names based on the 2015 guidelines on the use of locations in disease and viral names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers began printing health care materials such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, an Italian hospital is in urgent need of ventilation valves, suppliers are unable to deliver parts within the required time, and a local start-up reverse engineer the 100 ventilation valves needed to be printed overnight.
After the initial COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease spread rapidly through the internet.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
No evidence of viral replication was found in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines for the treatment of this disease have yet been approved.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a“solidarity trial”to assess the therapeutic effect of the four existing antiviral compounds that are currently most likely to produce efficacy.
There is no vaccine yet, but candidates are actively being developed at all levels.
Since SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV - 2 are through ACE2 receptor into human cells, and therefore need to take advantage of SARS-CoV previous work results.
Three vaccine strategies are being studied.
First, researchers plan to develop an all-virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead virus virus, which aims to provoke a rapid immune response in the body when a new infection COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop a subunit vaccine, which aims to develop a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focused on S-thorn proteins that assist virus invasion of ACE2 enzyme receptors.
A third strategy is the development of nucleic acid vaccines(DNA or RNA vaccines,a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the experimental vaccines developed in each of these strategies must be tested.On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched their first vaccine clinical trial.
Vaccines contain harmless gene sequences that are copied from the virus that caused the disease.It has been argued that antibody-dependent enhancement may be a major challenge in the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this claim is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials have been conducted.
Seven trials were evaluated and approved for malaria treatment,including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Conversion of antiviral drug use accounted for the vast majority of research in China,nine Phase III clinical trials on redcivir will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates has begun.Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including redcivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir combination interferon β.
As of March 2020, the efficacy of redcivir has been preliminarily confirmed.
It was observed that the clinical symptoms of patients treated with the sympathetic drug redcivir have been alleviated.
Phase III clinical trials are currently under way in the United States, China and Italy.In February 2020, China launched a chloroquine (previously used to treat malaria) study and obtained preliminary results.
However, there was a call for a peer review of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1 gram per day, while reminding that twice the dose is very dangerous and even potentially fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but the doctor has the right to decide whether to use these two drugs to treat COVID-19 patients.China's seventh edition of the guidelines also proposed the use of interferon, ribavirin or arbidol hydrochloride treatment COVID-19.
Preliminary data show that high doses of Ribavirin in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.
After confirming the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to use nitzonit for further in vivo studies.Studies have shown that the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) - induced original thorn protein is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor interaction into the body.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies have serious limitations, whether used in combination with azithromycin or not, and these therapies cannot be accepted by the medical community unless further research is undertaken.Oseltamivir in vitro no inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19 has not been found to have a therapeutic effect.
Cytokine storm can become a complication of late treatment in patients with COVID-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.After completing a small study, the National Health Council of China included tolzumab in the treatment guidelines.
Following positive results in severe cases, Italy is conducting a national Phase 2 non-randomized trial.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests, cytokine storms are identified to curb disease progression, and cytokine storms are believed to cause death in some infected individuals.
In 2017, with the support of a retrospective case study, the FDA approved the use of interleukin 6 receptor antagonists for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by other causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there is no randomized control evidence that propzumab can be effective in the treatment of CRS.
Research is currently under way to extract purified concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of COVID-19 survivors and inject them into people who need them as passive immunotherapy before the vaccine is developed.
This strategy has been tried during the SARS outbreak, but the efficacy is inconclusive.
Viral neutralization is an expected mechanism of action of passive antibody therapy mediated SARS-CoV-2 immune defense.
However, some other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis can achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The amount of serum produced during rehabilitation may increase, facilitating rapid deployment.Serum consists of a liquid part of the blood of a rehabilitated patient, which contains specific antibodies against the virus.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, raised his awareness of the spread of the new Crown virus, which unfortunately contracted COVID-19 and died.
Australian stores reduce the maximum number of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australia's chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the per-transaction toilet paper buying cap for all their stores nationwide to two packs and one pack, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of messages at the cashier or posted to the chain's Facebook page.
The report said buyers were hoarding goods for fear of COVID-19 in case they needed to segregate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the number of toilet paper purchases delivered to their doorstep to a single package.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced a limit of 4 packs per transaction on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles reported in its March 8 press release that“many stores are still sold out within an hour of arrival "after imposing a 4-pack limit, calling the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that it“was not expected."
According to a Woolworths spokesman, last week's sales“surged."
Last week, Canberra's Costco store also limited the allowed quantity to two packs.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries,Woolworths ordered additional inventory,and ALDI prepared inventory ahead of schedule for the scheduled Wednesday specials.
Australian Retailers Association executive director Russell Zimmerman said retailers are trying to increase inventory,but local council restrictions on truck delivery times make this difficult.
He expects that as suppliers try to meet demand, production costs will rise and preferential activities will decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday specials after the early release of inventory.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store replenished its inventory every night.
Toilet paper, he said, is bulky and therefore less in stock and, once sold out, leaves huge shelf space, exacerbating the feeling of a shortage of supplies.
The point of Coles and Woolworths is that if there are so many things on the shelves that goods like web and hand sanitizer are[available]and in sufficient quantities, you might not be so panicked.Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they're out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who makes Shu Jie toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent toilet paper, both emphasize that they are working around the clock, on weekends, to ensure supply.
Real estate website Domain.com reports that some real estate agents will offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne due to fewer auctions held due to buyers taking a long weekend off on Labor Day.
NT News is a daily newspaper printed in the city of Darwin, containing an 8-page insert in its Thursday edition, intended for use as toilet paper after cutting.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, the store was initially reluctant to implement the purchase limit,they said they did not plan to implement the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other goods was also high, including masks,hand sanitizers, dry goods, hand sanitizers and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 2 packs of 12 rolls per pack on Sunday night.

Since this month, we have encountered some difficult circumstances.
In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we clearly felt the shared destiny of all mankind, but also recognized our responsibility to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best way to address them requires people around the world to be empathetic, collaborative, and community-building, which is at the heart of Wikimedia.
The sharing of love and care among all colleagues through e-mail, telephone and chat is a testament to the difference between our colleagues and how fortunate we are to be able to work with them.
I am extremely grateful and proud to be a colleague with you.
Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is for the world to use Wikipedia at this moment, and the symbolic power of keeping this critical resource up and running for people around the world.
Whether your job is to run your website, pay for it, or secure your community, Wikimedia's success depends on your hard work.
The world today needs information from Wikipedia more than ever before.
At this stage, what we do and how we do it will have an important impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities of our colleagues, we will begin next week to make some important changes to the way we collaborate.
Modus operandi and schedule adjustments
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss how and how the company will work over the next few days to months.
At the meeting, we considered what we saw as appropriate responses to the current challenges facing companies, as well as best practices to ensure their sustainability during the outbreak.
The executive team agreed to reduce the pressure on the company's employees, so that everyone can support the company's mission for a long time.
We support you in reducing stress.
For all employees, contractors and contractors：
Our daily work hours will be adjusted to 4 hours a day(or 20 hours a week)and will be subject to change.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice.If you can work longer every day, we will arrange tasks according to your working hours.
However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we prioritize your personal needs,such as caring for your family, going shopping or visiting a doctor.
We do not track your working hours.
If you are sick, put down your work.
This is self-evident, but we want to remind you, please rest assured.
You don't need to take sick or paid leave, but you need to inform your manager and help your team revise work calendars and schedules to ensure that critical areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of talent and cultural operations, who will support you and ensure that your situation is properly addressed by management .）
For hourly employees, we pay in full.
We have already expressed and renewed our commitment to abide by our commitments to contractors and hourly workers.
The salaries we pay to all will continue to be calculated on the basis of the remuneration they receive for normal working hours.
Even if you are sick or unable to work.
If you are willing to work, we will support you.
Many people choose to work to communicate with the outside world and release their stress.
Our work can be incredibly rewarding,especially in times like this.
But taking care of yourself is still the first.
We ask you to keep in touch with your manager so that we can keep you up to date and make adjustments accordingly.
Priority to protect important work.
We must keep some important work running.
The work done by the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operations team, the trust and security team, and the fundraising team (and others) is critical and may require additional support.
We will begin to work with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting some of the issues that are critical to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
A temporary slowdown will not affect future development.
We are not going to“work overtime”after the outbreak.
We will not ask you to work overtime to catch up with the schedule, because it seems impractical now.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.
How will the app (annual plan) change?
In order to adapt to new realities and daily work time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan, in exchange for more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize critical work and take care of themselves and their families, and adjust work schedules for those who need or want to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.
An extended schedule can significantly reduce the current planned workload and work pressure across the organization.
We will make that proposal to the board next week.If the proposal is adopted, we will update the follow-up programme of work to delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in the process.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague from the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But, out of caution, we hired some antiviral cleaners to completely disinfect the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade disinfection solutions to disinfect various surfaces, as well as halls and elevators leading to our floors.
The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement, using the corresponding products to protect the safety of tenants.
We believe that when you decide to return to work, the office is well prepared to welcome you.
Our Washington DC office uses the WeWork office, which shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington DC staff.
As of last week, The Washington DC office has moved to full telecommuting, following the guidance we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some colleagues in the New York office already know, we have been discussing the issue of renting office space in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue,but may be postponed.
Some colleagues first contact telecommuting.
Other long-term telecommuting colleagues would like to give them some advice on how to adjust their working methods：
Meeting time should be limited to one to two hours.
For longer periods of time, consider splitting the meeting into meetings on multiple dates.
Clearly define the objectives of the meeting, set the agenda for the meeting, and send reading materials in advance.
Use video conferencing as the default meeting mode,and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to collaborate and connect online.
In each meeting, have a moderator lead the meeting, have one person in charge of monitoring questions in the chat window and track changes to the list of speakers, and have another person in charge (or in a collaborative manner) to help with the minutes.
If you need a comfortable headset, please contact technical support by email.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Join the#remotes channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The human resources operations team is working on webinars in the form of ergonomic guidance to help all Foundation colleagues increase productivity during distributed work.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public activities funded by Wikimedia, such as edit pine, before who announced the end of the epidemic.
We have informed them of our understanding that these cancellation and other restrictions may prevent these community recipients from completing their original donation activities, while pledging that no one of them will be penalized for delaying or modifying these goals.
Over the next week, we will continue to provide more guidance at Wikimania and other regional community meetings and thematic community meetings.
The global community now seems to be shrouded in grief over the devastation caused by the outbreak,but it also reflects relief from being able to focus clearly on their communities, Wikimedia, and others.
In the future, the CRT team will build a page on the Meta-Wiki to provide the community with a space to monitor impact and track community communication with us.
Stay in touch and communicate COVID-19 related issues
We plan to have a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 Pacific time,and we'll send the relevant invitations to your calendar later.
At the meeting, we will share some updates,answer your questions and set aside some time for discussion.
We are here to help.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT team keeps these pages up to date and puts all the information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries currently severely affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, major workflows, or insurance, or need other assistance, feel free to contact and work with the CRT team.
We are here to provide you with the support and contact you need.
If you have confidential or sensitive questions, please contact Bryan Judan, head of global human resources operations, by email.
While we face these changes, we cannot give up our jobs and obligations.
On the contrary, the outbreak has made us realize that we may now need to adjust our work and obligations in ways we have never done before.
We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to support each other in continuing their work,to provide the support needed for our actions and to continue to bring the services on which they depend to the world.
Always make a good plan, can not be afraid of challenges.
Now, please support each other to create space for the next few weeks or months of important work.
We need everyone to contribute to this goal, so please take care of yourself and your family so that you can stay in top shape when you need it.
Finally, please remember to wash your hands frequently and do not touch your face.
Katherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 “suspected cases”and“confirmed cases”
On February 6, 2020, our team released the quick recommendations guide for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, through which we provide lessons for the global response to the epidemic.
However, 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease, based on ongoing research and clinical experience, our understanding of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In the present letter, we respond to one of our comments on the above guidelines and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for“suspected cases”and“confirmed cases”in accordance with the latest COVID-19 treatment plan (seventh edition) issued by the National Health and Health Commission of the people's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 New coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, the disease has been officially named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the virus was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide, which was published online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted widespread attention.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease and our knowledge of the disease is gradually improving based on ongoing research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Council of the people's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, a total of 7 versions of the COVID-19 treatment plan were released,some of which have undergone substantial changes.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou et al., who propose a simple scoring scheme based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guide and a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We recognize and thank them for this important work.
However, their proposal also needs to be updated in the light of the latest COVID-19 treatment plan (pilot version 7) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases requires a combination of an epidemiological history feature with two clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis, or, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical manifestations need to be met.：
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or residence history in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities that reported COVID-19 cases within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infections(nucleic acid positive); (3) History of exposure to fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities that reported COVID-19 within 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) ≥ 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, such as Home, Office, school class, etc.) have a history of exposure.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with COVID-19 infection imaging characteristics; (3) early onset of leukocyte count is normal or reduced, lymphocyte count is reduced.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases, and any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 was positive; (2) genome-wide sequencing of the virus showed highly homologous with the known novel coronavirus; (3) serum tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies were positive; or SARS-CoV-2
We can see that the second edition (January 18, 2020) and the third edition (January 22, 2020) increased real-time PCR nucleic acid detection in respiratory or blood specimens.
The fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth edition (February 8, 2020) added pathogen testing for blood specimens; later the seventh edition added serological evidence.
These modifications are based on the ongoing work of researchers to study the optimal nucleic acid assay kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory samples, including blood collection, which increases the availability of different specimens and provides evidence for the inclusion of positive results for specific antibodies in the diagnostic criteria.
In addition, a growing body of evidence draws our attention to both atypical and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated,because they will not have clinical symptoms of people classified as " low risk”"
In addition, the scoring system also needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we hope for more direct evidence and appeal to readers for comments.
For the diagnosis of”suspected cases“and”confirmed cases", we recommend that you consult and follow the latest guidelines in the country where the case is located.
Our team will also update our guide to help.
Bangladesh reported 5 new COVID-19 deaths,a single-day high
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths that day.
This hit a new high in one-day deaths due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and research(IEDCR)reported a record of 114 confirmed cases and 33 cured after rest at home.
A total of 17 deaths.
In an online press conference, IEDCR head Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over the age of 60,two between the ages of 51-60 and one between the ages of 41-50.
She also said that two of the dead patients were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization(who)announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11.
One of the dead patients was Jalal Saifur Rahman, head of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been treated at Kuwait Maitree hospital, a hospital official told local news media Anadolu Agency.
On Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of road transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, announced through an online video that public transport outages would be extended beyond the initial schedule until this Saturday.
The public transport outage began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Basic goods, such as medical care, fuel and food, continue to be transported normally.
On 8 March, two of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh returned from Italy, and one of the other patients was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.
As of 19 March, all three patients had recovered.
Who declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the continuing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic.
Although the term”pandemic " refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease and not to the degree of risk of a particular case, the WHO notes the need to urge governments to take measures：
"All countries can still change the process of this pandemic.
If countries respond by testing, testing, treating, isolating, tracking and mobilizing their people,”said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
“We are deeply concerned about the alarming level of proliferation and gravity and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is“unprecedented.”
In a comment on CNN in February, he said“ " apart from the flu, no respiratory virus has been found to continue to spread around the world after its appearance.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said“ " We've never seen a Coronavirus-induced pandemic before.”
“Likewise, we have never seen a controlled pandemic before, " he continued.”
Before entering the new state of the pandemic, WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the outbreak,“most importantly, it's still getting worse.”
As of Thursday, The Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, leading to more than 4600 deaths.
Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses in 2019 include testing for the presence of viruses and for the production of antibodies after infection.
RT-PCR detects coronavirus RNA and thus determines whether the virus is present in the sample.
This test is a specific test for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.
It can be used to determine whether recently infected or active infection.
Antibody testing (serum testing) can be used for diagnosis and Population Monitoring.
Antibody testing shows how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with mild, unreported or asymptomatic symptoms.
This test results can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease, as well as the level of population immunity.
Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country could provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As at 23 March, no country had more than 3 per cent of its population tested, and the number of tests completed varied significantly from country to country.
This discrepancy may also have a significant impact on reported case mortality, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays with throat swabs can only be performed within the first week of infection to obtain reliable results.
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR assays using pharyngeal swabs can only be completed within the first week after infection with the virus to obtain reliable results.
After that, the virus disappears in the throat,but continues to multiply in the lungs.
For an infected person who is tested in the second week after infection, the sample can be replaced with a deep respiratory extract obtained through a sputum suction tube,or coughing up (sputum) can be used.
RRT-PCR was released in January 2020 at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, one of the early PCR assays and the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (who).
On January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed a test method.On January 28, 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It looks for all beta-coronavirus common”E " gene, as well as SARS-CoV-2 unique rdrp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to be approved by the State Drug Administration for the emergency use of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through the international reagent Resources Division.
Earlier versions of the test kit used three genetic tests,one of which was unable to determine results due to reagent defects,while the Atlanta CDC was experiencing testing bottlenecks; this resulted in the average number of successfully processed samples per day of less than 100 throughout February 2020.
The two-part test was not confirmed until February 28, 2020,when the state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
This test is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.American commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announced that COVID-19 RT-PCR-based testing will be available nationwide from March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also announced that COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit is declared; sample collection and processing must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 detection by the National Center for Virology and biotechnology (VECTOR) is responsible for the development and production.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federation health supervision service.On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a kit to detect COVID-19 infection.On March 13, 2020, a Roche Diagnostics test method was approved by the FDA to complete a large number of tests in 3.5 hours, enabling approximately 4,128 tests per device in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency license (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing using Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued similar licenses to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, a test method for Cepheid, which takes about 45 minutes, was also approved by the FDA for emergency use.
The FDA has approved a detection method using isothermal amplification of nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since this method does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, therefore, only 5 minutes can be obtained positive results, negative results can be determined within 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such units in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day.Taiwan is developing a method that uses monoclonal antibodies (specifically binding to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus) to provide test results within 15 to 20 minutes, like a rapid influenza test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that,“in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of chest slices is small, and CT [computed tomography] performance may be obvious, even before symptoms appear."”
Typical characteristics of CT include double lung lobe grinding glass shadow, with the outer periphery of the asymmetric and rear distribution.
As the disease progresses, it will develop subpleural dominant, lithotripsy and pulmonary consolidation.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan (where the current pandemic first erupted) showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and that many of its imaging features overlapped with other pneumonia and diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommended that“CT should not be used for COVID-19 screening or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19."Starting in March 2020, the CDC recommends the use of PCR for initial screening.
Partial immune response to infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about 7 days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immune status of the monitored population.Assays can be carried out in a central laboratory (CLT) or by instant detection (PoCT).
High-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these measurements,but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by a sequence of samples, but it is usually measured using a peripheral blood sample.
For PoCT, a skin puncture is generally used to obtain a blood sample.
The extraction step is not required before the measurement, which is different from the PCR method.On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the detection methods declared by 29 entities that are now able to distribute their antibody test kits.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one Test under an emergency license.In late March 2020, Aumont medical laboratory diagnostics AG and Epitope Diagnostics were approved in Europe for testing IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
With the ability to detect hundreds of samples in a matter of hours, the determination of viral RNA is much faster than conventional PCR assays.
In general, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the start of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough.
Hong Kong has set up a mechanism for suspected patients to stay at home,“emergency rooms provide patients with sample test tubes”, patients spit saliva into the test tube, and then send the test tube back, the results will be received later.The NHS has announced that it is piloting a home-based program to detect suspected cases, which would eliminate the risk of infecting others when they go to the hospital and of having to disinfect ambulances after they use them.When carrying out a drive-in test for suspected COVID-19 cases, healthcare professionals can take appropriate precautions to take samples.
The drive-in Test Center has helped South Korea perform the most extensive tests faster than other countries.In Germany, the National Association of statutory health insurance physicians said on March 2 that out-of-hospital facilities had the capacity to perform approximately 12,000 tests per day, compared with 10,700 tests in the previous week.
If the test is carried out at the doctor's request, the cost is covered by health insurance.
According to the director of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's total weekly testing capacity is 160,000.
As of March 19, drive-in testing has been provided in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany is not known,as only the number of positive test results have been reported.
An initial laboratory survey showed that at least 483,295 samples (including Week 12 in 2020) had been tested and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 as of Week 12 in 2020.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for simultaneous testing of samples of 64 patients, that is, aggregated samples and further testing only if the combined samples were found to be positive.In Wuhan, BGI has temporarily established a 2,000-square-metre emergency testing laboratory called”Fire Eye", which is operational on February 5, 2020 and can handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was built five days under the supervision of Wang Jian, the founder of the gene in China, modeling shows that, if not to achieve the above detection capabilities, cases in Hubei will be 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment isolation costs will double.
Following the Wuhan laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately have established the fire eye Laboratory, currently a total of 12 cities in China to establish the laboratory.
By March 4, 2020, the daily throughput of laboratory tests totalled 50,000 copies per day.Origami Assays ' open-source, multi-channel design enables COVID19 testing of up to 1,122 patient samples with just 93 assays.These balanced designs operate in small laboratories without the need for automatic pipettes.
As of March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents have become barriers to large-scale testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some sponsors to explore sample preparation scheme, which involves heating the sample to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further detection.The United Arab Emirates announced on 31 March that it had now tested a larger number of its population, more than in any other country, for the new Crown virus, and was expanding the level of testing to allow large numbers of people to be tested.
This capability is achieved through the use of drive-through testing and the funding of a high-throughput laboratory to respond to large-scale crowd testing needs from Group 42 and huadegen, based on its Fire-Eye Emergency testing laboratory in China.
Built over 14 days and capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day,the laboratory is the world's first laboratory of this size to operate outside China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different detection methods for each part of the Cov gene map.
The World Health Organization has adopted the method of manufacturing test kits in Germany to send kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German method was announced on January 17, 2020;the program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be available until January 28, limiting the ability of the United States to detect.Both China and the United States encountered problems with the reliability of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak, and both countries and Australia were unable to provide enough test kits to meet demand and recommendations from health experts.
In contrast, experts believe that widespread testing in South Korea is helpful in reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Thanks to the testing capacity established by the Korean government over the past few years, it is concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programmes as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic.The widespread spread of the virus has led to a huge demand for testing, which has left hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents have become strained.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test kit.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC has a“defect”; subsequently, the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that hinder private laboratory testing.Spain purchased the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Yirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and found that the test results were inaccurate.
The company explained that inaccurate test results could be the result of incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of test kits.
The Spanish cabinet said it would recycle the kit that returned the wrong result and replace it with another kit from Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits purchased in the Czech Republic from China have incorrect results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China and found inaccuracies.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube.Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test boxes that Turkey purchased from China had“a high error rate”and did not“put them into use”.The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test boxes from China and declared them unusable in April 2020.
A positive effect can be obtained by isolating and tracking the exposure history of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons who were tested positive.
Researchers working in the city of Vò, Italy, where Italy's first COVID-19 patient died, conducted two rounds of testing for a total of about 3,400 people, each about ten days apart.
About half of them tested positive and asymptomatic,and all cases found were isolated.
New infections were completely eliminated by imposing travel restrictions on the community.
Through large-scale contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and isolation, the rate of transmission of coronavirus 2020 in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not adopted extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many activities were cancelled in Singapore and residents were advised to stay at home on 28 March,but the school resumed on 23 March after the holidays.
Several other countries, such as Ireland and South Korea, have also managed to contain large-scale epidemics through large-scale contact tracing, travel restrictions on entry, testing and isolation, and less aggressive closures.
A statistical study found that countries with more tests had lower case mortality compared to the number of deaths, possibly because they were better able to detect groups with mild or asymptomatic symptoms.
Who recommends that countries with no testing capacity and limited experience in handling COVID-19 in national laboratories send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the“test positive% " column is affected by the country's testing policy.
In all other cases, the positive detection rate was higher in countries where only hospitalized persons were detected, compared to countries where all citizens, whether or not they showed symptoms, were tested.
Between January 1 and March 15, 2020, the cumulative incidence of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK increased rapidly
In various countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) showed a similar trend, confirmed that although different countries at different stages, but COVID-19 pandemic are developing rapidly.
In Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units all need to be better prepared to meet the surge in COVID-19 patients, especially in intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the CDC reported that the pathogen is a novel coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the disease was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia,and most can recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 will progress to critical illness and require hospitalization,while the remaining 6% of cases will progress to critical illness and require intensive care.
The death rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in COVID-19 cumulative morbidity in various countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU / EEA countries and UK
Following China, the geographic distribution of COVID-19 has expanded,and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to that of China.
On March 11, 2020, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of the "European Surveillance" magazine, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe according to who's case definition.
In EU / EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020, patients returned to Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries, as well as in the United Kingdom, and 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported from December 31 to March 15, 2019, inclusive, with Italy alone reporting 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Cumulative number and incidence of COVID-19 cases acquired
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases notified by each country worldwide at 8:00 a.m. every day, only through official sources, such as ministries of Health, National and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data have been used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU / EEA and the UK and compared with Italy.
We calculated the cumulative incidence of 14-day interception of COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom between January 1 and March 15, 2020 as an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, in order to take into account the natural course of COVID-19.
We also provide the total cumulative number of reported cases in each country as of 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020 and compare them with data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU / EEA countries and the UK
The trend in the cumulative incidence of 14-day interception of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased since around 21 February 2020 and then sharply around 28 February (supplemental material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy,but the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries, as well as in the United Kingdom, shows a similar increase (supplement).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020, compared with Italy.
It is important to note that, as of 8:00 am on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases notified by the EU/EEA and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The observed cumulative morbidity trend of COVID-19 indicates that outbreaks are developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages,national public health responses vary,the definition of cases may vary from country to country, and the options used to select patients who must undergo covid-19 confirmed tests, including additional tests, vary, but the situation is the same.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, about 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care, and media reports that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have reached the maximum capacity.
At the EU / EEA level, currently available data are only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases admitted to/or into the intensive care unit, respectively (data not shown).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner to supplement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of beds available in intensive care and medium-term care varied widely across European countries, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and medium-term care per 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
ECDC &apos; s sixth update to the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment modeled the health-care capacity saturation scenario and estimated the relationship between the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom and the risk of exceeding the number of intensive care beds & gt; 90%.
Since cases have so far gathered in the EU / EEA countries and some regions of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually provide services to determine the coverage of the population area, it is best to provide information about cases and intensive care beds in the” standard statistical area Unit 2 " (NUTS-2) level.
The experience of Italy, as well as current trends in other countries, suggest that the EU / EEA and covid-19 pandemic in the UK are developing rapidly.
Therefore, the state, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to cope with the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care,such as in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is critical to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as rapid growth in the expected number of cases may leave policymakers and hospitals with insufficient time to understand, accept, and adjust responses if not implemented early.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is now a short window of opportunity through which countries can step up controls to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, health care systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Zoonotic origin of human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptability has been promoting coronavirus (Coronaviruses, CoV)and its host(including humans) co-evolution.
Prior to 2003, it was known that there were two human coronavirus (HCoV) can cause minor diseases, such as the common cold.
Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have reversed the situation and revealed the destructive and fatal nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has once again brought CoV to the fore,and surprisingly, it has strong transmission but low pathogenicity compared to its sister virus, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease,so it would be helpful to understand the origin of hcov's zoonotic disease.
Most HCoV from bats, and non-pathogenic.
Some HCoV intermediate storage host has also been known.
Identification of animal hosts has a direct significance for the Prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of CoV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the available knowledge of the seven Hcovs, highlighting their discovery history, zoonotic origin, and interspecific transmission.
Importantly, we compare and control different Hcovs from the perspective of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, we explore the current 2019 epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, this article focuses on the requirements for successful host conversion and the effects of Virus Evolution on disease severity.
CoV belongs to the coronavirus family and consists of a group of righteous single-stranded RNA viruses with an envelope.
These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, containing 26 to 32,000 bases, and are known as”coronavirus“(CoV) due to their coronavirus morphology under an electron microscope.
Structurally speaking, CoV has a non-segmented genome sharing similar organizations.
About two thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicating enzyme polymerase proteins.
These polypeptides are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 ~ 16.
The rest of the genome contains structural proteins ORF, including Thorn (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Many lineage-specific co-proteins are also encoded by different lineage CoV.
According to differences in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four genera (Alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and δ-CoV), of which beta-CoV contains most Hcovs and is subdivided into four lineage (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of gamma-CoV and δ-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has crossed species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
To date, seven species of human-infected coronavirus (HCoV) are known.
Where HCoV-229E and HCoV - NL63 is α-CoV.
The other five beta Covs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms,such as the common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly discovered SARS-CoV - 2 is highly pathogenic, leading to severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients, and are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS)and pulmonary manifestations.
In the mid-1960s, the first HCoV-229E virus strain B814 was isolated from nasal secretions in patients with the common cold.
Since then, through extensive research on both can cause self-limiting symptoms of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 virus, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge.
In fact, prior to the outbreak of SARS, the concept of infection HCoV is usually harmless has been widely accepted.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 is one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude fatality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the outbreak continued to spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to the rest of the world.
The 2019 New HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the persistently endemic 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3,2020.
The alarm has sounded and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven hcov species have zoonotic origin from bats, rats or domestic animals.
A variety of evidence suggests that all hcov's evolution originated in bats, where viruses are well adapted and pathogenic, but exhibit great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic poses enormous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges to China and the world at large.
Tracing the zoonotic origin of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the Natural History, drivers and constraints of viral species jumping.
In addition, it will guide or promote the SARS-CoV-2 storage host, intermediate host and expand animal host looking for the Prevention of future viral overflow is important.
In this review, we outline the origin, interspecific transmission, and pathogenesis of zoonotic disease of HCoV.
In particular, we emphasize and explore a common topic, namely hcov parental virus in its natural storage host is usually not pathogenic, but after cross-species spread to the new host pathogenic.
In addition, we also reviewed the evolution of HCoV trend, in this trend, the increase in transmittance is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
In this context, we also discussed the outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Since the late 1930s, animal CoV has been widely known.
Before the first isolated hcov-229E strain B814 from nasal secretions in patients with the common cold, medical scientists have isolated different CoV in a variety of infected animals (including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs).
In the past few decades, seven kinds of HCoV have been found.
A brief chronological summary of the history of HCoV discovery (Table 1) provides us with a wealth of information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E virus strain isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort, sore throat,and 10 to 20% of patients have fever, cough and other symptoms.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent successive passages in the brain of mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to that of HCoV-229E infection, with no significant differences in symptoms compared to other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and rhinovirus infections.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide, mainly in the winter transmission of temperate climates.
Typically, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, after about two weeks of onset.
A study of human volunteers showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E develop mild common cold.
Only a few patients with immunocompromised showed severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS,also known as”atypical pneumonia", is the first fully documented pandemic in human history caused by HCoV, the causative agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV was found.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
The SARS epidemic led to 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to the Super communicators, it is estimated that each case may bring about two secondary cases, the incubation period of 4 to 7 days, the first 10 days of viral load peak.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed myalgia, headache, fever, discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress and other advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
In addition, in patients with SARS also observed diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages.
Then about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these patients with severe illness, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, including a plurality of organs may also be infected, and usually accompanied by cytokine storm, which may be fatal in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy performed by a relative of a patient travelling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been committed to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
In diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, common rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study showed that the same virus was isolated from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis (also called grub laryngitis).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to Community-Acquired Pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was also reported to be associated with acute asthma attacks.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four community-acquired HCoV have been well adapted to humans and are usually less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases.But there are also accidents, and the cause is unknown, such as a more toxic HCoV-NL63 rare subtype, recently reported that the subtype caused serious lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoV gain the ability to spread effectively and sustained survival in the human body, their toxicity or pathogenicity will be reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary transmission to close contacts.
In 2015, secondary transmission erupted again in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also have acute renal failure,which is so far caused by HCoV disease unique characteristics of MERS.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported,with a 34.4% fatality rate, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to man.
In mid-late December 2019, patients with clustered pneumonia were found in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and were confirmed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection by retrospective analysis.
The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern, and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been diagnosed globally,with a crude fatality rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the fatality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the fatality rate outside Hubei is 1.2%.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe respiratory infections, manifested as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although due to 82% of the high nucleotide sequence homology, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV - 2 is very similar, but they are clustered into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic, but more contagious.
There have been reports of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection, which may accelerate the rapid spread of the virus around the world.
Comparing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 with six other Hcovs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
At this point, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other six kinds of HCoV.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms ranged between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired Hcovs (i.e. HCoV-229E,HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics in community-acquired HCoV infection is more common, including non-specific, mild or even asymptomatic performance.。HC HC HC HC HC HC HC HC HC Hc的 HC HC，HC SAR HC HC HC HC HC HC Hc的 HC HC 。 
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infections, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also showed interesting pattern characteristics of community-acquired HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted at least as high as community-acquired HCoV.
On the other hand, whether the spreadability of SARS-CoV-2 will decline after passage in humans like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV remains to be verified.
Finally, as with other Hcovs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
At least in some cases, SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission as if it plays an important role in the SARS-CoV, it remains to be clarified in future studies.
In addition, it is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community-acquired HCoV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenicity, and continued transmission after passage, will have an important impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All four species cause mild symptoms of community-acquired HCoV have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have also been well adapted to these four kinds of HCoV.
In other words, both may be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
Hcov leading to serious human disease and suffering from severe HCoV disease have died out.
To this end, HCoV must be sufficient replication in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations, thereby fighting host limiting factor.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more people are infected, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop by isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, these four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread among populations, leading to the common cold in immunocompromised people.
These viruses do not require an animal host.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans, nor can they continue to spread in humans.
They need to survive and multiply in zoonotic hosts, and possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and expanded hosts, looking for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets.
SARS-CoV - 2 with SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and four kinds of community-acquired HCoV similar characteristics.
It is as highly contagious as community-acquired HCoV,at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it can fully adapt to humans and circulate within humans without a host or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, first discuss hcov evolutionary host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host and expand the definition and characteristics of the host, we have some guiding significance.
If an animal has a nucleotide sequence at the level of highly homologous closely related ancestor, the animal will become an evolutionary host HCoV.
Ancestral viruses are usually highly adaptable and pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the storage host will continue to carry HCoV long-term.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected, and is a natural host HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV just parasitic in the middle of the host shortly after or immediately and parasitic in the human body, it will not be well adapted to the new host, and usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection, and by allowing the virus to replicate briefly, and then spread to humans to expand the scale of human infection, thus playing a role in amplifying the host.
If HCoV can not maintain its spread in the intermediate host, the terminal infection may occur.
Instead, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts, and even establish long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural storage host.
Retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that indexed cases of SARS had a history of exposure to hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence surveys showed higher levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV in animal traders compared to the general population.
For the first time in the live animal market, a beaver and a civet were found to carry a SARS-CoV-like virus almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus.
This view is indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS reports have been made after all the Beavers in the market have been removed.
However, the report said that farm Beavers in the wild or not exposed to the live animal market were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the Beavers may be just an intermediate amplified host rather than a natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that, since the Guangzhou market 80% of different animals have SARS-CoV antibodies, and therefore can not rule out a variety of small mammals may also act as SARS-CoV intermediate host may expand.
All these animals seem to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent studies of natural animal hosts of SARS-CoV found a closely related bat coronavirus, known as SARS-related Chrysanthemum head bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), survived in Chinese Chrysanthemum head bat.
These bats were positive for the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat-Cov have 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
In addition, the researchers also identified a variety of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) from bats,but in addition to a specified WIV1, no virus can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known SARS-CoV receptor.
Experiments show that wiv1 extracted from bat stool samples using bats, Beaver and human ACE2 as its receptor into the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of patients with SARS convalescence is able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of bats SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although these two viruses are highly homologous, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent of SARS-CoV virus, bats are not a direct storage host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV and bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5 grouped into the same group.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV invade the virus using the same host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is closer in phylogeny to the corresponding RNA in bat beta-CoV from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative bat CoV-HKU25 only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct storage host MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that llamas are seropositive to MERS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies, as do camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
Isolated from the nose swab llama live MERS-CoV and the human body found the same virus, which further indicates that the camel is MERS-CoV real storage host.
It should also be noted that in the experimental infection MERS-CoV camels, the general symptoms are mild, but a large number of virus shedding was observed.
It is worth noting that infected camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for bats to distribute the virus.
However, the problem remains,as many MERS-confirmed cases have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which may be attributed to human-to-human or unknown routes of transmission, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV - 2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology to the bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from the Chrysanthemum-headed bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parental relationship.
In other words, unless the future discovery of almost the same bat coronavirus, otherwise the bat may not be a direct storage host of SARS-CoV-2.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be sold and slaughtered in the South China Sea wholesale market of wild animal species, many of the original COVID-19 cases are associated, suggesting that animal-to-human transmission may have occurred.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have shown that an endangered small mammal known as pangolin (Malay pangolin) may also carry ancestral beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin-Cov genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are equally closely related to RaTG13, about 90% homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
In phylogenetic trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2-like virus subtypes, one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 and has 97.4% amino acid sequence homology.
In stark contrast, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 greater difference, although both genome-wide sequence homology is higher.
An earlier study of diseased pangolin also reported detection of viral overlaps from lung samples, with a similar relationship to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different assembly methods and manual processing to obtain a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the whole genome of the virus.
We cannot rule out that pangolin is one of the hosts of SARS-CoV-2 Intermediate animals.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from pangolin due to differences in β-CoV sequences associated with SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 even shorter than the distance between the SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolin, and other mammals remains to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, but SARS-CoV-2 related β-CoV,SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It can be highly speculated that the high similarity pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD between the selective-mediated convergence caused by evolution.
Another opposing view is that pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 recombine in a third wildlife species.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread in β-CoV.
The origin of direct zoonotic disease of SARS-CoV-2 is inconclusive.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the researchers also studied hcov-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and hcov-HKU1 zoonotic origin.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may both originate from bat-coronavirus,while hcov-OC43 and hcov-HKU1 parental viruses have also been found in rodents.
The report says that the three-colored bats found in North America are called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) bat coronavirus showed closely related to HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, is genetically linked to another bat-coronavirus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008), and camels are also suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, Figure 1 and Table 2 summarizes the existing knowledge about the origin of known hcov animals.
Phylogenetic analysis provides evidence for inter-species transmission events of HCoV in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from livestock across species, there was a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases.
The history of interspecific transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
Closely related to hcov-229E bat α-CoV has been found.
Between the two appeared an alpaca Alpha-CoV.
There is multiple evidence to support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may come into contact with bats in a common niche.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, the HCoV-229E associated bat α-CoV has diversity and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca α-CoV is caused by the outbreak of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca Alpha-CoV was not found in wildlife.
Therefore, we can not rule out the possibility of obtaining HCoV-229E related alpaca α-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, nipa and Hendra.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Or, although the bat Alpha-CoV acts as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and llamas may be intermediate hosts for the transmission of the virus to humans, exactly the same as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good illustration of inter-species transmission from bats to llamas and from llamas to humans.
The MERS-CoV evolutionary origin of bats is known in its initial identification, and subsequent findings reinforce this argument.
Obviously, bats provide a rich library of virus species for inter-species exchange and inter-species transmission of gene fragments.
Long-lived and dense population, close social interaction and strong flying ability are bats become ideal”virus communicators " favorable conditions.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the body for decades.
It adapts well to these camels,and the camels have evolved from an intermediate host to a stable natural storage host.
MERS-CoV cause very mild disease in these animals, and maintain a relatively low mutation rate.
Its sporadic spread to humans is an accident,and because it can not continue to spread, humans are still MERS-CoV terminal host.
The role of pangolin in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV.
In particular, pangolin β-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolin.
They may be the terminal host of the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, similar to the beaver in SARS-CoV.
In future studies must identify or exclude several possible SARS-CoV-2 spread from animals to humans between species.
First, bats may be almost identical with SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2-related virus storage host.
Humans may share the niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolin may be one of the intermediate expanded hosts of the new invasion of SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
Humans are infected by killing and eating game.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
It is necessary to conduct antibody surveys on livestock and Wildlife.
Third, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may recombine and adapt in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolin.
The study of animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors in terms of the virus in promoting coronavirus across the inter-species barrier also played an important role.。三 三 三 病毒 病毒 病毒 病毒 病毒 。 。的 三 病毒，病毒 病毒 病毒 冠 病毒 。 。 。 。的 三 。 。 
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.
The mutation rate of coronavirus is estimated to be“medium”to“high”compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, with an average substitution rate of about 10-4 times per year per site 2 based on the stage of coronavirus adaptation to the new host.
Coronavirus has proofreading activity of RNA exonuclease, its removal will lead to very high variability and attenuation, even unable to survive.
Interestingly, it is known nucleoside analogs redcivir (Remdesivir)can inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting such RNA exonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Redcivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of coronavirus is about 1 million times higher than its host.
In addition, if the coronavirus is not well adapted to the host, the mutation rate is usually high.
Compared with SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower, indicating a higher adaptability to humans.
Presumably, it has adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the llama.
In theory, gene drift is unlikely to cause rapid failure of vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, coronavirus larger RNA genome has additional plasticity in gene mutations and recombinant modifications, thereby increasing the possibility of inter-species co-evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronavirus when appropriate conditions.
A large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions towards the genome 3' terminus encode provide evidence for this.
Third, coronavirus RNA replication process through a unique“copy selection”mechanism randomly and frequently switch templates.
In the host as a mixing vessel, CoV RNA during transcription will occur frequently strand exchange.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNA can be recombinant to produce new coronavirus.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in hcov-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal coronavirus such as bats SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Viral-host interactions associated with transmission
In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor affecting inter-species transmission.
This paper takes the reorganization of SARS-CoV as a typical example and shows the evidence of positive selection in interspecific propagation events.
Based on a comparative analysis of isolated strains of human and Beaver SARS-CoV, the researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially by mutation of the S protein RBD to achieve this process.
Typically, RBD in coronavirus s protein interacts with cellular receptors and is closely screened for host antibody responses.
In SARS-CoV in, RBD is located in the first 318-510 amino acids S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors, so that the virus enters.
The RBD of SARS-CoV identifies ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoons, allowing the virus to spread across species.
In fact, in RBD observed only six human and civet virus isolates of different amino acid residues, of which four residues are located in the receptor binding motif and ACE2 receptor interaction.
The presence of k479n and s487t mutations in RBD of SARS-CoV in Beaver, which may increase the affinity of fibroblasts to human ACE2 receptor interactions.
In other words, the substitution of these two amino acids may be essential for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have the same cellular receptors.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S protein S1 unit was 30%, which means that its binding affinity of S protein and human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a frozen electron microscopy study showed that this binding affinity than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV s protein 10-20 times higher.
To determine whether any other co-receptors in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 would also make sense.
Interestingly, HCoV - NL63 is also combined with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other hcov receptors, such as HCoV - 229e aminopeptidase N and HCoV-OC43 9-O-acetylated sialic acid.
They may also explain the above-mentioned coronavirus after cross-species spread from animal hosts successfully adapted to humans.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of inter-species transmission of HCoV is also affected by other host-dependent and limiting factors.
Differences in these host proteins between humans and natural hcov hosts such as bats, llamas and rodents may constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
HCoV must deprive the host dependency and break the host constraints, in order to successfully achieve inter-species transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants of viral-host interactions in this important area have yet to be identified and characterized.
An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependencies and constraints of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may yield results.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to square one
The diversity of bat coronavirus provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new Hcovs.
In this sense, bat coronavirus acts as a gene pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and Gene recombination are also drivers of HCoV evolution, but also two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes may revolutionize the phenotype of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV auxiliary protein, since the isolated SARS-CoV associated bat virus, but found that they can encode different orf8 protein, so that orf8 is important for adaptation to humans.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, in isolated strains found 29 nucleotide deletion characteristics of SARS-CoV.
This deletion will be divided into Orf8 ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered to promote host conversion adaptive mutations.
In addition, SARS-CoV may occur with α - and γ-CoV lineage recombination, which found a large number of smaller recombinant regions in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
In nsp9, most nsp10 and part nsp14 also found the recombination sites.
Similarly, studies have shown that the prevalence of MERS-CoV experienced a recombination event between different lineage, which occurred in Saudi Arabia llama.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in other HCoV recombinant events were also observed, in which HCoV and other animal coronavirus recombinant in its non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may lead to unexpected changes in the viral genome, which is likely to be due to reduce the selection pressure of the host immune system, such as the face of the virus exerted.
An example of these effects is hcov-229E prototypic virus strain, the lack of dual-nucleotide leads to the deletion of full-length ORF4.
Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, but alpaca Alpha-CoV showed a single nucleotide insertion, causing a shift code mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by reservoir host selection pressure.
After infection with coronavirus in bats, asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected, indicating that coronavirus and bats adapt to each other.
From an anatomical and physiological point of view, bats seem to have adapted well to coronavirus.
For example, a defect in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response of bats effectively reduces the pathological changes caused by coronavirus.
In addition, due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and the main histocompatibility complex class I molecular expression level is low, so the natural killer cell activity of bats is inhibited.
Moreover, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by high metabolic activity in bats can inhibit coronavirus replication, but also by ribonucleic acid exonuclease proofreading effect, so as to produce highly pathogenic strains when entering the new host provides selective pressure.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to suit the host.
Therefore, in the past two decades there have been three new HCoV is not accidental.
Coronavirus in bats and camels and other storage host does not cause disease or cause mild symptoms.
They do a lot of replication, and does not cause a strong host immune response.
This is why there are asymptomatic carriers and causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms occur mainly due to over-activation of the immune response and cytokine storms, so the stronger the immune response,the more severe the lung damage will be.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy off-chain immune response may have a positive effect in anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The response to interferon in bats is particularly strong.
Therefore, at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection using Type I interferon should be beneficial.
In addition, bats NLRP3 inflammatory body activation is also defective.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 inhibition of NLRP3 inflammatory body may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were produced.
Although it has been found with SARS-CoV with 95% nucleotide homology bat β-CoV, but there is a bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology up to 96%.
Although it has been found in the market Beaver and other animals carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, but has not been identified direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
It has been found with SARS-CoV-2 significantly homologous pangolin β-CoV, suggesting that pangolin may be one of the intermediate host, or pangolin β-CoV may contribute to the final version of the gene fragment of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally artificially created.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus is back in focus.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the origin of zoonotic hcov disease and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
Extensive evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and beavers on the market, closing the wet market and killing beavers can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Similarly, given the discovery of multiple lineage of pangolin beta-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolin should be removed from the wet market to prevent the spread of zoonotic disease.
But whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolin and other mammals remains to be further studied.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been around in llamas for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the locals.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as the Chinese wildlife market has done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrence of MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge, causing outbreaks.
Zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in the wild.
In particular, bat-coronavirus, with zoonotic potential, is highly diverse.
These zoonotic coronavirus has many opportunities for evolution and recombination, leading to the future emergence of new coronavirus in humans more likely to spread and/or fatal.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural host, until there is an overflow opportunity.
Although bats have many characteristics that are conducive to the spread of the virus, human exposure to bats and other wild species is greatly reduced if people are educated away from bats and other wild species.
In order to better understand the ecological status of coronavirus and its natural host, it is necessary to continuously monitor mammals, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In summary, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans should be away from the zoonotic host of the natural niche.
The mystery of the origin of zoonotic disease in SARS-CoV-2 remains missing.
First,if bats spread an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolin, it makes sense to examine under what circumstances bats and pangolin can share the same niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans interact with bats remains to be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolin.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection studies should be conducted.
If bats, pangolin or other mammals, it is expected that the future will be found in the natural host SARS-CoV-2 or almost the same parent virus.
Continuing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
