The b ' Covid-19 app is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 Corona Virus Outbreak, helping track close contacts and identify individuals who may have been exposed to infected people ("contacts").
Some areas and jurisdiction have developed or proposed many applications with the support of the official government.
Many of the framework for building close contact tracking apps have been established.
Privacy issues are also raising multiple concerns, especially some systems that need to track the geographic location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth Signals to record the distance between users and other phones.
On December 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that it would integrate this feature that supports Bluetooth app directly into android and ios operating systems.
In China, the government and paypal have jointly developed an app to support citizens to self-check if they have been exposed to covid-19 patients.
The program is currently in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an app called tracetogether.
The app, developed by the local it community, was released as an open source software and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app " stopkorona!" to track exposure of potential infected people and help medical institutions respond quickly.
The app was developed by the north Macedonia ministry of communications technology and the ministry of health.
As of December 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from Google play store and Apple app store.
On January 12, the government announced that the close contact tracking app has entered an advanced stage of development and will be put into use in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch similar apps ("Stopcovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar apps based on Singapore's trace app and bluetrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geographic fence app for covid-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow to ensure patients don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at University of Cambridge, listed some of the practical problems with the app system, including false positive misreporting, and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small percentage of the population use the app.
To stop the spread of misleading or harmful " Corovirus " Apps, Apple has set limits on the type of organization that can publish corovirus-related apps in Apple app store, i.e. only " official " or other well-known organization.
Google and Amazon both impose similar restrictions.
Privacy Advocates have expressed concern over the use of corona app for mass surveillance, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure built to respond to the corovirus outbreak should be dismantled after the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for a limit on this surveillance.
These organizations announced eight conditions to be met for government projects:
Surveillance must be " Legal, necessary and proportionate
Monitoring and surveillance extension must have a "Sunset" clause;
Data collected for covid-19 purposes only;
Data Security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence that it is actually protected;
Digital Surveillance must avoid aggravating discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with a third party should be defined by law;
There must be guarantees against data abuse and citizens the right to respond to data abuse;
Calling for all " relevant stakeholders "" effective participation "" including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German chaos computer club (CCC) and reporter ohne grenzen (RSF) also issued a checklist.
Google / Apple's proposed plan aims to address ongoing monitoring issues and remove it from device operating systems once tracking is no longer needed.
Some countries have adopted location tracking based on web rather than apps, where users don't need to download the app while avoiding being tracked.
Web-based tracking has been approved in Israel.
Web solutions with access to original location data could have serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only use central servers to communicate with each other are now created (see below).
South Korea has launched an app-based system to perform contact tracking tasks.
Instead of using dedicated apps, the system opts to collect tracking information from various sources, including mobile devices tracking data and credit card transaction data, then combines that information to send notifications to potential infected people via SMS.
In addition to using these information to remind potential close contacts, the government has also been allowed to disclose location information as the country made major changes to the information privacy act following the outbreak of mers outbreak.
This information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Other countries (including Germany) are considering using both centralized systems and privacy protection systems.
As of December 6, 2020, the details have not been announced.
Privacy Protection Close contact tracking is an accepted concept, with a large number of related research literature dating back to at least 2013 as of December 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy protection solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Power (ble) to record the distance between users and other phones.
Pepp-PT is a coordination program that includes centralized and distributed approaches, not a single agreement. The dispersion protocol includes dispersed privacy protection neighborhood tracking (DP-PPT), temporary contact numbers (Tcn, formerly known as contact event number, Cen), privacy sensitive agreements and mobile contact tracking mechanism (PACT).
Under these agreements, identifiable personal data never leaves the device and all matches are done on the device.
The privacy team at mit media lab has been developing safepaths platform that uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or path crossover data to track covid-19
The platform is based on research on the white paper on app rogue: maintaining personal privacy in outbreak, published in December 2020 in addition to that, ENIGMA MPC, a company, originally founded in mit media lab and dedicated to developing privacy technology, is developing a similar platform called safetrace.
Safetrace uses security hardware technology to support users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On December 5, 2020, some groups joined together the global tcn alliance around basically the same approach and basic overlapping agreements with the goal of reducing fragmentation information and supporting the global mutual of tracking and alert applications operability, which is a key to achieving a wide range of applications.
On December 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that its official government app is using the open source bluetrace agreement.
Google and Apple, which controls android and Ios mobile platforms respectively announced a close contact tracking plan, claiming Bluetooth Low Power Technology with privacy protection combining technology can protect privacy.
In addition, they released core technical norms used in the system.
Apple and google say the system plans to launch in three stages:
Introducing tools to support the government in creating an official corona tracking app that protect privacy
Integrating this feature directly into ios and android systems, Google and Apple plan to launch the system first through an operating system update, which will be removed in the same way after the epidemic threat to address the follow-up monitoring problem.
Hand washing, also known as hand cleansing, is the act of cleaning your hands to clear the dust, Grease, microbes or other useless material.
Persistence on washing hands with soap at some " critical moments of the day can prevent the spread of many diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted through dung-mouth.
If people don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membrane), they can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common cold.
Five Key moments of the day to wash your hands with soap: before and after urination, cleaning the child's hips or after changing diapers, before feeding, before and before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If there is no soap and water, you can clean your hands with grass ash. The World Health organization recommends washing hands in:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of patients.
After changing diaper or cleaning the toilets kid's hips.
Wipe your nose, cough or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food or animal poop.
Medical staff hand hygiene refers to sanitary habits associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before prescription or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
In the medical field of medical care, the main objective of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microbiome that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause disease.
Hand washing is especially important for people working in food processing or working in the medical field, but washing is also very important for the public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, corovirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
And reducing infant mortality at home delivery.
A study in 2013 showed that improving hand washing habits could contribute slightly to the height of children under five years old.
In developing countries, child mortality related to respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by advocating for simple behavioural change (such as washing hands with soap).
This simple act could reduce the death rate of these diseases by nearly 50 %.
Advocating for hand washing could reduce about one third of diarrhoea cases, with the effect of providing clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap can reduce diarrhoea by 48 % as a spontaneous act in families, schools and communities around the world, washing hands with soap is the most effective and acute respiratory infections (acute response infections, Ari) cheapest way.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death of children under five years of age, which kills about 1800 million children every year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3500 million children dead each year.
UNICEF says turning hands with soap before meal and after toilets can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, halve deaths caused by diarrhoea by nearly half the resulting deaths were reduced by a quarter.
As part of the water supply, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) project, other hygiene interventions are usually accompanied by advocating for hand washing.
Hand washing can also prevent pustules transmitted through direct physical contact.
Hand washing can have a minor negative effect that frequent hand washing can cause dry skin and cause skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing leads to itchy, chaps, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among medical staff.
Excessive frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of OCD.
Five Key moments in order to reduce disease's dung-mouth spread, make sure to wash your hands with soap in the day: after washing (Urination, urination) after cleaning the child's hips (changing diapers), before meal and after handling food before and after raw meat, fish or raw poultry.
To prevent the spread of disease, washing your hands should also be used in the right way: dealing with cutting or after a cut or after sneezing, cough or wiping nose; after touching animal poop or treating animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries / regions, the rate of washing hands with soap is low.
A 2015 study on hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7 % of households use soap-washing habits. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest percentage of 97 percent, with the United States approaching the average, i.e. 77 percent, and China's lowest rate of 23 %. Now, multiple behavioural change methods are being implemented to advocate for washing hands with soap at critical moments. In order to develop a hand washing habit for children, developing countries have the option of having children in school to wash their hands every day.
The Basic Health care program introduced by the Philippine Department of education is an example of a massive initiative to improve children's health and education.
At the heart of the national plan is deworm twice a year, accompanied by washing hands with soap and brushing teeth with Fluoride-containing toothpaste.
In Indonesia, the plan has also been successfully implemented.
Blending with soap or cleaner in water can better remove microbes from the skin.
The main function of soap and cleaners is to reduce dissolve obstacles and improve solubility.
Using water alone doesn't effectively clean skin because fat and protein (part of organic soil) are not easily dissolve in water.
But cleaning hands requires reasonable use of water......
Solid Soap, as it can be reused, may preserve bacteria left behind when it was used before.
A small amount of studies surveyed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap, concluded that bacteria cannot be transferred because bacteria can be washed away by foam.
But the CDC still claims "the best choice of non-contact liquid soap".
Antibacterial Soap has been widely promoted among the health conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic resistant microbes in nature has been chosen using recommended antibacterial or disinfectants.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as trichlorosa, which has a large number of drug resistant microbiotics.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soap is not chosen for antibiotic resistant strains, antibacterial soap may not be as effective as propaganda.
In addition to surfactants and skincare agents, complex formulations may also contain acid (Acetate, anti-bad blood acid, Lactic Acid), antibacterial active benzoic acid, and more skin conditioners (Aloe Vera, vitamins, Peppermint, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the university of public health at the university of Oregon shows that ordinary soap has the same effect as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing trichlorosa in preventing disease and clearing bacteria.
Hot water washing your hands is comfortable, but its heat isn't enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria breed quickly at body temperature (37Â°C).
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water in removing natural grease containing soil and bacteria.
Scientific research has confirmed that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbiome on hand, contrary to the common view.
Water-free hand wash or sterilized hand wash is a non-Water Base Hand Cleanser.
In the late s and early s, non-Water-based alcohol hand cleaners (also known as alcohol rubbing liquid, free hand wash-free hand wash or hand wash) was popular.
Most of this type of hand washing detergent contains isopropyll or ethanol, then add thickers such as kapom (acrylic polymer) to form gel, or add moisturizing agents such as glycerine to form Liquid, or foam so easy use and relieve dry skin caused by alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide could further increase antibacterial activity. Free hand wash that contains at least 60 to 95 % alcohol can effectively sterilize.
Alcohol rubbing hand fluid can kill bacteria, Multi-Drug-resistant bacteria (Methylin Staphylococcus (MRSA) and anti-vancomycin enteria), TB and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syndrome) viruses (RSV), nasal virus, acne, flu and hepatitis) and fungus.
After 70 % alcohol rubbing liquid used for 30 seconds, it can kill 99.97 % of bacteria in your hand (reduced by 3.5 orders of magnitude, similar to a reduction of 35 DB), rubbing hands bacteria can be reduced by 99.99 % to 99.999 % (4 TO 5 orders of magnitude) in your hands in 1 minutes. Free hand washing detergent is the most effective for bacteria, while for some viruses it works slightly less.
Alcohol rubbing hand fluid has almost no effect on virus (Norovirus, also known as Novak, Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It must be used enough non-sterilized hand washing detergent or alcohol to completely moist or cover both hands.
Scrub the palm and back of your hand, as well as between fingers and all fingers for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam or gel dried.
Fingertips must also be fully cleaned, scrub the fingertips on both palms. The CDC suggests it's best to wash your hands than using free hand rub, especially when it looks dirty.
Since such hand rubbing fluids are easy to use and can quickly inactive microbiome, they are increasingly being used; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless there is no soap and water available.
Frequent use of alcohol free hand washing can cause dry skin unless a moisturizer and / or moisturizer is added to the formula.
Glycerin and / or other skin moisturizer can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate dryness caused by alcohol.
In Clinical Trials, alcohol free hand washing with Skin Moisturizer can significantly reduce skin irritation and dryness than soap or antibacterial cleanser.
Allergic exposure to skin inflammation, contact hives syndrome or allergies to additives in alcohol or alcohol rubbing liquid is rare.
One reason why alcohol free hand washing is less likely to induce stimulating sexual contact dermatitis than washing hands with soap and water.
The Water Cleaner, while effective, does not remove organic matter from hand, just sterilize it.
Therefore, free hand washing fluid is less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as soap and water, as these pathogens are still in hand.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol free hand washing determines depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, which has historically been much worse than alcohol and alcohol rubbing.
Recently, formulations using benzaza ammonium chloride has been proven to have sustained, cumulative anti-bacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been confirmed to be reduced after reuse, possibly due to gradual cause bad skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap and can use grass ash or soil instead.
Grass Gray or soil is better than washing hands alone, but not as soap.
One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated with microbiome, it may accelerate the spread of disease rather than slowing it.
Like Soap, grass ash is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it meets water.
Who suggests that if there is no soap available, you can replace soap with grass ash or sand.
The CDC suggests the right hand washing steps to prevent the spread of disease:
Wet your hands with flowing warm water or cold water.
Running water is recommended because vertical basins may be contaminated, and the water temperature doesn't seem to matter much.
Scrub repeatedly with enough soap to produce foam while cleaning the back, fingers and nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, research shows that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap rather than water alone.
Scrub at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove bacteria from the skin, the longer you scrub, the more bacteria remove.
Wash fully with flowing water.
Washing hands with a water basin can cause recontamination.
Dry or dry naturally with clean towels.
Moist hands are easier to be recontaminated. Thumbs, wrist, fingers and nail seams are the most frequently overlooked parts.
Artificial Nails and cracked nail polish may hide microbes.
Moisturizing Lotion is usually recommended to avoid hand drying; dry skin can cause skin damage, thus increasing the risk of infection transmission.
Where tap water and / or soap is not available in developing countries, a variety of low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, such as pourd water through a hanging barrel or pourd, and / or using grass Ash (if necessary)). Water-saving hand washing programs, such as easy taps and other low-cost ways can be used when water supply is limited water supply (for example, schools or rural areas in developing countries).
The technique of easy faucet is simple, hang a water tank with rope, then pouring a small amount of water to your hand through a pedal, then using soap.
Wiping your hands effectively is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there's still some controversy about the most effective way to dry hands in public bathroom.
More and more research shows that tissues are healthier than electric dry phones offered by many toilets.
In 2008, Westminster University of London conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the paper towel industry, on paper towels, warm-style dry phones and more modern jet dry phones comparisons in terms of hygiene.
After washing your hands with warm wind drying your hands, the total amount of bacteria on fingers increased by an average of 194 % and the total amount of bacteria on the pal
And with jet dry mobile phone, the total amount of bacteria on fingers increased by an average of 42 % and the total bacteria on the palm
Wipe your hands after washing tissues, the total amount of bacteria on fingers declined by an average of 76 percent, and the total amount of palm bacteria decrease of 77 percent. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether various dry hands may cause bathroom users and toilet facilities have cross infection.
Jet dry phones allegedly spray air at 180 meters / s (650 mph; 400 mph; 400 mph), capable of blowing away microbes on hand and on the plane, thus potentially contaminating 2 other bathroom users and toilet facilities within meters.
Using warm wind dry phones to spread microbes 0.25 meters away from dry phones.
Results from using tissue dry hands suggest there is no serious microbiome spread. In 2005, tÃ¼v produckt und umwelt conducted a study that assesses different ways of dry hands.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after dry hands:
The study involves many different dry phone manufacturers, comparing these dry phones with paper towels.
During Travel, you can choose to wash your hands with hand sterilized wet towels without soap and water.
Alcohol free hand washing detergent should be at least 60 %.
Hungarian doctor ignaz semmelweis discovered in 1846 that washing could effectively prevent the spread of diseases in hospitals, however, it was forced to require medical staff to wash their hands.
Hospitals use electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found a decrease in infection rates after using these devices.
Medical staff wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using a sufficient amount of soap and water or gel to generate foam and scrub all parts of the hand.
Hands and fingers are rubbing each other.
If there is residue between the nail seams, you can be cleared with a hard brush.
Since the remaining moisture on hand may still have bacteria, it is necessary to be fully cleaned and clean towels.
After wiping, tissue should be used to close the taps (use tissue to open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents hand from contamination with these surfaces again.
At Medical and health facilities, hand washing aims to Eliminate Pathogen Microbiome ("bacteria") and avoid spreading.
Reports from the new England medical journal show that in most medical environments, there are still not reaching an acceptable level of hand washing, with a large number of healthcare workers often forget to wash their hands before they contact with patients, leading to the spread of microbes.
A study suggests that proper hand washing, along with other simple procedures, can reduce catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health organization has released a worksheet that gives standard hand washing and rubbing methods in medical institutions demonstration.
The organization also published draft hand hygiene guidelines on its website for public opinion.
Whitby and others made a review.
If compliance is needed to be confirmed, commercial equipment can be measured and validated by rival health.
The "five moments" recommended by the world health organization to wash hands:
After contact with blood / body
Before Sterile Operation
After taking care of the patient. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap (" Soap " or " Antibacterial Soap ") can make hand washing agents sterilize.
This sterilization may be required before surgery or in environments with a large number of antibiotic-resistant microbiotics. When "Scrub" hands for surgery, there must be a faucet that can be opened and closed without contact, chlorohexine or iodine, Sterile Towels used to wipe your hands after washing hands, Sterile Brush and cleaning other aseptic tools for nails seams.
All Jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands, forearm to elbow, usually wash 2 TO 6 minutes.
No long scrub (10 minutes).
When washing, you must prevent water on your forearm from returning to your hands.
After washing your hands, use sterile cloth to dry your hands and put on surgery clothes.
In order to reduce bacteria spread, it is better to wash your hands before and after contact with patients.
To control Staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it is found that the greatest benefits of cleaning your hands come from washing frequency of 20 percent, and the further benefits are extremely limited when the frequency of cleaning up to more than 35
Washing your hands with ordinary soap can lead to more than tripled the rate of bacterial infectious diseases spread to food compared to antibacterial soap. After comparing the use of alcohol rubbing your hands with antibacterial soap (30 seconds respectively), it was found that bacterial infections using alcohol rubbing liquid is 26 % lower than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol rubbing hand in reducing the H1n1 Influenza A (Hi1n1 Influenza A) virus and clostridium differential spores. Hand hygiene in medical facilities can be improved by training staff on how to wash their hands, increase the supply of alcohol rubbing fluid and giving written and oral reminders to employees.
Further research is needed on which intervention is most effective in various medical settings.
In developing countries, washing your hands with soap is considered an important tool for cost-effective physical health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities at home, schools and workplace makes universal hand washing a challenge.
For example, in most african rural areas, it is rare to have hand washing faucet near every private bathroom or public bathroom, even with cheap methods to build a hand washing table.
However, the low frequency of hand washing can also be caused by deep-rooted habits, not by a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating for hand washing with soap can affect policy making, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioural changes among residents.
To Be effective, monitoring and evaluation must be done.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing the proportion of hand washing in low-income countries (Lmics), while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of advocating for hand washing in schools is the "Samsung approach" introduced by UNICEF, among other hygiene requirements, encouraging schools to take simple, cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can rise from one star to top three stars.
Hand washing promotion could include building hand washing tables to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of hand washing activity is world hand washing day, which aims to try to achieve behavioural change. UNICEF has promoted the use of a hand washing emoji due to the 2019-20 Corona virus epidemic.
Few studies have looked at the relationship between the overall cost-benefits of hand washing and the avoidance of disability adjustment life (Daly) in developing countries.
However, reports suggest that advocating for hand washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation intervention.
The earliest to recognize the importance of hand washing for human health -- especially for those with weak bodies (such as newly born mothers in hospitals or wounded soldiers) were two hand hygiene in the mid-19th century pioneers in the field: Ignaz Semmelweis, a hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence, founder of modern nursing " Florence Nightingale).
At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by the stinky smell known as the poison.
Outbreaks of foodborne diseases and pathogenic infections in the s prompted the U.S. centers for disease control and prevention to advocate for hand hygiene, highlighting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the covid-19 epidemic in 2020 have increased awareness among many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
Germany, for example, "the right way to wash" posters will hang next to hand washing pools in public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets.
The Idiom "washing hands off" means that someone declares that he is not willing to be responsible for something or unwilling to participate in something.
It stems from the Bible Matthew, Pontius Pilate washed his hands after the decision to nail Jesus and later evolved into widespread idioms in some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs Macbeth began forced washing her hands for trying to clean imaginary stains, showing her guilt for the crimes she committed and encouraging her husband to commit.
Research shows that people who think or contemplate immoral behavior tend to wash their hands more often than others and often cherish hand washing facilities more.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands after envisioning immoral behavior are unlikely to engage in other "purifying" compensatory actions such as volunteering.
Religion calls for sanitary and symbolic purposes. Symbolic washing hands with water but without soap is part of many religious iconic hand washing, including Baha ' I faith, Hindu, Judaism and netilat yadayim puristianity gifts and little purity in Islam. Religion also has hand-washing regulations for hygiene, especially after certain behaviors.
Hindu, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after toilet.
Hindu, Buddhism, Sikh, Judaism and Islam require hand wash before and after meal.
The outbreak of 2019 Covid-2 (Covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Cov-2 has so far infected 80,000 in China and other parts of the world. Many people, killing more than 3,000 people, causing huge human disaster.
Similar to homogeneous virus SARS-Cov, which caused thousands of people infected sars in 2003, SARS-Cov-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
While Covid-19 is lower in gravity and mortality than sars, it is more spread, with more elderly people than young and more males than women.
In view of the rapid increase in new crown pneumonia-related publications, this article would like to give a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly growing research topic.
We will introduce basic knowledge about epidemiology, etiology, viral, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this synthesis will help understand and eradicate this horrific disease.
The Spring Festival on December 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and memorable memory of the Chinese people, and the outbreak of a new viral disease forced everyone to stay out of their homes throughout the holidays and weeks.
The virus is highly homogenic with the cov that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, the world health organization (who) will put it on December 11, 2020 named SARS-Cov-2, the related disease is known as corovirus disease-19 (Covid-19).
The epidemic began in wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and then spread to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
As of December 2, 2020, the virus has led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of covid-19, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 dead.
Who warned that covid-19 has become the " no. 19 public enemy and its threat may surpass terrorism.
According to pubmed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), there are less than two months since the first reported isolation of virus sequences from multiple patients on January 7, 2020 several papers on covid-19 have been published on virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment.
This article aims to summarize research progress in this emerging subject area.
It is used to compare Covid-19 to sars and another cov-induced disease, Middle East Breathing Syndrome (Mers, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far on prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some urgent issues that remain to be addressed.
Cov used to be a non-Lethal pathogen in humans, causing about 15 % of common cold 4.
But this century has encountered two highly pathogenic human cov, SARS-Cov and mers-Cov, which erupted in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, spreading quickly many other countries have terrible prevalence and mortality rates.
Therefore, the covid-19 outbreak is the third cov outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in figure 1,1, wuhan city first reported several unknown cases of pneumonia to the Chinese National Health Council on December 31, 2019
Seven days later, the cov sequence was released.
Wuhan reported its first death case on December 15, 2020
Meanwhile, the epidemic is rapidly spreading to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
Infections were reported on December 20, suggesting that there may be a human-to-person phenomenon.
Wuhan City closed the city and closed all public transport on December 23
The first clinical study on new crown pneumonia on December 24, only 21 out of 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the South China seafood market in wuhan, which is believed to be the starting point of infection from unknown animal origin.
On January 30, who declared the outbreak a "Global Health emergency".
By the time of release of this report, the disease has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the globe (Figure 2 (Fig). 2)).
Due to the rapid growth of the epidemic, the ultimate scope and extent of the outbreak have yet to be determined.
A Multi-centric study for 8,866 patients (including 4,021 diagnosed covid-19 patients) provided an updated explanation of the epidemic as follows shown (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
Sars-Cov-2 can infect all ages, but the main age group is 30-65
Almost half (47.7 %) of those infected are over 50 years old, very few under 20 and only 14 infected are under 10
Sars-Cov-2 infected more males (0.31/10 million) than women (0.27/10 million).
Covid-19 mainly gathered for sexual transmission in and around hubei.
Covid-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from illness to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The Basic Regeneration Number (R0) is 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted r0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people has increased exponentially by January 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass migration in China before the Chinese new year.
The death rate of diagnosed cases is 1.44 % (95 % CI: 1.10-1.86 %) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients is 3.06 % (95 % CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three major risk factors for covid-19 are gender (male), age (+ 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
Cov is a large mask virus subfamily containing single justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genus, i.e. a, beta, Gamma and Delta, where Alpha-Cov and beta-Cov are known to be infected with humans.
Sars-Cov and mers-Cov-Cov combined with cell receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ace2) and Dipeptide Enzyme 4 (dpp4) and then membrane fusion pm
The viral rna genome is released into cytoplasm; after the viral genome is copied, genomic rna together with mask protein, together with encapsule protein and nuclear coat protein, then fusion with the mass membrane and release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-Cov-2 was reported on January 10, 2020
It was found that SARS-Cov-2 is a new type of beta-Cov, with genetic consistency over 99.98 % of 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China seafood market in wuhan city, the original outbreak.
Sars-Cov-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-Cov than mers-Cov.
Sars-Cov-2 particles have been discovered in ultra-thin slices of the popultra thin slices of the popultra.
Research found that human ace2 is the recipient of SARS-Cov-2 AND SARS-Cov.
However, SARS-Cov-2 has a weak bond between SARS-Cov-2 s protein and human ace2 compared to the fact that SARS-Cov-2 IS LESS SEVERE THAN SARS-Cov matching.
Sars-Cov-2 can also form new short protein coded by orf3b and secretion protein coded by orf8
The Orf3b OF SARS-Cov-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of ifn beta; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or base sequences.
On December 2, 2020, Zhou et al. Reported the structure of frozen electron microscopy (Cryo-em), which forms complex with amino acid transporter protein b0at1 with a resolution of 2.9 Ã¥s.
They found that the complex has open and closed conformations, assembled into a dimer, and the ace2-B0at1 Complex can combine two s proteins, thus providing evidence of cov recognition and infection.
B0at1 could be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress Sars-Cov-2 infections.
Origin and middle host
It is known that SARS-Cov and mers-Cov both originated from bat and spread to humans through beaver and camels, respectively.
Bat is believed to be the natural host of SARS-Cov-Cov-2 by comparison with other cov-2 BECAUSE THE NEW VIRUS IS COMPARING TWO SARS-like cov from the bat --. 96 % consistency for bat-SL-Covzx45 And Bat-SL-Covzx21 --
However, it is unclear what intermediate host helps the virus cross species barriers to infect humans, and its pathways of transmission also remains to be clarified.
Ji et al. Suggest snakes are carriers from bat to humans, which involves homologous recombinations within s protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe a cov found in pangzhou, a kind of long-kissed anteater, often used in Chinese medicine -- has 99 % of Cov-2 -- Gene Homology, therefore, is considered the potential intermediate host of SARS-Cov-2
However, the 1 % difference between the two genomes remains a huge difference; therefore, concrete evidence is yet to provide decisive results (Fig). 33).
The physical and chemical nature of SARS-Cov-2 remains largely unclear.
Sars-Cov and mers-Cov can survive in dry environments for 48 hours, with up to 5 days at 20Â°C and 40 % humidity.
Sars-Cov-2 may have a similar nature.
Sars-Cov-2 is reportedly sensitive to UV and thermal sensitivity -- 56Â°C 30 minutes; Ether, 75 % ethanol, Chlorine Disinfectant, peroethanic acid, chloroform and other fat solvent all can effectively inactive virus, but chlorine is not effective.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-Cov-2, and therefore are susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed study of the immune response to SARS-Cov-2
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other cov, especially sars-Cov and mers-Cov (Fig). 4). 4
Generally speaking, the virus is first recognized by the host's inherent immune system (PRR), including type c-like receptor, toll-like receptor (TLR), nod-like receptor (NLR)) and rig-I-like receptor (RLR.
Viruses Induce inflammatory factors expressed through different pathways, dentic cells maturity and synthesis of type I interferon (Ifn), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the giant phage of the virus antigen.
But Sars-Cov's n protein can help the virus get rid of immune responses.
Adaptive immune responses will soon join the fight against the virus.
T LYMPHOCYTES including cd4+ and cd8+ t cells play an important role in antivirus defense.
Cd4+ T cells stimulate b cells to produce viral specific antibodies, while cd8+ t cells directly kill cells infected by the virus.
Auxiliary T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help these defensive cells.
However, cov can inhibit t cell function by inducing t cell apoptosis.
Body Fluid immune including supplements such as c3a and c5a - and antibodies are also essential to fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies separated from recovered patients can neutralize mers-Cov.
On the other hand, excessive reaction of the immune system can produce large quantities of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, in the worst case, lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
Sars-Cov-2 infection, characterized by aggregate morbidity, are more likely to affect older people with multiple syndrome as well as pregnant women.
Often, individuals exposed to large numbers of viruses or impaired immune function are more likely to be infected than others.
According to a study of the first 425 cases in wuhan, the average incubation period for SARS-Cov-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, most of 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows an average incubation period of 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As previously mentioned, a recent study shows that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days, according to the demographics of 8,866 cases.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust effective segregation time based on the most accurate incubation period to prevent symptomatic infections from spreading the virus to others.
As usual, viral contacts or infected people usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the isolation be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and first symptoms of covid-19, which can be without any other symptoms, but can also be accompanied by dry cough, gas promotion, dizziness, dizziness, headache, headache, flux, chest pain, diarrhoea, nau waiting for symptoms.
Some patients suffered from breathing difficulties and / or hypoxia one week after illness.
Serious people will quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acids and blood coagulation dysfunction.
Even without lung imaging anomaly, patients with fever and / or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted late January 2019 shows the percentage of various symptoms: fever, dry cough 76 %, breathing difficulties 55 % and diarrhoea 3 %; 8 % of patients need ventilation support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies on family gatherhood and asymptomatic individual transmission.
By contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that mers-Cov patients also dominated fever (98 %), dry cough (47 %) and breathing difficulties (55 %).
However, 80 % of those patients need ventilation support, much more than covid-19 patients, coinciding with mers fatality higher than covid-19
Diarrhea (26 %) and pharyngeal pain (21 %) were also observed in mers patients.
Among Sars patients, fever (99 %- 100 %), dry cough (29 %- 75 %), difficulty breathing (40 %- 42 %), diarrhea (20-25 %) %) and pharyngeal pain (13 % (25 %) are the main symptoms, with about 14 to 20 % of patients need ventilation support.
As of January 14, 2 CONFIRMED COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 66,576, with a death rate of 2 %.
In contrast, sars had a mortality rate of 10 % in 8,096 confirmed cases as of January 2002
For Mers, according to a demographic study conducted in December 2012, the death rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37 %.
An early study reported that SARS-Cov-2 R0 is up to 6.47,95 % confidence interval (CI), while SARS-Cov's R0 IS ONLY 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 shows SARS-Cov-2 comparison with mers-Cov and Sara-Cov in terms of symptoms, mortality and r0
THE ABOVE DATA SHOWS THAT SARS-Cov-2 diffuse capability is higher than mers-COV AND SARS-Cov, but is less deadly than the latter.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic is more challenging than mers-COV AND SARS-Cov.
Aggregate diseases typically occur in the same family, or from the same gathering or transport, such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in wuhan or other outbreak areas in the last two weeks before the disease, or have a history of close contact with infected person or patients.
However, people are reportedly able to carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and healed patients discharged can carry the virus again, thus warnings of extending the isolation.
The number of blood white cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients early in the early stages of disease is normal or decreasing.
For example, leukocyte count 4 Ã 109 / L -- including lymphocyte count 1 Ã 109 / L -- was found in 1,099 patients disease, higher levels of amino transfer enzyme and viral blood.
Higher Levels of liver enzyme and muscle enzymes in the blood were seen in the blood, and most patients saw high blood c-reaction protein and blood sinking.
Blood fibrin degradation product d-Dimer levels and lymphocyte count is seen in heavy patients.
Most Covid-19 patients can see abnormal chest imaging, which is characterized by bilateral spots shadows or lung grinding glass shadow.
Patients usually suffer from atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards).
Uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and sexual fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange when ards occur.
Type I and type ii epithelial cell dysfunction can reduce surfactant levels and increase surface tension, thus reducing lung expansion capacity and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest imaging discoveries often coincide with the disease's worst.
Covid-18 first pathological analysis of covid-19 found alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, transparent membrane formation, and mesive lymphocyte infiltration and multi-nuclear cell cells, consistent with viral infections and the pathology of ards, and similar to sars and mers patients.
The detection of SARS-Cov-2 RNA through reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for diagnosing covid-19
However, since a higher false negative rate may accelerate the epidemic, China began using clinical manifestations for diagnosis (instead of relying solely on RT-PCR) on January 13
A similar situation happened when diagnosed sars.
Therefore, combining medical history, clinical performance, lab tests and imaging results is crucial for effective diagnosis.
On December 14, 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported a program to detect Sars-Cov-2 using crispr-based Sherlock technology, which does not require complicated instruments, using a test paper synthetic Sars-Cov detected in less than an hour with concentrations of 20 Ã 10-18 mol / l to 200 Mol / L (10-100 copies per microlitre)-2 RNA fragments.
If proven in clinical samples, this new technique is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.
Due to lack of experience in treating new cov, doctors mainly support treatment for covid-19 patients while trying to be used or proposed for other cov - such as SARS-Cov and mers-Cov - and other viral diseases various treatments (Table (table2). 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments such as antivirus, immunoinhibitors, steroids, blood plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support for recovered patients.
It is even recommended that the blood plasma of recovered patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
Sars-Cov-2 mainly attacked the lungs at the beginning, and may also attack other organs that express ace2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, breathing dysfunction and failure are major threats to patients and major causes of death.
Therefore, breathing support is crucial to relieving symptoms and saving lives, including regular oxygen inhalation, high flow oxygen inhalation, non-invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation, depending on the extent of
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive support from external membrane oxygen synthesis (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, Maintaining Electrolyte Balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and sepseptic shock and protecting critical organ functions are essential for SARS-Cov-2 patients.
It is known that overreaction of the immune system in sars and mers patients leads to cytokine storms.
Cytokine storms are a form of full body inflammation, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including tnf a, IL-1 Beta, IL-2, IL-6, ifn a, ifn beta, IFN GAMMA AND MCP-1.
These cytokines can induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, a major cause of ards and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppressive is crucial in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe illness.
Cortical steroids and tobeads single-an anti-Il6 Monoclonal Antibody - have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include: regulating t cell directional immune responses; blocking ifn-Gamma, IL-1 and tnf; inhibiting jak; bonatomitting; Cytokine Signal Transfer Inhibitor 4; and hdac inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as an immunosuppressor to treat sars to reduce inflammation damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not beneficial to severe lung injuries in sars and covid-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause severe side effects, especially ischemic bone necrosis, which seriously affect prognosis.
Nonetheless, short-range treatment is recommended for patients with critical covid-19 patients with cautious use of medium and low doses of corticovid-19
At the time of writing, effective antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, redsiway, a nuclear-a nuclear-like -- intravenous drug has been found to be effective for a covid-19 patient in the United States.
Redsiway is a new antivirus drug developed by gilid, originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola and marburg virus.
Later, it was also shown that redsiway may inhibit other single-chain rna viruses, including mers and sars viruses.
For these reasons, gilied has made the medicine available to China for two clinical trials for SARS-Cov-2 infected people with the results of which are expected.
In addition, Barrick Tini, Alpha-Interferon, lopinavi / litonavee and libaverin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Lopinawi / litonavi could be associated with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other negative reactions.
The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Blood Plasma And Antibody Generation of recovered patients
Patients recovering from infectious diseases has a long history of collecting blood for treating other patients suffering from the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from infection.
In fact, recovered patients typically contain relatively high levels of antibodies targeting pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (IG) produced by b lymphocytes used to combat pathogens and other foreign objects that identify unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this principle, blood was collected from the blood of a group of covid-19 patients who had recovered and injected to 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, while declining inflammation and viral load and increased blood oxygen saturation.
However, before specific treatments are developed, it is necessary to verify and clarified to propose methods that can be used on a massive scale.
Also, given the therapeutic effect, some of the shortcomings related to blood plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a toxic reaction that can be life -
Antibody Concentrations in the blood are usually lower, while there is a high demand for treatment of critical patients.
It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, a more critical and practical way is to separate b cells from the body of a recovered patient and identify genetic codes for effective antibodies, or screening effective antibodies against the protein necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily expand the production of antibody.
In China, TCM has been used to treat multiple diseases for thousands of years.
However, its therapeutic effect depends heavily on the combination of multiple ingredients in the prescription, which vary according to TCM theory of disease diagnosis.
Most active ingredients are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for covid-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe illness.
For example, the wind detoxification capsules and concoction capsules have been found to be effective for covid-19 treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87 % of patients use TCM treatment, among which the highest healing rates of covid-19 patients were observed, including gansu (63.7 %), Ningxia (50 %) and Hunan (50 %) while hubei province uses TCM treatment in only about 30 % of covid-19 patients with the lowest healing rate (13 %).
However, this is just a rough comparison, as many other influential factors such as the number and gravity of patients should be included in the assessment.
On December 18, 2020, Zhang Bury and his colleagues released a study comparing western medicine (WM) treatment alone treatment with wm and TCM.
They found that the time needed to recover, symptoms disappear and hospitalization in the wm+tcm group was significantly shorter than the simple wm group.
Most impressive, the symptoms deterioration rate of the wm+tcm group (from light to heavy) is significantly lower than the simple wm group (7.4 % to 46.2 %) and the death rate of wm+tcm group is also lower than the simple wm group (8.8 % vs 39 %).
Nonetheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still requires higher quality control tests, larger scale and more centers to be confirmed.
Characterizing the mechanism of TCM treatment or its combination and, where possible, explaining its effective ingredients will also be of concern.
Most patients suspected or diagnosed with covid-19 tend to be extremely fears of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those who are isolated feel bored, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse reactions such as insomnia caused by lesteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.
A series of psychological responses were reported in the early stages of sars outbreak, including ongoing depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental motor excitement, psychiatric symptoms, delirium and
As part of the public health response to the covid-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracking and segregation will increase anxiety and guilt about the effects of infection, segregation and stigma on their families and friends.
Mental Health care should therefore be provided to covid-19 patients, suspected cases, close contact and the public in need.
Mental support should include building multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication through regular and accurate updates on SARS-Cov-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and avoiding close contact using professional electronic devices and apps.
Effective vaccines are crucial to disruption of transmission chains from animal hosts and infected patients to vulnerable host, and often serve as a complement to antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has worked to develop vaccines based on s protein to produce long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and / or protective immune against SARS-Cov.
The live vaccine has been evaluated in sars animal models.
However, before the clinical study was launched, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the elderly and deadly assault models and their protective effect on common toxic infections in humans and animals had not been identified.
This is probably because sars disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
By contrast, due to the continuing common source of human and livestock disease in the epidemic areas, there are sporadic cases and aggregate cases of mers in the middle east and spread to other regions.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for mers, some of which have been evaluated in animal models, some of which have been evaluated in animal models, through the use of inactive virus, viral carrier, Nano Particles, viral particles, and recombinations.
Developing safe and effective vaccine against SARS-Cov-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time needed for vaccine development (average of 18 months) and dynamic changes in cov.
As a new type of disease, Covid-19 has just begun to show its full clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, similar to sars and mers, Covid-19 patients also have high prevalence and mortality rates.
Therefore, building prognosis models for the disease is crucial for health care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect prognosis of covid-19 patients (Table (table33):
Age: age is the most important factor influencing sars prognosis, as well as for covid-19
As previously mentioned, in a study that includes 8,866 cases, Covid-19 mainly occurred in the 30-65 age group, with 47.7 % of patients over 50 years old.
Patients in need of critical care are more likely to have basic syndrome and complications and are significantly older than those who do not need serious care (median age 66 to 51 years), suggesting the age is covid-19 a prognosis factor in patient's outcome.
Gender: as previously mentioned, more men are infected with SARS-Cov-2 than women (0.31/10 million against 0.27/10 million).
Syndrome and complications: Covid-19 patients who need serious care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart Events are also the leading cause of death in sars patients.
Sars-Cov-2 can also be combined with ace2 positive bile duct cells, which could lead to liver abnormal in covid-19 patients.
It is noteworthy that age is closely related to basic diseases and may affect each other.
Lab results are abnormal: the c-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflects the extent of inflammation or tissue damage, and is seen as a potential prognosis factor for disease, therapeutic response and eventual recovery
The correlation between crp levels and the gravity and prognosis of covid-19 was also raised.
In addition, the rise of Lactic Dehydrogenase (Ldh), Amino Transfer Enzyme (AST), Acine Amino Transfer Enzyme (Alt) and muscle acid kinase (ck) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue injury.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major Clinical Symptoms: chest imaging and clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues to predict the outcome and complications of covid-19
Steroids Use: as previously mentioned, steroids are immunoinhibitors, often used as an auxiliary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the extent of inflammation damage.
As high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in heavy sars patients, many survivors suffer from ischemic bone necrosis, leading to lifetime disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used in small doses and short time in covid-19 patients.
Mental Stress: as previously mentioned, many patients were under great pressure during the covid-19 outbreak because they often suffer from chronic isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the deaths of relatives and sick friends.
Psychological counseling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get rid of stress and get back to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological features of covid-19 appear to differ from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-Cov-2 can also be effectively replicated in upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or asymptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other cov that cause common cold
Therefore, infected people can produce a large number of viruses during the early or incubation period during daily activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-Cov spread is believed to occur during severe condition, and most of the spread does not occur at the early stages.
Thus, the current covid-19 outbreak is more severe and uncontrollable than sars.
China is currently making great efforts, including blocking wuhan and surrounding cities, and continuing segregation of almost all its population, with a view to interrupting the spread of SARS-Cov-2
While these measures have caused severe damage to China's economy and other areas, the number of new cases is declining, suggesting that the epidemic is slowing.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in January and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimate that covid-19 is significantly more contagious than sars and will not end in 2020
Ira Longini and others have built models to predict the consequences of the epidemic, BELIEVING SARS-Cov-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
A TEAM IN CANADA REPORTS THAT SARS-Cov-2 was detected in middle nasal and Swabs-2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a similar type cyclical epidemics from flu.
However, as the number of new cases decreases, China has shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.
Ebola has been predicted to cause 1000 million cases and 500 million deaths.
However, through strict isolation, the disease is finally under control.
Similar to SARS-Cov, SARS-Cov-2 Contagion could weaken, eventually disappear or become less pathogenic viruses coexist with the human body.
Below is a comparison of the covid-19 outbreak with sars and mers (Fig). 55).
Sars-Cov-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted through cough or sneezing, or even by direct contact with items contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in the poop, increasing the likelihood of spreading.
A recent study that includes 138 cases, 41 % of cases may be caused by intra-hospital infections, including 17 previously suffering from other diseases and 40 medical staff.
Therefore, tighter precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially paramedics, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have been in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 Dust Masks (1860 S Series) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent droplets from potentially infected people from spreading in the air or adhesive to the surface of items that may be passed to others.
However, only n95(1860 S Series) Masks Prevent inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 NM, with only 5 % of the viruses can penetrate fully; SARS-Cov-2 the size is similar to SARS-Cov, all around 85 NM.
Since viral particles can even penetrate five stack surgical masks, paramedics directly contact with patients must wear n95(1860 S Series) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, paramedics should also wear isolation clothes to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-Cov-2 while wearing a n95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, paramedics should also wear transparent masks or goggles when facing patients.
For the public in areas affected or potentially affected by the outbreak, it is strongly recommended that all people use sterilized soap more frequently than usual, stay indoor self-isolated and limit exposure to potential infected people.
Three Feet is thought to be the right distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
While Sars-Cov-2 is breaking into the human world as a new virus, based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS OUTBREAK, reported on January 7, 2020-Cov's high homology should have raised China's heightened alert.
However, until December 19, 2020, the director of the wuhan city center for disease prevention and control was still appealing the public, saying that the new virus is not contagious, the possibility of human to-to-to-to-to-person, and that the outbreak is control.
The news apparently relaxed public vigilance, and the Chinese new year is approaching, which is missing out on the key point in wuhan.
China's disease control agencies could learn this painful lesson and make major improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in issuing announcements because every word is crucial to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive to abnormal information from hospitals instead of waiting for official reports from doctors or officials ;(3) tighter control of potential outbreaks at the early stages rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) conduct more frequently targeted and effective drills to improve public awareness epidemics awareness and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The Covid-19 outbreak, caused by the new virus SARS-Cov-2 began in late January 2019
At the time of writing, it has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the globe in less than two months.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-Cov and symptoms between covid-19 and sars, the covid-19 outbreak looks like sars recurrence.
However, there are some notable differences between covid-19 and sars, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
Covid-19 affects more older people than young, more males than women, and older patients are more severe and mortality rates than younger ones.
Sars has a higher mortality rate than covid-19 (10.91 % against 1.44 %).
Even without symptoms, Covid-19 patients still spread the virus, while sars patients usually spread the virus when they are serious condition, making controlling covid-19 spread far more difficult than sars.
This part explains why sars-Cov-2 spread far faster and widely than SARS-Cov.
In some covid-19 patients, regular RNA TESTS FOR SARS-Cov-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, healed patients may turn to the sun again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Considering the research on covid-19 is so fast, the following key issues remain to be addressed:
WHERE DID SARS-Cov-2 come from?
Despite 96 % genetic homology found between SARS-Cov-2 and two bat-like cov, we still cannot draw the conclusion that SARS-Cov-2 comes from the bat.
What animal is spreading the virus from the original host -- presumably bat -- to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 AND 2, we can't effectively cut the transmission pathways and the outbreak could resurgence anytime.
While molecular models and biochemical analysis have proven that SARS-Cov-2 combines with ace2, how does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also combine cells that express ace2 in other organs?
Without Clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the outbreak last?
How did viruses evolve during human-to-person?
Will it become a global pandemic? DISAPPEAR LIKE SARS? Or will it recurve regularly like flu?
Finding answers to the above and many other questions is crucial, but it may take longer.
However, regardless of the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic and get our lives back to normal as soon as possible.
The b ' a covid-19 vaccine is the imaginary vaccine for 2019 Corona Disease (Covid-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, multiple attempts to develop the vaccine are still underway.
In late January 2, the world health organization (who) said that no vaccine against SARS-Cov-2 is expected within 18 months.
Five Candidate vaccines entered phase I safety studies in January.
Covid-19. was discovered in January 2019
In 2020, a mass epidemic spread globally, sparking massive investment and research activities in vaccines.
Many organizations are using the released viral genome to develop possible SARS-Cov-2 vaccines.
Cepi presented a vaccine development plan in December, saying speed, production capacity, mass deployment and global availability.
Scientists at cepi reported that early 2020 different technical platforms were researching and developing effective Covid-19 vaccines in early 4
Main platform targets for entering phase I safety research include:
Nuclear Acid (DNA AND RNA) (stage I developers and candidate vaccines: Modern, Mrna-1273)
Viral Carrier (stage I developer and candidate vaccine: Cansino Biologics, type 5 Adenovirus carrier)
Cepi scientists reported in January that a total of 115 candidate vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them identified as ongoing projects (79 according to milken institute data), 37 more have been announced, but almost no public information (presumably planned or designed).
The I-II trial conducted initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, Placebo-point tests, while identifying more precise and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing disease while monitoring the adverse reaction at the best doses.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (confirmed as of early January 4), 74 have not been evaluated (still in "Preclinical" research).
Around December 24, 2020, the university of Queensland, Australia announced that it is studying the potential of a molecular plier vaccine that can genetically modify viral protein to stimulate immune response.

Developing and producing vaccines.
The two agencies further announced plans to conduct pre-clinical trials and stage I clinical trials by January 2020
On December 3, 2020, the Indian Ministry of health announced that 11 separate strains were being studied, even if accelerated, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop vaccines.
Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that viral partially funded by the Canadian institutes of health, 2020
The candidate vaccine is being studied in lab, and it is scheduled to enter human trials in January or January 2020
Earlier this week, the guardian reported that U.S. President Donald J. Trump has offered curevac " a 'large amount of money' to get exclusive access to covid-19 vaccines,[the German government protest against this.
On December 17, 2020, U.S. Pharmaceutical Company Pfizer announced a collaboration with German company biontech to develop a vaccine based on mrna.
Mrna-based vaccine bnt162 is currently in pre-clinical testing phase and is expected to begin in January 2020
Italian biotechnology company takis biotech announced on December 17 that it will receive pre-clinical test results in January 2020, its final candidate vaccine could begin in the fall test.
In France on December 2020, 3, the alliance for epidemics prevention innovation (Cepi) announced an investment of $ 4900 million for the establishment of a bastard institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) the covid-19 vaccine research alliance with the university of Pittsburgh, bringing cepi's total investment in covid-19 vaccine development to $ 29000 million.
Cepi's other investment partners in covid-19 vaccine development include modern, curevac, inovio, novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the university of Queensland.
On December 3, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal tests on 6 different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial Institute of technology London announced on December 20, 2020 that it was developing a self-Augmented RNA VACCINE FOR COVID-19
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days after receiving a sequence of the virus released in China.
In late January, the Canadian government announced a funding of $ 275 billion to fund 96 medical countermeasures research projects aimed at covid-19, including a number of candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as medicago and university of Saskatchewan plan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced that $ 192 billion will be dedicated to the development of covid-19 vaccines and plans to build a national "vaccine bank" including several new vaccines, in order to re-emerge the corona outbreak when you can put these vaccines into use.
Researchers at the university of Pittsburgh school of medicine reported testing of pittcovacc, a covid-19 vaccine that could be used in mice, 2020, calling "provided by MNA SARS-Cov-2 S1 subunit vaccine can give [ Mice ] a strong antigen-specific antigen-specific antibody reaction that begins 2 weeks after immunization".
On December 16, 2020, the university of Waterloo Canada announced the design of a dna-based candidate vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
Researchers used bacteria to design dna as replicating inside human bacteria to produce harmless viral particles, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 virus.
In December 2020, the U.S. Government, industry and three universities gathered resources and combine cloud computing resources from HP, Amazon, Microsoft and google to access ibm's supercomputers.
Some vaccines have heterogenic effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means they have other benefits than preventing disease.
Further random trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or ineffective.
Early research to evaluate vaccine effectiveness with covid-19 specific animal models such as ace2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates, suggests that biosafety level 3 is needed to be taken to deal with live viruses curb measures and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized security procedures.
Vaccines for sars and mers have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there were no safe and effective sars treatment or preventative vaccines for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new types of vaccines and drugs used to treat sars is a priority for governments and public health institutions worldwide. In addition, there are currently no effective vaccine for mers.
During the mers epidemic, it was thought that existing sars research could provide useful templates for developing vaccines and treatments for mers-Cov infections.
As of December 2020, one (DNA-based) Mers vaccine had completed stage I human clinical trial, and three more vaccines are under development, all of them viral vectors, both of them adenovirus carrier vaccine (Chadox1-Mers, Bvrs-Gamvac), a MVA CARRIER VACCINE (MVA-Mers-s).
Various social media articles have fuelled conspiracy theories, claiming the virus behind covid-19 has been found and vaccines are available.
Patents quoted in various social media articles refer to the gene sequences of other corona viruses (such as sars corovirus) and patents for vaccines.
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, ace2 is an enzyme attached to the extracellular surface (cell membrane) in lungs, artery, heart, kidney and intestinal tract.
Ace2 is expected to be the drug target for treating cardiovascular disease by reducing angiotensin ii and increasing ang (1-7) content. Ace2 is also the entrance point for certain corona viruses into cells.
The Human Source Version of this enzyme is commonly known as hace2.
Angiotenin Converting Enzinc-2 is a zinc metal enzinc-containing enzyme located on the surface of endo
Ace2 protein consists of an n-End Peptide Enzyme M2 domain and a c-End Collectrin Kidney Amino Acid Transporter Protein Domain.
Ace2 is a single-pass I membrane protein whose enzyme active domain is exposed to cell surfaces of lungs and other tissue.
Another enzyme known as sheddase (Sheddase) breaks ace2's extracellular domain from the transmembrane domain, releasing soluble protein into the blood and eventually excretion to urine.
Ace2 exists in most organs: ace2 is attached to cell membrane, mainly lung type ii lung, intestinal epithelial cells, arteries and vein endothelial cells of most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
Ace2 Mrna expressions were also found in cerebral cortex, tattoms, lower thalamus and brain stem.
Ace2's main function is to check and balance ace.
Ace cracks angiotenin I into vascular tension ii with vascular contraction activity.
Ace2 then cracks angiotensin II (ASP-Arg-Val-Tyr-His-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzed it into vascular tensin (1-7)), (H-ASP-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-oh).
Ace2 can also crack a number of other peptides, including DEARINE 9 Slow-induced peptides, Apelin (Apelin), neurodepressin, endorphine a and stomach starvation.
Ace2 also regulates membrane transport of neutral amino acids transporter protein slc6a19 and is associated with hartnup.
As a transmembrane protein, ace2 is the main entry point for certain corona viruses into cells, including hcov-nl63; SARS-Cov (the virus that leads to SARS); and SARS-Cov-Cov-2 (leading to covid-19 viral).
More specifically, s1 puncture protein from SARS-COV AND SARS-Cov2 Combine with the enzyme domain on the cell surface, leading to endotonation, bringing viruses and enzyme to the core inside the cells.
Such an entry process also requires host serine protease tmprss2 triggered s protein activation, and the inhibiting of the process is currently being studied as a potential cure. Some speculate that lower ace2 levels in cells may help combat infection.
However, multiple professional associations and regulators recommend the continued use of standard ace inhibitors and arb therapy.
A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis released on December 2012 found that " the use of ace inhibitors can significantly lower the risk of pneumonia by 34 % compared to the control group %".
Moreover, " for patients with high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, using ace inhibitors can also reduce the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ace inhibitors is also linked to lower pneumonia-related mortality rates, but the results are less reliable as reliable as reducing
Recombinant Ace2 (rhace2) is considered a new method for treating acute lung injury, which appears to improve lung hemodynamics index and blood oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Rahace2 has a half-life in the human body of about 10 hours, with an effective time of 30 minutes and the action process (duration) is 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rahace2 may be a promising future for patients with the classic renin-Angiotensin System (Ras) inhibitors or a high circulation angiotensin ii level medicine. The Therapeutic effect of rhace2 infusion on acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated by clinical trials.
The 2019-2020 Corovirus outbreak is a 2019 new type of covid-19 (Covid-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
The outbreak was confirmed in wuhan, China on January 12, 2019, 2020 as a public health emergency of international concern, 3, 2020 the day was identified as an epidemic.
As of December 2020, 4, 1610 million covid-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and regions worldwide, killing about 97 million people,
Healed About 364 million people.
China has a disease death rate of about 4 percent, while disease deaths vary between 0.08 % (New Zealand) and 13.04 % (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and gas promotion.
It may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The incubation period from exposure to illness ranged from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.
There are currently no vaccines or special antiviral treatment.
Clinical Treatment is mainly supported by symptoms. Recommended precautions include hand washing, covering the mouth during cough, keeping safe distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspected people.
Official Agencies across countries have responded to travel restrictions, segregation, curfews, workplace hazard control and closure of facilities.
The outbreak has caused severe global socioeconomic shocks, with sporting, religious, political and cultural activities postponing or cancellation, while panic shopping has exacerbated widespread supply shortages.
193 countries and regions around the world have implemented national or local suspension measures, affecting about 99.4 % of primary and higher education students.
As fake viral information spreads online, there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other east and appearance groups of east and Southeast Asian Origin, as well as groups in regions with severe epidemic.
However, reduced travel and heavy industry closures have led to a decline in api and carbon emissions.
On December 2019, 12, the health department of Wuhan (Capital of hubei province) reported a batch of unknown cause pneumonia cases and opened an investigation in early January 2020
Most of these cases are related to South China's seafood wholesale market, so the new corovirus is believed to be a common human and animal
The virus that sparked the outbreak, known as SARS-Cov-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to the bat corona virus, PANGULAR VIRUS AND SARS-Cov. The earliest patient discovered was later confirmed to have a disease on December 1, 2019, with no apparent connection to the group of cases in South China's seafood market.
Two thirds of the early cases reported in January 2019 were confirmed to be linked to the South China seafood market.
On December 3, 2020, the South China morning post published an unconfirmed report saying the first case may date back to January 17, 2019, 11, the patient was 55-Year-old male, from hubei province. On December 26, 2020, according to the world health organization reported a decline in China, but new reported cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea suddenly increased, and new cases outside China for the first time, the number exceeded the territory.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially those of minor disorders.
As of December 26, relatively few cases were reported among teenagers, with only 2.4 % of teenagers aged 19 and under globally, Patrick Varan, UK Chief Scientific Advisor the UK needs about 60 % of its population infected with the new corovirus to get effective mass immunization.
The number of cases is the number of people who have been tested by Covid-19 and confirmed positive results according to the official program.
As of December 23, countries around the world accounted for less than 3 % of the total population, and many countries have issued official policies for non-detection of people with minor disorders, including Italy countries such as li, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
An estimated 86 % of covid-19 infected people in China are undetected and those undocumented infections, according to a study published on January 16 people are the source of infection in 79 % of recorded cases.
According to a statistic analysis released on January 30, the actual number of infections in Italy far exceeds the number of reported cases.
Covid-19 basic infections (R0) was originally estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4
A study published by the CDC suggests r0 could be 5.7.
Most Covid-19 patients can recover.
Patients who are unable to recover from illness to death is 6-41 days most common in 14 days.
As of January 4, 2020, about 97 million people have died from covid-19.
As of December 5, about 80 % of deaths in China were over 60 and 75 % of deaths accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official Statistics on covid-19 deaths usually refer to those who have positive results from new corovirus tests according to official programs.
The actual covid-19 death toll may be far more than the statistic, as the data may not include untested patients, such as those who died at home, nursing homes, etc.
Some data from Italy show that the actual death toll during the outbreak is 4-5 times the official number of new corovirus pneumonia deaths.
A CDC spokeswoman admits, " we know [the number of deaths] is lower than actual numbers :" and rumours of underrated U.S. data confirms this statement :" underestimation is common in epidemics, such as the H1n1 swine flu outbreak in 2009 on December 9, 2020, 1, China's first confirmed death case appeared in wuhan.
The first death case outside China appeared in the Philippines on December 1, and the first death outside Asia on January 14 was in France.
As of December 28, more than a dozen deaths occurred outside China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each.
As of December 13, more than 40 countries and regions had reported deaths in all continents other than Antarctica. There are several methods commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region and will vary over time, and be affected by demographic features such as age, quality of health systems, treatment, the first outbreak and general health status. The disease death rate is the result of the number of deaths over a given time period divided by the number of diagnosed people.
According to John Hopkins University Statistics, the global death rate was 6.0 % (97,039/1,617,204) as of January 10
Death rates vary from region to region.
In China, the estimated death rate of illness fell from 17.3 % (patients who fell from 1 to 10 to 0.7 % in January 1). Patients with illness after day). other measures also include case mortality (CFR) and infectious mortality (Ifr), which reflects the percentage of disease deaths as a percentage of diagnosed people diagnosed, which reflects the number of deaths from diseases (including diagnosed and undiagnosed) percentage.
These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process of specific populations from infection to case resolution.
Many scholars try to calculate the above data for specific populations.
The Overall death rate of infections ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 percent, according to Oxford's center for evidence-based medicine.
The estimated value cap for the range is consistent with Germany's first random test of covid-19, as well as a statistic analysis study on the effects of detection on cfr estimates.
The World Health organization says the outbreak is controllable.
The Peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University: " if unchecked, outbreaks of infectious diseases usually go into stagnation after existing hosts run out and then begin to ease :"
But at the moment, it's almost impossible for us to predict when the inflection will appear."
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, believes that if all countries mobilize to adopt the world health organization's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus, then "ending the epidemic can be expected".
Adam Kucharski from the London school of health and tropical medicine said SARS-Cov-2 " could be repeated outbreaks that lasts for one or two years."
A study led by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of technology shows that " before vaccines are put into use (it could take 18 months or more)," it is important to keep physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner from Vanderburg University: " this corona virus is highly spreading and I think it is unlikely to disappear completely," could turn into a seasonal disease that erupts once a year."
The Pathogenesis of a renewed outbreak depends on group immunity and mutation.
The symptoms of covid-19 are relatively non-specific and some infected people may be symptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 %) and dry cough (68 %).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory phlegm (phlegm), loss of smell, gas, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, giggle, diarrhoea or cyanosis. According to the world health organization, about one in six patients will turn into disorders and have breathing difficulties.
The CDC listed as emergency symptoms of breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden blurred consciousness, hard to wake up and hair on face or lips as emergency symptoms; if these symptoms, it is recommended for immediate treatment. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic and without any clinical manifestation, but the test results are positive, so researchers recommend close observations and screening of close contact with confirmed patients to exclude the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the rate of asymptomatic infections ranged from very low to 44 percent.
Incubation Period (time interval from infection to onset) is usually 1-14 days; 5 days are most common. with regard to uncertainty, it can be illustrated by one example: the proportion of patients who lost smell in covid-19 patients was originally estimated to 30 % and later dropped to 15 %.
Some details on the pathway the disease is transmitted.
The disease is currently believed to be transmitted mainly through close contact and foam produced by coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact refers to an interval of 1-2 meters (3-6 ft).
Research found that an unblocked cough could cause foam to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 ft)-8.2 M (15-27 ft).
It has also been suggested that the foam produced when people speak for a longer stay in the air could also lead to the spread of the virus. Although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air, people can also produce foam when they breathe or talk.
This foam may fall into the mouth and nose of people around them and even be sucked into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR could spray respiratory secretions and thus cause air transmission.
Also, if a person touches the virus-contaminated surface (including skin) and then touches his own eye, nose and mouth, it can cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through poop, but the risk is considered lower.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-Cov-2 dung mouth spread. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after it, but it is also contagious before and after illness.
Positive results can be detected as early as three days before the disease, suggesting that the new corovirus was contagious before visible symptoms.
Despite the rare number of cases diagnosed by the lab, some countries have detected symptomatic infections in the course of contact tracking investigations.
The European center for disease control (Ecdc) said that while the spread of the new corovirus is not entirely clear, the average of 1 PEOPLE CAN INFECT 2-3 people. The virus lives on the surface of the object ranged from hours to days.
Specifically, the new corovirus is known to survive on plastic (Polyacrylic) and 304 Stainless Steel for up to three days, surviving on cardboard for a day and up to four hours on copper.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature. There are currently positive cases of pets and other animals covid-19
There is currently no evidence that animals will re-infect the virus to humans, but official uk authorities suggest people wash their hands after exposure to animals, just like contact with surfaces that may be infected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a new virus that was first isolated from 3 pneumonia patients in wuhan.
All the features of this new sars-Cov-2 virus are present in nature's associated corona virus. The virus can be killed with home soap before it gets into the human body because soap can dissolve the protective cystic film of the virus. Sars-Cov-2 is closely related to the ORIGINAL SARS-Cov.
It is currently considered a common disease in humans and animals.
Genetic analysis shows that the corona virus is genetically cluster with becovirus subgenus subgenus (cluster b) and two bat-borne strains.
The new corovirus is consistent with other batcov ratg13 at the whole genome level %.
In December 2020, Chinese researchers found that the virus in the pangular body was only one amino acids in some parts of the genome sequence.
As of now, the whole genome comparison found that up to 92 % of the genetic material between the pangria and SARS-Cov-2 is not enough to prove that the pangerture is the middle host.
Whether or not the virus is infected can be initially diagnosed based on symptoms, but ultimately, it will still be diagnosed through reversible polymerase chain reaction (Rrrrrt-PCR) or ct imaging
A comparison study of pcr and ct in wuhan shows that ct is obviously more sensitive than pcr, but less specific, many imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and disease development processes.
As of December 2020, the American Radiation Society recommended that " ct is not suitable for screening Covid-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease."
The World Health organization has now unveiled several nuclear acid testing programs for SARS-Cov-2, the first one released on January 17
Nuclear acid detection uses real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (Rrrrt-PCR).
Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for detection.
Results can normally be made within hours to days.
Generally speaking, this test is done through nasopharyngeal swab and can also be done via swabbing. Many Labs and companies are developing serology tests to detect antibodies.
As of December 6, 2020, none of these testing methods have proven accurate enough to approve widespread use.
In The United States, serology tests developed by cellex have been approved for certified labs for emergency use only.
Typical imaging features of x-slices and computer tomography scanning (CT) in patients include asymmetrict and asymmetrict.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling an international online database for the image performance of diagnosed cases.
Due to overlap with other viral infections (such as adenovirus), unconfirmed images are limited in identifying covid-19
A large study in China compared chest ct results to pcr results, although images are less specific to identify infections, it is faster and more sensitive, so it can be considered as a screening tool in popular areas. PM
A Convolutional Neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed that combines x-slices and ct to detect images of the virus.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding directly touching the nose and mouth of the eye and mouth, covering your nose when coughing or sneezing, and used tissues directly into the trash can.
Suspected infected people should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.
Measures to keep physical distance are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have limited or suggested avoiding unnecessary commuting to countries and regions affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has now reached a community spread phase in much of the globe.
This means the virus is spreading within the community, and some community residents have no idea where they are or how they are infected. Paramedics who are in contact with suspected infections should take standard precautions, exposure to precautions and eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important tool for health regulators to identify sources of contagion and prevent further spread.
The Government's use of mobile phone positioning data for tracking purposes has sparked privacy concerns, with more than 100 groups such as amnesty international issued statements calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
There are currently various mobile apps that have been put into use or entered into proposals for people to use on a voluntary basis, and as of January 7, more than a dozen expert groups are working on exploring solutions with privacy protection features such as use Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other phones.
Users will receive a message reminder once they have close contact with positive patients with the covid-19 test results. False statements about prevention of infection continue to spread; such as washing nose and rinse with mouthwash are ineffective.
There is currently no covid-19 vaccine yet, but many organizations are actively developing.
It is recommended to stop the spread of the disease by washing your hands.
The CDC recommends people to wash their hands regularly with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there are visible dirt on their hands, before meal and after blowing, cough or sneezing.
This is because the virus can destroy its protective cystic film by using home soap before entering the human body.
The CDC also suggested that alcohol-containing hand washing detergent with at least 60 % alcohol content can be used if there is no soap and tap water around you.
The World Health organization advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
Object Surface can be sterilized with multiple solutions (sterilization solution can be effective within one minute), including 62-71 % ethanol, 50-100 % Isopropanol, 0.1 % sodium hypochlorate, 0.5 0.2-7.5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5 % Polyvione Iodine.
Other Solutions (such as benzachlorol and Chlorine Glucose) are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if new type of corovirus pneumonia cases or confirmed cases occur in facilities such as offices or daycare, disinfect all areas, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreen, keyboards, remote control and Atms used by patients, etc.
Who is recommending people to cover their nose with curved elbows or tissues when cough or sneezing, and dispose of all contaminated tissues immediately.
It is recommended that people suspected to wear medical surgical masks because wearing masks can reduce the amount of foam exhale when talking, sneezing and cough and shorten the spread distance.
The World Health organization has issued a note on the occasion and how to use masks.
"wearing masks can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is also a major source of infection when hand hygiene is also recommended to take care of suspected of infection". people wear masks.
The World Health organization recommends that healthy people should wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for taking care of covid-19 patients, but the organization also recognises that wearing masks helps avoid face touching.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
CDC suggests wearing non-medical masks made of cloth. China explicitly recommends healthy citizens to wear disposable medical masks, especially in close contact with others (1 M (3 FT)).
Hong Kong, China suggests wearing masks when travelling public transport or entering crowded places.
Thai health officials advise people to make masks and wash daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly forbidden from entering public places without masks or blocking mouth and nose.
On December 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks to enter public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government rules that masks are required for all entering the grocery store.
Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan has produced 1,0000 million masks per day since mid-December, China, and it is required to wear masks on trains and intercity buses since January 1
Panama has made it necessary to wear masks when going out, and suggests homemade masks for residents who cannot afford them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infection Prevention and control measures for maintaining social distance (also known as physical distance) are aimed at minimizing close contact between people and thus slowing the spread of disease.
Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension, suspension of work and closing stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
The measures that individuals can take in terms of maintaining social distance include staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding access to crowded areas, switching non-contact greeting and physical distance from others.
Now, many governments have mandatory or suggested social distance in areas affected by the epidemic.
On the largest mass concentration scale, U.S. government agencies and who initially suggested 250 people (in areas without covid-19 spread), then quickly reduced to 50 and later to 10 people.
On January 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and groups suffering from basic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and impairment of the immune system are at higher risk. The German CDC advised such people living in outbreak areas not to go out as possible. In late January 2020, the world health organization and other health agencies started replacing the phrase " keep social distance " with " keeping physical distance " to clarify the term " the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, including virtual and long-distance connections.
Using the phrase "keeping social distance" has the meaning of asking people to be completely segregated from society and does not encourage people to adopt other ways to keep people connected. Some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines that apply during the pandemic.
The recommendations include having sex only with partners who live together and are not infected with the virus or asymptoms.
Covid-19 diagnosed patients and suspected infected are advised to be self-isolated.
Health agencies have released details on proper self-segregation. Many governments have forced or advised all residents of the affected areas to isolate themselves.
Strongest Self-isolation instructions were also issued to high-risk populations.

Outbreak Prevention and control strategies include containment / inhibiting and relief.
Containment applies to the early stages of outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people while taking other infection prevention and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to other populations.
If the spread of disease is no longer possible, then work hard to transition to relief: take measures to slow the spread of disease and reduce the impact of disease on health systems and society.
Containment and relief measures can be carried out simultaneously.
Inhibiting requires more extreme anti-control measures to reverse the epidemic by reducing basic regeneration to below 1 part of the effort to curb infectious disease outbreaks is to work to reduce the peak of outbreak, known as we know to draw epidemiological curves.
This could reduce the risk of collapse of health services systems and buy more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-drug intervention that can control the epidemic include personal precautions such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-isolation; community measures aimed at keeping physical distance such as suspension and cancellation of mass rallies; aim to encourage acceptance and participation in such intervention community action; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.

Simulations For Britain and the United States show that both alleviating (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (reverse the spread of the epidemic) face major challenges.
Best Relief policies may cut peak medical demand by 2/3 and halve deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and cause health systems collapse.
Inhibitory may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus stops spreading among the population (or until vaccine is launched, first come first come), otherwise, the spread will rebounce quickly once relaxed.
Long-term intervention aimed at curbing the pandemic can have social and economic costs.

Covid-19 workplace prevention and control
Covid-19 workplace prevention and control is the prevention of corona disease 2019 (Covid-19).
The appropriateness of workplace hazard control depends on specific work site and work tasks and should be determined based on risk assessment of exposed sources, the extent of disease in the community and risk factors that may be exposed to covid-19
As required by the United States administration of career safety and health (OSHA), low-exposure jobs have the least professional exposure to the public and other colleagues, therefore recommend basic infections prevention measures, including hand washing to encourage employees to segregation after illness, abide by breathing etiquette and daily cleaning and sterilize the working environment.
Moderate exposure work includes jobs that require regular or close contact with unknown or suspected covid-19 patients who can be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
Including staff who reach out to the general public, such as schools, high-density working environments and some mass retail environments.
In addition to basic infection precautions, the group should also use efficient air filter and sneezing protectors for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment and other dangerous prevention measures in contact with covid-19 patients.
OSHA believes that medical and mortuary staff who are exposed to known or suspected covid-19 patients are at high exposure if the staff performed aerosol-producing operation on known or suspected covid-19 patients the risk of exposure becomes extremely high when specimens are collected or dealt with.
Dangerous Prevention and control measures for such personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.
The Covid-19 outbreak could have a serious impact in the workplace.
Staff members may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in demand for goods, or changes in access to these goods (such as shopping during off-peak hours or using delivery or free delivery services).
Finally, product logistics from covid-19 outbreak areas could be interrupted. Infectious disease prevention and response plans can be used to guide protection action.
These plans address levels of risk associated with various workplace and tasks, including exposure to sources, risk factors from family and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers such as elderly or groups suffering from chronic illness.
The plans also outlines the prevention and control measures needed to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise due to outbreaks.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to obey national or local advice.
The goals in response to outbreak include reducing the spread of workers, protecting people at high risk of bad health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response can be affected by the extent of disease in the communities where the business is located.
Hazard Prevention Level is a widely used prevention and control framework in career safety and health, which is used to group risk prevention and control measures based on effectiveness.
If the hazards of covid-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering control, followed by administrative control and finally personal protection equipment.
Engineering control means segregating employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on employee s' behavior, which is the least cost solution.
Administrative Control means changing work policies or procedures that require staff or employers to act on their own.
PPE's anti-control effect is less effective than engineering control and administrative controls, but helps prevent some exposure.
All types of ppe must be chosen according to the risk level facing staff, equipped according to the applicable circumstances (such as breathing apparatus) and must always be properly worn, regularly checked and maintained, replacements as necessary, and properly discharged, clean, store or treat to avoid pollution.
Low-exposure jobs have the least career exposure to the public and other colleagues, according to OSHA.
It is recommended that all workplace should take basic infection prevention measures, including washing their hands regularly, recommend that sick employees stay isolation, cough or sneezing, obey breathing etiquette, provide tissues and trash cans, be prepared for telecommute when necessary. Discouraging employees from using other s' tools and equipment, and keep the workplace clean and sterilized everyday.
Timely identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) suggests that employees who exhibiting acute respiratory symptoms should be separated for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there is no fever, fever, fever symptoms and any other symptoms, sick leave policies should be implemented family care for sick families and staff should be clearly informed of the policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure work involves frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected covid-19 patients within 6 Feet (1.8 m), but may cause individuals to ongoing communities near the workplace Sars-Cov-2 JOBS ARE SARS-2 due to possible recent visit to covid-19 epidemic areas.
Such staff include those working in schools, high population density working environments and some mass retail environments that will be exposed to the general public. Engineering controls aimed at this and high-risk groups include installing efficient air filter, improving ventilation, transparent plastic sneezing protectors and installation of physical barriers, and installing free windows to provide customer services. Administrative controls over this and high-risk groups include encouraging sick employees to segregation, replacing face-to face meetings with virtual communication, setting up a mispeak shift system, cancelling unnecessary travel to the covid-19 outbreak site, and making emergency communication plans, including forum for answering staff questions, providing staff with updated education and training on covid-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, and training for staff who need to use protective clothing and protective gear providing resources and working environment that help improve personal hygiene, requires hand washing, limit customer and the public access to work site, and post signs on hand washing and other covid-19 protections. According to specific tasks, at least, staff at risk of moderate exposure should be equipped with Personal Protective Gear, including gloves, robe, masks or goggles.
This type of staff better need a breathing apparatus.
If someone is sick on a plane, proper protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including placing the patient 6 Feet away from other passengers, designating a crew to serve the patient and provide masks to the patient, or ask patients to cover their nose with tissues while cough or sneezing.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves while caring for sick travellers, touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces. The crew should also wear extra personal protective gear if the sick travelers have symptoms such as fever, continuous cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items should be treated in bio-hazard bags, followed by cleaned and disinfect surfaces. For Commercial Transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, dangerous precautions also includes postponing travel when sick. If there is fever or other symptoms on board, self-isolation and notify the aboard medical room immediately.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated cabin. For Schools and childcare places, the CDC recommends that if the infected person has been present in school, it should be closed for a short term, regardless of the spread of the relevant schools and childcare places for thorough cleaning or disinfect.
Social distance strategies can be implemented for low-and medium-scale community transmission, such as cancellation of other large gatherings, rallies and sports classes, choir classes or cafeteria dining, increasing the distance between the desk, misconfinity and departures, and departures, limiting unnecessary visitor visits and separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
If the community is spreading badly, in addition to social distance strategies, you can consider extending the suspension period. For Law enforcement officers carrying out routine routine activities, the CDC believes it faces lower direct health risks.
It is recommended that law enforcement officers must be exposed to covid-19 diagnosed patients or suspected individuals should act at the same level of protection as first aid medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective gear.
If close contact occurs during the arrest, the staff member should clean and disinfect their service belt and equipment before using household cleaning spray or rags before cleaning, and should follow standard personal protective gear sealing and disposal procedures and clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA believes certain health care and mortuary staff are at high or very high exposure risks.
High-exposure staff includes physical contact with medical care, support, labs and medical transport staff for people known or suspected covid-19 infected.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff performs a foam generation program for known or suspected covid-19 patients, or collect or process specimens of infected or suspected to be infected.
Foam Generation programs include plugs, cough induction procedures, bronchoscope examination, some dental procedures and examinations, or physical cavity collection.
High-exposure mortuary staff included those involved in sorting the bodies of the dead, who were diagnosed or suspected cases of covid-19, and were at higher exposure if an autopsy was performed. Additional engineering measures to be taken against this group at risk also include isolation rooms for covid-19 diagnosed or suspected cases, including in the implementation of the foam generation program.
Some healthcare facilities and morgue can also be equipped with dedicated negative pressure ventilation systems.
Biosafety Level 3 precautions should be taken when dealing with specimens.
The World Health Organization (world health organization) recommends setting different waiting areas for patients based on whether the patient is a suspected case of covid-19 among other personal protective gear, the oshs also recommends that people working within 6 Feet of patients known or suspected to have been infected with SARS-Cov-2 and those who perform the foam generation program be worn pm
The United States requires the use of niosh-approved N95 filter masks or better masks in comprehensive written breathing protection programs environments such as health testing, training, medical examinations.
Other types of breathing apparatus can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. Who does not recommend protective clothing because covid-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
Who suggested entry point screenters just wear medical surgical masks.
For staff members who need to collect breathing specimens from covid-19 patients and provide care or transfer services for patients without having to carry out foam generation procedures, who suggests using medical surgical masks, goggles, robe and gloves pm
Medical surgical masks must be replaced with N95 or ffp2 mask if you want to be implemented.
In view of the shortage of personal protection equipment globally, who recommends that direct caregivers be allowed only access to covid-19 patient s' rooms through physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, only when it is indeed necessary to use personal protection equipment for specific tasks, continue to use the same breathing apparatus when nursing multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of Personal Protection Equipment Supply chain and discouraging asymask for asymask to reduce demand for personal protection equipment.

2019 Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and gas promotion.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle pain, diarrhea, pharyngeal pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The incubation period from exposure to illness ranged from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.
Although most cases have minor symptoms, some cases develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of December 2020, 4, the total number of cases reported in 210 countries and regions worldwide exceeded 2240 million, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people are currently recovered from treatment. The virus spreads mainly through close contact between people, often by drops generated by cough, sneezing or talking.
Although exhale produces foam, the foam usually falls to the ground or on the surface of various objects and does not cause long-range transmission.
Also, if someone touches the virus-contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose and mouth, they can be infected with the virus.
The virus can survive up to 72 hours on the surface of the object.
Although early and recovery may also spread, it is the most contagious three days before the disease. Standard diagnostic method is to conduct real-time reversal polymerase chain reaction (Rrrrrt-PCR).
People suspected of virus infection and their paramedics are advised to wear masks.
Suggestions for public wear masks vary everywhere, with some authorities opposing wearing masks and others asking for masks.
There are currently no covid-19 vaccine or special antiviral treatment.
Most countries in all six who regions have reported partial transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may be asymptoms or may have suspected flu symptoms such as fever, cough, inability and gas.
Urgent symptoms include breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or boobs, blurred consciousness, difficult to wake up and green face or lips; if these symptoms are recommended for immediate treatment.
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.
Different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were also detected.
Some cases in China only appear to have chest boobs and palpitations at the early stages.
Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, Multi-organ failure and even cause death.
We call this the incubation period.
Covid-19 incubation period is usually 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.
97.5 % of infected people have symptoms within 11.5 days after infection. The report states that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic infections in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully clear; however, prima evidence suggests that asymptomatic infections may contribute to the spread
The rate of asymptomatic infections has not been determined and research is still being stepped up. The South Korean centers for disease control and prevention (Kcdc) reported that 20 % of confirmed cases did not show any symptoms during hospitalization.
China's National Health commission on health has listed asymptomatic cases in daily notification since January 1; out of the 166 cases of 4 infected people on that day, 130 (78 %) are being tested time without symptoms.
Sputum and saliva can carry a large amount of viruses.
Speaking loudly spray more foam than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that an unblocked cough could cause foam to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 ft).
Although such viruses are generally not transmitted through air, the National Academy of sciences has determined that it may be transmitted through bioaerosol, with positive samples of the air collectors outside the ward.
Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR could spray respiratory secretions and thus cause air transmission.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through poop, but the risk is considered lower. The virus is most contagious when symptoms arise; although it may spread before symptoms, the risk is lower.
The European center for disease control (Ecdc) said that while the spread of the new corovirus is not entirely clear, the average of 1 PEOPLE CAN INFECT 2-3 people. The virus lives on the surface of the object ranged from hours to days.
Specifically, the new corovirus is known to survive on cardboard for a day, with up to three days on plastic (Polyacrylic) and Stainless Steel (Aisi 304), with up to 99 % Purity Copper products four hours to survive.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.
Soap and cleaners can also kill the virus if used correctly. Soap products can degrade the virus's fat protective layer, making it inactive while also clearing the virus from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzadized ammonium chlorohexine glucose (a surgical sterilization) are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China shows that saliva samples were collected on average two days after being admitted to hospital.
5/6 patients had the highest virus load in the first sample, while 1/6 patients detected the following day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona virus that was first separated from three pneumonia patients in wuhan out.
All the features of this new sars-Cov-2 virus are present in nature's associated corona virus.
Before entering the human body, the virus can be killed with home soap because soap can destroy the virus's Protective Cystic Film. Sars-Cov-2 is closely related to the ORIGINAL SARS-Cov.
The lungs are the most affected organ affected by Covid-19, as the virus enters host cells through Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ace2), which has the highest content in type ii lung.
The virus combines with ace2 and enter the host cell through a special surface sugar protein called " puncture
12 % of patients admitted to hospitals in wuhan, China found acute myocardial injury, with a higher percentage of severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are higher due to deterioration of the disease and immune system disorders, but acute cardiovascular injury may also be linked to the heart's ace2 receptors.
Ace2 receptors express highly in the heart and participate in regulating heart function.
It is reported that high rates of blood thrombosis (31 %) and vein ICU-19 infected people (25 %) and may be related to poor prognosis. An Autopsy of covid-19 dead patient found diffuse alveolar injury (Dad), with inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although Sars-Cov-2 is addictive to respiratory epithelial cells that express ace2, people with covid-19 severe inflammation will have a full body.
In particular, pathogenic gm-CSF secretion t cells in covid-19 patients are linked to the collection of inflammatory il-6 secretive monocytes and severe lung pathology.
Autopsy reports also saw lymphocytes infiltration.
Who has announced several disease detection programs.
The Standard method is using real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (Rrrt-PCR).
This test usually examines respiratory samples obtained through nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swab or phlegm samples can also be used.
Generally, results can be obtained in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be performed, but two weeks between two blood samples are required, and results are hardly instant value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate coroneal strains and publish gene sequences so that labs around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection agents to detect infection with the virus.
As of December 4, 2020, Antibody Testing (not only can detect active infections but also whether an individual has been infected with the virus in the past) is still under development, but has not been promoted.
According to China's experience, testing accuracy ranged from 60 to 70 %.
On December 21, 2020, the U.S. FDA approved its first instant diagnostic reagent and put into use at the end of the month. The Diagnostic Guide Issued by Wuhan University's central south hospital proposes methods to detect infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risks.
Early infections are mostly seen in double lung multi-Leaf Glass Shadow, with asymmetrical and rear distribution.
As the virus develops, there may be subpleural dominance, gravel road symptoms (interval thickened with varying degrees of lung) and lung changes.
Very little information about covid-19 micropathologic injuries and pathology.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy are as follows:
Naked Eye Examination: chest inflammation, cardiac inflammation, lung and lung edema
Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Mild Pneumonia: lung edema, lung cell hyperplasia, large number of atypical lung cells, interstigmesia accompanied by lymphocytes infiltration and
Severe Pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (Dad) accompanied by diffuse alveolar seepage.
Dad is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards) and severe hypoxia.
Recovery Pneumonia: mechanisation of alveolar cavity and interlung fibrosis
Blood: diffusing intravascular coagulation (Dic); Young White-young red cell reaction
Precautions that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home; avoiding entering crowded areas; washing hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; avoiding touch without washing hands eyes, nose or mouth.
The CDC recommends using tissue to cover your mouth and nose when cough or sneezing; if there is no tissue, the inner side of the elbow is recommended.
It is recommended to properly clean your hands after cough or sneezing.
CDC suggests wearing masks in public to prevent the spread of the virus to some extent by asymptoms. at the core of social distance strategy is closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel and cancelling large public gatherings, thus reducing access to large-scale groups.
Plus, social distance guidelines provide for at least 6 Feet (1.8 m) distance in interpersonal relationships.
There are no effective drugs to prevent covid-19 yet. Since vaccines are expected to be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce peak outbreak is key to controlling the spread of covid-19, what we know as "draw epidemiological curves".
At the same time, the CDC suggests that people wash their hands regularly with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there is a toilet or when there is obvious dirt on their hands, before meal and after blowing their nose, cough or sneezing.
In addition, it is recommended to wash your hands with at least 60 % alcohol content, but only when there is no soap and tap water around you. for areas where water free hand washing can't be purchased, who offers two recipes for local production.
These recipes inspire antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
Using hydrogen peroxide helps eliminate bacterial spore in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not " hand sterilized active
Add Glycerin As Moisturizer.
Providing supportive care for people, which could include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other vital organ support.
CDC suggests that suspected virus carriers wear easy masks.
In vitro membrane oxygen synthesis (ECMO) has been used to relieve respiratory failure symptoms, but its benefits remain to be studied.
It is recommended to improve immunity by maintaining personal hygiene and promoting healthy lifestyles and eating habits.
Supportive therapy may be effective for those infected with early light disorders. Who and China's National Health Council have launched an initiative calling for proper care of covid-19 patients admitted to hospital.
U.S. critical pathologists and lung experts have compiled treatment advice from various agencies and made available free through ibcc.
As of December 2020, Covid-19 special therapy has not been developed.
For some symptoms, some medical experts suggest using paraminophone (Acetaminol) instead of ibuprofen treatment.
Precautions must be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, completing operations that can produce aerosol in medical environments such as intubing or hand ventilation.
For paramedics looking after covid-19 patients, the CDC suggests that patients should be transferred to airborne infectious disease isolation rooms (Aiir), in addition to standard precautions, contact precautions and air transmission precautions. CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) during the outbreak.
Recommended Equipment: PPE protective clothing, breathing or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If you can, it's better use a breaker (not masks).
N95 masks are allowed to be used in industrial occasions, but FDA has been authorized to use this mask under emergency use (Eua).
It is mainly used to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (such as dust), but there is no guarantee effective isolation of specific biological agents when used for other purposes.
If there is no masks, CDC suggests using masks and can wear homemade masks if necessary.
Most Covid-19 cases have lower symptoms and do not require mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Paramedics are actively conducting research in hopes of providing breathing support for covid-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms. There is evidence that high flow oxygen therapy or dual-phase airway positive pressure ventilation can be avoided.
It is unclear whether the two treatments mentioned above will have the same therapeutic effect for serious patients.
If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use creative mechanical ventilation because the technique can also limit the spread of aerosol particles compared to hyperflow oxygen therapy. Severe cases are mostly among older people (especially those over 80 years old).
Many developed countries are not enough beds per capita, and due to limited medical conditions, the medical system cannot cope with the grim situation in the surge in covid-19 cases.
A study in China found that 5 % of patients need to be sent to ICU, 2.3 % of patients need mechanical ventilation and 1.4 % will die as a result.
About 30 % of covid-19 admitted patients in China are finally admitted to ICU.
With the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards) caused by Covid-19, mechanical ventilation complexity has increased further and oxygen syndrome.
At that time, support stress control mode and high peep breathing machines are needed to maximize oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax.
Old-fashioned breaker may not achieve high peep.
Research on potential treatments since January 2020, several antivirus have now entered the clinical trial stage.
Redsiway seems to be one of the most promising drugs at the moment.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or have entered advanced testing stages.
Serious patients can try using antiviral drugs.
Who calls on a wide range of volunteers to participate in testing of potential therapy effectiveness and safety. The FDA has temporarily authorized blood transfusion during recovery period as experimental treatment to treat critically ill patients.
The necessary clinical study has not been carried out to prove whether the therapy is safe and effective.
China released a mobile app to curb outbreaks in December 2020
Users must enter their name and id number as required.
This app can determine potential infection risk by monitoring data testing " close contact
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
Once potential risks are detected, the app will not only recommend self-isolation, but also alerts local health officials. Combining Mobile Data Analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected people and their contacts in South Korea, China and Singapore.
In December 2020, the Israeli government approved security agencies to track mobile data of suspected corona carriers.
The measure was taken with the purpose of forcibly segregation and protecting groups that may be exposed to infected citizens.
Also in December 2020, Deutsche Telecom shared compiled mobile location data with the German Federal Government Agency Robert Koch Institute to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect people violating isolation.
Italian regional health commissioner giulio gallera noted that mobile phone operator data shows "40 % of citizens are still walking around".
The German government hosted a 48-hour weekend hacker marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, Estonia president kersti kaljulaid called for creative solutions globally to prevent the spread of the corona virus.
Segregation, travel restrictions, treating side effects or fear of self-infection can all be disturbing.
The BBC quotes Rory O ' Connor's opinion: " Social Isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic downturn are the perfect storms to hurt people's mental health and well-being."
The disease is milder and symptoms have few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as common cold.
Minor cases can normally be recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical cases can take three to six weeks to recover.
According to data from other similar viruses (such as sars and mers), pregnant women are at higher risk of developing into covid-19 severe illness, but lack of data support from covid-19 Covid-19 may have an impact on some people's lungs, causing pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, Covid-19 could rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards), leading to respiratory failure, decative shock or multi-organ failure.
Covid-19 related complications include sepsis, blood condensing abnormal, and heart, kidney and liver injuries.
6 % of covid-19 admitted patients had blood covid-19 patients, especially with prolonged time extension, while 4 % of patients in the group had kidney dysfunction.
About 20-30 % of covid-19 patients with Liver Enzyme (Traminase) increased.
According to the same report, the average time between illness to death was ten days, with an average length of hospitalization of five days.
However, the average time for patients transferred to ICU to death was seven days.
Early Case studies found that the average time between early symptoms to death was 14 days, with an overall time period of 6 to 41 days.
A study by China's National Health Council of health (Nhc) found that male mortality is 2.8 percent and female mortality is 1.7 %.
Anatomy Lung sample histopathologic examination showed that diffused alveolar injuries along with cellular fiber mucus secretion.
Viral cell disease was observed in lung cells.
Lung Images Are similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards).
11.8 % of deaths reported by China's National Health commission on health caused cardiac injuries due to higher levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data released in the U.S. in January, 89 % of admitted patients have a history of illness. The supply of medical resources and regional socioeconomic conditions could also affect mortality.
Due to regional differences and methodological difficulties, the results vary.
Underestimating minor cases can lead to overestimated mortality.
However, if the case death is due to previous infections, it may mean current mortality is underrated.
Compared to non-Smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop into covid-19 severe illness, and about 2.4 times more likely to be in need of serious care or death. People are concerned about the long-term aftermath of the disease.
The hospital authority in Hong Kong, China found that the lung activity of some of some of the rehab fell between 20 % and 30 % and lung scanning shows organ damage.
Plus, after recovery, you may face severe post-custody syndrome.
As of December 2020, it is unclear whether previous infections will give rehabilitated patients an effective long-lasting immune.
It is identified as a potential for immunity based on other corovirus behavioural features, but some covid-19 cases reportedly tested positive soon after recovery.
These cases are believed to be a deterioration of infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is believed to be a natural virus that originated in animals and is infected by spill.
The actual origins have yet to be determined, but as of January 2019, the scope of infection was almost exclusively human transmission.
The first batch of 41 confirmed covid-19 case studies released in January 1, 2020, showed that the earliest date of disease was 1
Who official publication reported the earliest date of the disease is January 8, 2019
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region and will vary over time, and be affected by demographic features such as age, quality of health systems, treatment, the first outbreak and general health status.
At the end of 2019, who designated ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07. 1 TO LABORATORY DIAGNOSED SARS-Cov-2 infections, designated u07. 2 to clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed infections Covid-19 but undiagnosed sars-Cov-2 deaths without lab. The death rate is equal to the total number of deaths within a given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.
According to John Hopkins University Statistics, the global death rate was 6.9 % (153,822/2,240,191) as of January 17
Death rates vary from region to region. other measures also include case mortality (CFR) and infectious mortality (Ifr), which reflects the percentage of disease deaths as a percentage of diagnosed people diagnosed, which reflects the number of deaths from diseases (including diagnosed and undiagnosed) percentage.
These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process of specific populations from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infections.
Italian outbreak centre castiglione d ' Adda, a town of just 4600 people, has now died from the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spreads through carnival days and even affects young people, but the death rate is relatively low and not all covid-19 deaths are officially classified.
Moreover, the German healthcare system has been overwhelmed.
About 3 % of Dutch citizens may have antibodies, according to blood donor assessment.
So far, 69 people (0.004 % of the total population) have been confirmed to have died from covid-19.
The impact and mortality rates vary by gender.
Studies in China and Italy show that men have higher mortality rates than women.
Men aged 50-60 are at the highest risk of death, with the gender gap in only 90 years old.
China's male mortality rate is 2.8 % and female mortality rate is 1.7 %.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unclear, but it may be caused by genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based immunology differences, women have lower smoking rates and men with syndrome (such as high blood pressure), leading to higher mortality rates for men than women.
In Europe, 57 per cent of men are infected, and the total number of deaths due to covid-19 is as high as 72 %.
As of December 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked gender-related data on covid-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and sars have different effects on men and women.
Women's health workers (especially nurses) are higher and more likely to be exposed to the virus.
On December 11, 2020, the world health organization announced the official name of the disease as "Covid-19".
Who in charge tedros adhanom ghebreyesus explains this :CO represents " Crown vi represents " viral d represents " Disease 19 represents the first outbreak of the outbreak (January 31, 2019 day).
The name was chosen to avoid quoting specific geographic locations (such as China), animal species or populations in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that triggered covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
In addition, who also uses the " Covid-19 virus " and " triggered covid-19 ".
Diseases and viruses are commonly known as "Corona virus".
During the first outbreak in wuhan, China, the virus and diseases were widely referred to as " Corona virus " and " Wuhan Corona virus ".
In December 2020, who recommended 2019-Ncov and 2019-Ncov acute respiratory diseases as names as temporary viral names, based on the 2015 guide on location in disease and viruses and viruses.
Official Names Covid-19 and SARS-Cov-2. were released on January 11, 2020
Given the capacity limit in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers have started printing health care materials such as nose swab and breathing parts.
An Italian hospital, for example, urgently needed ventilation valves, the supplier could not deliver parts within the required time, a local startup carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 ventilation valves overnight.
Conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origins, prevention, treatment and other areas of the disease were spreading quickly through the origins of the covid-19 outbreak.
Humans seem capable of spreading the virus to other animals.
Studies have found no evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines for the treatment of the disease have been approved.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively conducting international research to develop vaccines and drugs to treat covid-19
In December, the world health organization launched a "solidarity test" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds currently most likely to produce therapeutic effects
There are currently no vaccines, but agencies at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.
As Sars-COV AND SARS-Cov-2 both enter human cells through ace2 receptors, there is a need to take advantage of previous SARS-Cov's previous work.
Three vaccine strategies are being studied.
First, researchers plan to develop an all-virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, both inactive or death viruses, aims to provoke a rapid immune response in the body when new covid-19
The second strategy is to develop subunit vaccines designed to develop a vaccine that inspire the immune system to respond to certain subunits of the virus.
IN THE CASE OF SARS-Cov-2, such research focused on s-assisted viruses that invades the ace2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is to develop a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA OR RNA VACCINE, a new technique for vaccine development).
The safety and effectiveness of test vaccines developed by these strategies must be tested. Four Seattle volunteers launched their first clinical trial for vaccine on January 16, 2020
The vaccine contains harmless sequences of genes from the virus that cause the disease. It has been argued that antibody Dependencies could be a major challenge in developing sars-Cov-2 vaccines.
As of January 2020, more than 300 clinical trials were conducted.
Seven tests have been evaluated and approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.
Converted antiviral drug use accounts for the vast majority of China's research, with nine stage III clinical trials in multiple countries by the end of 4
As of December 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of covid-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has begun. Several existing antiviral drugs for covid-19 are currently being evaluated, including redcivie, chloroquine and hydroxychlopinawi / litonawi and lopinawi / litonawi interferon beta.
As of January 2020, redseway's therapeutic effect has been initially confirmed.
The clinical symptoms of patients with sympathy medicine redsiway have been relieved.
Stage III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. In December 2020, CHINA LAUNCHED CHLOROQUINE (used to treat malaria) research with initial results.
However, there are calls for peer reviews for the study.
Health authorities in South Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, wuhan virology institute recommends taking 1 grams per day, while reminding double doses are dangerous and even fatal.
On December 28, 2020, FDA issued emergency use licenses for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to treat covid-19 patients with both of these two drugs. China's seventh edition of the guide also proposes to treat covid-19. Using Interferon, ribaverin or abidore hydrochloride.
Preliminary data suggests high doses of ribaverin vitro inhibiting sars-Cov-2
After confirming the low concentration inhibitory effect of SARS-Cov-2, it is recommended to conduct further in-body research using nidst. Studies have shown that the original thorn induced by Trasine 2 (tmprss2) is a necessary condition for SARS-Cov-2 interact with ace2 receptors into the human body.
Whether combined with achimycin or not, chloroquine research has serious limitations that the medical community cannot accept these treatments unless further study. OSTAWAY HAS NO INHIBITORY EFFECT ON SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, and has yet to be therapeutic for covid-19
Cytokine storms could become a complication of post-treatment for covid-19 severe illness.
There is evidence that hydrochloroquine may have anti-Cytokine storms. After completing a small study, China's National Health Committee on health included tobeads in the treatment guide.
Italy is conducting a 2 Non-random test at the national level, following positive results for severe illness patients.
Combining Serum Iron blood tests to identify cytokine storms designed to curb the disease, which are believed to cause some of the deaths of the infected people.
In 2017, backed by retrospective case studies, FDA approved the use of Leukin 6 receptor antagonist to treat steroid intractable cytokine release syndrome, known as car t cell therapy.
So far, there is no randomly controlled evidence that tobeads can effectively treat crs.
The purified concentrated antibodies produced by Covid-19 Rehab Immune System is being studied to be injected to people in need of antibodies as passive immunotherapy before vaccine development.
This strategy was tried during the sars outbreak, but its therapeutic is undecided.
Viral neutralization is an expected mechanism for Passive Antibody Therapy Mediating Sars-Cov-2 Immune Defense.
However, some other mechanisms such as antibody Reliance on cytotoxicity and / or swallow to achieve the same effect.
Other forms of Passive Antibody Therapy are currently being developed, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies
Serum production during recovery may increase, which will benefit rapid deployment. The Serum is composed of liquid parts of the blood of rehabilitated patients, which contains specific antibodies against the virus.
Corovirus disease, a set of closely related syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor in central wuhan hospital, raised awareness about the spread of the new covid-19 and died.
Stores in Australia lower the limit of toilet paper per deal
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australia's chain stores woolworths and coles lowered the maximum purchase of toilet paper purchases for all their stores nationwide to two packs and one pack, respectively.
Aldi also introduced a one-Pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of messages on the checkout counter or on the chain's Facebook page.
Buyers are hoarding goods for fear of covid-19 in case they need self-segregation.
Woolworths also limited the number of toilet paper purchases delivered to door to each single pack on Wednesday.
Before these changes, Woolworths and coles introduced the limit of 4 PACKS PER TRANSACTION ON MARCH 4 AND 5, respectively.
Coles reported in its press release on March 8th that " many stores are still sold out within one hour after arrival " and said demand is " unprecedented," meanwhile, Aldi called it " unexpected " in Tuesday's Facebook post.
Last week's sales "dramatically increased". according to a woolworths spokesman.
Last week, Canberra's Costco store also limited the number allowed to two packs.
To further alleviate the shortfall, Coles ordered greater packaging from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional stock while aldi prepared in advance for the planned Wednesday special offer.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian retailer s' Association, says retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council's restrictions on the delivery time of trucks make it difficult.
He expects that production costs will rise and preferential activities will decrease as suppliers try to meet demand.
Aldi announced Tuesday that some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday's special event after early release of inventory.
At News.Com. In a au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of science and technology, says the store replenish inventory every night.
He said toilet paper is large items and therefore less stock, and that once sold out, leaving huge shelf space, adding to the shortage of supplies.
" Coles and Woolworths's view is that if there were a lot of things on the shelves, goods such as rolls and hand washing fluid could [Buy] and in sufficient quantities." Russell Zimmerman told ABC news.
Recycled Toilet Paper Maker who gives a crap said last Wednesday they are running out of stock
According to News.com. Kimberly-Clark, who made shujie toilet paper and solbent toilet paper both stressed that they were working all day and weekends to guarantee supply.
Real Estate website Domain.com reports that some real estate agents will offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, as buyers are closed on the long weekend.
Nt news, a daily printed in Darwin City, contains 8-page centerfold in its Thursday edition of newspaper designed to be used as toilet paper after cutting.
The store was initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia on March 3, saying they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other commodities is also high, including masks, hand washing, dry goods, hand washing and flour.
Also, outside Australia, UK online supermarket ocado limited the number of Andres toilet paper purchases to 2 Packs, 12 volumes per pack on Sunday night.

We have had some tough situations since this month.
In the face of the covid-19 epidemic, we clearly felt the fate of all humanity, while recognizing our responsibility towards each other.
We are facing unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best measures to address such challenges require people around the world to feel, work together and promote community building, which is at the core of wikimedia.
The spread of friendship and care to each other through emails, phone and chatting, is ample proof of the extraordinary nature of our colleagues and how fortunate we have been able to work with you.
I am so grateful and proud to be colleagues with you.
Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is that Wikipedia is now available around the world, while also making me realize the symbolic power that this crucial resource keeps running properly.
Whether your job is in charge of website operations, pay or community safety, Wikimedia's hard work.
The world now needs information from Wikipedia more than ever.
At this stage, the content of our work and the way we work will have a significant impact on the world.
In view of the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities that our colleagues have shouldered, we will make some important changes to the way we work together starting next week.
Working methods and schedule adjustment
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss how the company works and schedule over the next few days to months.
At the meeting, we considered what we consider the appropriate response to the challenges facing companies today, as well as best practices to ensure companies sustainable development during the epidemic.
The Executive team has agreed to relieve stress for company employees so that you can support the company's mission in the long term.
We support you to properly relieve work stress.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours a day (or 20 hours a week), with further notice of any changes.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer every day, we will arrange tasks based on how long you work.
However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as caring for your family, shopping or visiting a doctor.
We won't track your working hours.
If you're sick, please drop your work.
Although this is self-evident, we still want to remind you that you can rest assured.
You don't need to take sick or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team modify the work calendar and schedule to ensure that key work areas are not affected.
(if you are diagnosed as covid-19 positive, please inform Bryan of talents and culture operations that the department will support you and ensure that your situation gets proper attention from management. PM
For Hourly Pay, we will pay in full.
We have already expressed and again pledged to keep the promises made to contractors and colleagues in the hour.
The salary we pay to all will continue to be calculated based on the compensation they receive for completing normal working hours.
Even if you're sick or unable to work is no exception.
If you are willing to work, we will support you.
Many choose to communicate with the outside world through work to release their stress.
Our work can bring incredible returns, especially in times like this.
But taking care of yourself is still first.
We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can keep up to date with you and make adjustments accordingly.
Important jobs are guaranteed priority.
We have to keep some important work running properly.
The work carried out by the website reliability engineering team, hr operation team, trust and security teams and fundraising teams (and other teams) are crucial, which may require additional support.
We will start assessing current goals with all departments and shifting our focus to supporting something that are essential to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus our work on the most important items.
Slowing down for the moment will not affect future development.
We are not planning to "overtime" after the epidemic.
We won't ask you to catch up overtime because now it doesn't seem realistic.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.
What changes will the app (Annual Plan)?
In order to accommodate the new reality and daily working time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for 2020-2021
We hope to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time spent on budgeting so that staff can prioritize key jobs and take care of themselves and their families; at the same time, adjust for those who need or wish to reduce their work in the coming weeks organization of work.
Extending the timetable could significantly reduce the current planned workloads across the organization and reduce work pressure.
We will present the above proposal to the board next week. If the proposal is passed, we will update the representatives and the teams as soon as possible.
Thanks to the app team for the leadership in the process.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a San Francisco office colleague may have been exposed to the covid-19 virus.
However, with caution, we hired some anti-virus cleaners to complete disinfect the San Francisco Office.
They used hospital-level sterilization solutions to sterilize various surfaces as well as the halls and elevators that lead to our floors.
The Office building is fulfilling its due diligence agreement by using corresponding products to ensure the safety of tenants.
We believe that when you decide to return to work, the office is fully prepared for everyone.
Our Washington DC office is using the wework office, wework shares the covid-19 agreement with us and all Washington DC staff.
As of last week, the Washington DC office has been converted to telecommuted to full staff in accordance with the guidance we shared with the San Francisco Office.
At the same time, as some colleagues at the New York office already know, we have been discussing issues related to renting offices in Brooklyn area.
These discussions are still ongoing, but may be postponed.
Some colleagues are in touch with telecommuting for the first time.
Other Long-term telecommuting colleagues would like to give these colleagues some advice on how they work:
Meeting time should be controlled within one or two hours.
For longer time, consider scattering the content of the meeting into multiple dates.
Clearly set meeting goals, set the agenda for the meeting, and send reading material ahead.
Use videoconferencing as the default mode of meeting, while using tools like google docs and zoom for online collaboration and contact.
At each meeting, a moderator is arranged to host the meeting, arrange one person responsible for monitoring questions in the chat window and following changes in the list of speakers, and arrange another person responsible (or using a multi-person collaborative approach) to help with meeting records.
If you need comfortable headphones, please email the technical support department.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Join #Remoties channel on slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The hr operation team is working on ergonomic guidance in the form of webinar to help all of foundation colleagues improve productivity during distributed office.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editors before who announced the end of the epidemic.
These requests for cancellation of activities and other restrictions may cause these community recipients from completing the planned donation activity, we have told them that we understand this, while also promised that none of them will be postponing or modifying these goals and get punished.
Over the coming week, we will continue to provide more guidance at community conferences and theme community conferences in wikimania and beyond.
The Global community currently seems to be shrouded in sadness over the devastation of the epidemic, but it also reflects relief for being able to keep a clear focus on their communities, wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT team will build a page on meta-Wiki, providing the community a space to monitor impact and track the community's communication with us.
Stay in touch with covid-19 related issues
We are planning a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 PM (PST) / 07:00 (PST) and we will send an invitation to your calendar later.
During the meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and make some time for everyone to discuss.
We are united to help you here.
In the meantime, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to covid-19
The CRT team will update these pages in time and gather all the information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries / regions currently severely affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions about travel, events, main workflow or insurance, or need help from other areas, please feel free to contact and work with the CRT team.
We are here to provide you the necessary support and contact.
If you have a secret or sensitive issue, please email Bryan Jordan, head of hr operations worldwide.
While we face these changes, we cannot give up our jobs and obligations as a result.
Instead, this outbreak makes us realize that we may need to adjust our work and obligations in a way we have never before.
We believe that these measures are necessary to allow us to support each other in continuing their work done, providing the necessary support for our actions and continue to bring the services they depend on.
Make plans at all times, you can't fear the challenges.
Now, please support each other to create space for important work in the coming weeks or even months.
We need everyone to contribute to that goal, so please take care of yourself and your family so that you can stay in the best form when needed.
Finally, please remember to wash your hands hard and don't touch your face.
Katherine, CRT team (Amanda K, Amy v, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory v, Jaime v, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M & Tony s) with other members of the team (Grant I, Heather w, Jaime, Jaime, dear janeen u, Lisa S, Robyn a, Ryan M and Toby n).
There is a need to update on the diagnostic criteria for covid-19 " suspected cases " and " diagnosed cases "
On December 2, 2020, our team released the " quick recommendation guide to the diagnosis and treatment of new cov infections of the 2019 new cov (2019-Ncov) infection, through which we have been used for the global response to the global response to the experience and lessons are provided.
However, 2019 Covid-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our awareness of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to an opinion on the aforementioned guide and provide an update based on the latest covid-19 Treatment Program (Version 19) released by the National Health Health Committee of the people's Republic of China " diagnostic criteria for suspected cases " and " diagnosed cases
2019 new corona virus (2019-Ncov) erupted in December 2019, which has been officially named 2019 Covid-12 Covid-19 the virus was once named severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 Corona virus (SARS-Cov-2).
Who (who) listed covid-19 as a global pandemic on December 3, 2020
To Combat Sars-Cov-2 infections, our team developed a quick recommendation guide, which was released online in military medical research magazine on January 06, 2020
It has attracted widespread attention since its release.
However, please note that covid-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our awareness of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the people's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) released a total of 7 Version of the covid between 1 to January 16-19 treatment program, some of which has changed significantly.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others who have proposed a simple scoring program based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guide and valuable reference to the global pandemic.
We recognize and thank them for this important work.
However, their proposal also needs to be updated in the light of the latest covid-19 Treatment Program (trial version 19) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (January 3, 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases requires combining an epidemiological historical feature with two clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis without a clear epidemiological history three clinical manifestations need to be met:
Epidemiology History: (1) travel or residence in wuhan city and around wuhan city or other communities reported cases within 14 days before symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-Cov-2 infections (positive) ;(3) Covid-14 days before symptoms appeared with covid-19 was reported from wuhan city or other reported patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the community have a history of contact; (4) with aggregate diagnosed cases (within 2 weeks before symptoms, contact with fever and / or respiratory symptoms) such as home, office, school classes, etc) have a history of contact.
Clinical Performance: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of covid-19 infections; (2) the total number of leukocytes is normal or decreasing early in the disease, and
Diagnosis of diagnosed cases should be based on suspected cases and with any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) Real-TIME PCR TEST FOR SARS-Cov-2; (2)) viral full genome sequencing shows highly homology with known new corovirus ;(3) specific igm and igg antibodies targeted at SARS-Cov-2 In Serum tests; or SARS-Cov-2 the specific igg antibody goes from negative to positive, or increased by 4 times during recovery period, higher than in the acute period.
As we can see, the second version (January 18, 2020) and third edition (22) add real-time pcr in respiratory tract or blood specimen testing.
Blood Specimen Pathogenic test was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and 2th Edition (8) and serum was added to the seventh edition learn the evidence.
The changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to study the best nuclear acid test kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens including blood harvesting, which increases the availability of different specimens and to incorporate positive results of specific antibodies into diagnosis the standard provides evidence.
In addition, there is growing evidence to remind us of atypical symptoms and symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou and others should be updated because they categorize people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
In addition, scoring systems need to be validated in further clinical practices and research.
Finally, we want more direct evidence and call on readers to give their views.
For the diagnosis of " suspected cases " and " diagnosed cases we recommend reference and follow the latest guidelines in the country where the case is located.
Our team will also update our guide in time to help.
Bangladesh reported 5 NEW COVID-19 deaths, reaching a single-day high
Yesterday, BANGLADESH CONFIRMED 5 NEW COVID-19 deaths on that day.
This has hit a new high number of single-day deaths caused by the virus.
As of yesterday, there are 114 confirmed cases and 33 cases reported by the Bangladesh Institute of epidemiology, disease control and disease control and 33 cases were cured after rest at home.
A cumulative death toll of 17
At An Online Press Conference, iedcr head Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included 4 MALE AND 1 Women.
According to Dr. Meerjady, 2 cases were aged 60 years old, 2 between the ages of 51-60 and 1 AND 1 between 41-50
She also said 2 of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (who) declared covid-19 as pandemic on March 11
A hospital official revealed to local news media anadolu agency that one of the deceased was jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladeshi Anti-corruption commission, who was treated at kuwait maitree hospital.
Bangladeshi road transport and bridges minister obaidul quader announced in an online video that public transport will extend beyond originally planned until this Saturday.
The public transport stop began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4
Basic materials such as medical, fuel and food are still available for normal transportation.
On March 8, 2 of the first confirmed cases of covid-19 in Bangladesh returned from Italy and 1 were the wives of 1 diagnosed patients.
As of March 19, ALL 3 patients had recovered.
The World Health Organization declares covid-19 a pop
The World Health Organization (who) declared the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 (disease caused by Cov-2) as a pandemic.
While the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of disease and not the risk of specific cases, who noted the need to urge the government to take measures:
" all countries / regions can still change the process of this pandemic.
If countries / regions test, treat, isolate, track and mobilise their people as a response," who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said.
" we are deeply concerned about the alarming extent of proliferation and gravity and the alarming extent of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former CDC director, the pandemic was "unprecedented".
" apart from flu, no respiratory virus has been detected to spread globally since its appearance, he commented on CNN in February."
Ghebreyesus expressed similar views and said " we've never seen a Corona-induced epidemic before."
" equally, we've never seen a viral epidemic that can be controlled before." he continued.
Before entering a new state of the pandemic, who identified the outbreak in January as an outbreak of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for allergy and infectious diseases, said about the outbreak: " most importantly, it's still worsening."
As of Thursday, the associated press reported at least 126000 cases of covid-19 worldwide, killing more than 4600 people.
2019 lab tests for respiratory covid-19 and related Sars-Cov-2 virus include: detecting the presence of the virus and whether antibodies are produced after infection.
RT-PCR CAN DETECT RNA of corona and determine whether the virus is present in the sample.
This test is a specific test for SARS-Cov-2 VIRAL RNA.
It can be used to determine whether recently been infected or active infection.
Antibody Detection (Serum test) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody Tests show how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with minor symptoms without reporting or asymptoms.
This test results determine the exact mortality rate of disease, as well as population immunity levels.
Due to limited number of tests, no country / region was able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population as of October 2020
As of December 23, no country / region tested more than 3 percent of its population, and the number of tests completed vary dramatically across countries.
The discrepancy can also seriously affect reported case mortality rates, which in some countries, may be severely overrated.
Real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (Rrrt-PCR) test using throat swab can only get reliable results only within the first week of infection.
Generally, results can be obtained in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR Tests using swabbing can only get reliable results only within the first week of infection with the virus.
After that, the virus disappeared in the throat, but continues to breed in the lungs.
For those infected who are tested in the second week of infection, the sample can be replaced with deep respiratory extract obtained through phlegm pipe or cough extract (phlegm).
Rrt-PCR was released at charitÃ© hospital in Berlin in January 2020, one of the early pcr tests and became 250,000 tests distributed by the world health organization, who) the basis of the test box.
On January 1, 2020, the UK also developed a test method. Korean company kogenebiotech developed a clinical, PCR-Cov-2 Test Kit (Powerchek Coronavirus).
It looks for all the "e" Genes shared by beta corona virus, as well as the rdrp genes unique to SARS-Cov-2 in China, the bgi group is one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from China's National Drug Administration for the production of SARS-Cov-2 Test Kit. In The United States, the CDC has distributed 2019 new corona virus (2019-Ncov) Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panels to public health labs through the International Reagent Resources Department.
Early versions of the test kit used three genetic testing methods, one of which could not be determined due to a defects in the test, while at the same time, the Atlanta CDC has detector bottlenecks; this led to daily throughout February 2020 the average number of samples successfully processed is less than 100
The State and local labs were not allowed to start testing until January 28, 2020
The test was approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. U.S. Commercial Labs started testing in early January 3
Labcorp announced that covid-19 testing based on RT-PCR will be available nationwide starting from January 5, 2020
Quest Diagnostics has also announced that it will be available nationwide covid-19 testing starting January 9
No quantity limit announced; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, Covid-19 testing is developed and produced by the National Center for viral and biotechnology research (Vector).
On January 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Russian federal health supervision agency. On December 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test box that can detect covid-19 infection. On December 3, 2020, A Roche Diagnostics Test method was approved by FDA, which can complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, allowing a device to be within 24 hours about 4,128 tests were conducted.
On December 3, 2020, FDA Issued Emergency Use Authorization (Eua) Using Abbott's M2000 System for testing (Eua) to abbott labcorp and Thermo Fisher scientific similar authorisation.
On December 21, 2020, a cepheid test that took about 45 minutes was also granted an emergency use of FDA.
The FDA has approved a test method to replace pcr with isothermal amplification technology.
Since the method does not require a series of thermal cycles, positive results can be produced in just 5 minutes and negative results can be determined within 13 minutes.
The United States currently has about 18,000 such devices, and Abbott is expected to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a method for testing using monoclonal antibodies (specially combined with the new corona virus) Protein (n protein) in the hope that it can be in 15 to 20 minutes like rapid flu test provide test results.
A review of the literature in January 2020 concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnosis of the chest is of little, and the performance of ct [ computer fault scanning ] may be obvious, even in symptoms before appearing"
Typical features of ct include double lung multi-Leaf Grinding Glass Shadows, with peripheral asymmetrical
As the disease progresses, subbra dominant, gravel road signs and lung changes will be developed.
A study comparing pcr and ct in wuhan (where the current pandemic's initial outbreak) shows that ct is much more sensitive than pcr, but with lower precision of ct, its many imaging features with other pneumonia overlap with disease.
As of December 2020, the American radiological society recommended that "ct should not be used to screen covid-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing covid-19". since January 3 at first, CDC suggested using pcr for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is producing antibodies, including igm and igg.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections around 7 days after symptoms begin to determine the immune status of people subject to monitoring. The measurements can be done in central laboratory (CLT) or through instant detection (Poct).
Many High-Flux Automated systems in clinical labs can perform these measurements, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by sequential samples, it is usually measured using a peripheral blood specimen.
For Poct, skin piercing is usually used to get a blood sample.
Extraction Steps are not required before determination, unlike the pcr method. On December 26, 2020, FDA approved 29 declared testing methods that are now able to distribute their antibody test kits.
As of December 7, 2020, FDA had approved only one test under emergency use authorization. In late October 2020, the test kits of eumong and epitope diagnosticks were approved in Europe, which could detect igg and iga antibodies in blood samples.
Hundreds of samples can be detected within hours, thus, in measuring viral RNA IS MUCH FASTER THAN TRADITIONAL PCR.
Normally, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the infection begins. in early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased was enough to use.
Hong Kong has set up a mechanism for suspected patients to stay at home: " the er provides sample tube " to patients," patients spit saliva into the test tube and then send the test tube, and will receive results later. The UK NHS announced it is experimenting a home program to detect suspected cases, which would eliminate the risk of infection with others while travelling to hospital and the risk that patients must disinfect ambulances after using an ambulance. Health care professionals can take appropriate precautions to take appropriate precautions to extract samples while carrying out-off-off-19 cases.
The Free-off testing center has helped south korea conduct faster and widest tests than other countries. In Germany, the National Association of legal health insurance physicians said on December 2 that non-hospitalized institutions are capable of about 12,000 tests a day, and 10,700 tests have been tested last week.
If tests are conducted at the request of a doctor, the cost is covered by health insurance.
The Director of the Robert Koch Institute of Germany said Germany's total detection capability is 160,000 per week.
As of December 19, free car tests have been provided in multiple major cities.
As of December 2020, 3, the total number of tests conducted in Germany is not known as only the number of positive results were reported.
An initial lab survey revealed that a total of 483,295 samples (including week 12 of 2020) had been tested and 33,491 samples were detected as of week 12 6.9 %) SARS-Cov-2 POSITIVE. Researchers in Israel, technion and rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for simultaneous detection of 64 patient samples, that is a combined sample, and further tests only when the combined sample is found positive. In Wuhan, Huadae (Bgi) temporarily established a 2000 Square Meter Emergency testing laboratory called " fire eye which was put into operation on December 5, 2020 and can handle 10,000 per day. Multiple samples.
The lab was built in 5 DAYS UNDER WANG JIAN, founder Wang Jian, and modeling shows that if the above detection capability was not achieved, the cases in hubei would be 47 % higher and the corresponding processing isolation costs. It will double too.
Following the wuhan lab, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and shanghai instantly established fire eye labs, currently 12 cities in China.
As of January 4, 2020, the total daily flux of lab testing was 50,000 per day. Open Source, Multi-way design released by Origami Assays, allows covid19 test for up to 1122 patient samples by just 93 tests. These balanced designs can run in small labs without automatic Liquid remover.
As of January, shortage and shortage of reagents have become obstacles to mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States.
This LED some sponsors to explore sample preparation schemes that involve heating samples to 98Â°C (208Â°F) to 5 minutes to release the rna genome for further detection. The United Arab Emirates announced on December 31 that it has now undergone new corovirus tests for more of its population than any other country and is expanding its testing levels to allow large numbers of people to be tested pm
The way to achieve this detection capability is by using drive-through testing and funding for group 42 and hua big Gene (based on its "fire eye" emergency testing laboratory in China) high flux lab for crowd testing demand.
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR Tests every day, and is the world's first lab of its size to operate outside China.
China, France, Germany, China, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different detection methods for various parts of the corovirus gene mapping.
The World Health organization has adopted Germany's method of producing test kits, sending test kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kit.
Germany's methodology has been announced on January 1, 2020; the program developed by the CDC is only available after January 28, limiting testing in the United States ability. China and the United States both faced problems with the reliability of test boxes early in the outbreak, both countries and Australia are unable to provide enough test boxes to meet demand and health expert s' recommendations.
Instead, experts believe extensive testing in South Korea can help reduce the spread of the new corona virus.
Thanks to the testing capability established by the south korean government over the past few years, it is mainly concentrated in private sector labs.
On December 16, the world health organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow down the covid-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to high demand for testing, causing hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private labs, and the supply of wipes and chemical reagents is starting to straining.
In December 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test kit.
In The United States, testing kit developed by CDC has " flaws and the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that hinder private laboratory testing. Spain purchased test boxes from the Chinese company shenzhen iri biotechnology co. Ltd. Found that the test results are inaccurate.
The company explains that the inaccurate test results could be caused by incorrect collection of samples or incorrectly using the test kit.
The Spanish cabinet said it would be recycled back to the wrong results and replace it with another one provided by shenzhen bioeasy. 80 % of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China were incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1200 million test boxes from China and found inaccurate.
Prime Minister matoviÄ suggested these test boxes should be thrown into the danube. AteÅkara of turkey's ministry of health said the test boxes purchased from China was " very high " and did not " put them into use ". Britain purchased 3500 million test boxes from China, these test boxes were declared unavailable in April 2020
Positive results can be achieved by testing and isolating people who are positive and tracking the exposure of SARS-Cov-2 positive people.
Researchers working in the Italian city of vÃ³ (the first covid-19 patient died) conducted two rounds of tests for a total of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
About half of them tested positive and symptomatic, and all cases found were segregated.
New infections have been completely eliminated by taking travel restrictions on the community.
Through Mass tracking of contacts, restricting entry travel, detection and isolation, the 2020 Corona virus is slower in Singapore than other developed countries / regions, and Singapore has not taken extreme restrictions such as mandatory close restaurants and retail outlets.
Singapore cancelled many activities and residents are advised to stay at home on January 28, but schools resume classes on 23 after the holidays.
Several other countries / regions, such as Ireland and South Korea, have also curbed the epidemic of the disease through mass tracking contacts, restrictions on entry travel, detection and isolation, and less radical blockades.
A statistic study found that countries with the higher the number of deaths, the lower case mortality rates are detected, possibly because those countries are better able to detect only minor symptoms or asymptoms.
Who suggested countries that have no testing capability and National Labs Deal with covid-19 experience, sending their first five positive and first ten negative covid-19 samples to 16 who participated validation tests are performed by one of the lab.
Of these 16 reference labs, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 IN NORTH AMERICA AND 1 in Australia pm
In the chart below, " testing positive %" list is affected by the country's testing policies.
In other cases of the same conditions, countries that only test hospitalized residents have a higher rate than those that test all citizens, whether they appear symptoms or not.
Cumulative rates of the EU / European economic area and the UK increased rapidly between 1 to 15 January 2020
Cumulative rates of new corovirus disease (Covid-19) shows similar trends in EU / European economic area countries and in the UK, confirming that while different countries are at different stages, Covid-19 the pandemic is growing rapidly.
According to Italian experience, the state, hospitals and ICU all need to be better prepared for the surge in covid-19 patients, with a particularly heavy task.
Multiple cases of pneumonia were reported in wuhan, China's hubei province on December 31, 2019
On December 9, 2020, the CDC reported that pathogen is a new type of corona virus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-Cov-2
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 infections has been named Corona Disease (Covid-19).
Evidence so far suggests that about 80 % of covid-19 cases are minor disorders, i.e. respiratory infections accompanied or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14 % of cases, Covid-19 will progress in serious illness and require hospitalization, while the remaining 6 % of cases progresses to critical condition and require serious care.
The death rate of patients hospitalized for covid-19 is about 4 %.
In this study, we assessed the trends of cumulative prevalence rates in the EU / European Union, EU / European economic area, eea, as well as the UK (UK) rates of covid-19 China's hubei province made comparisons.
We also compared the existing number of covid-19 cases in EU / eea countries and the UK from 31 to 15 January 2020 in Italy.
EU / eea countries and UK Covid-19 cases
Following China, the geographic distribution of covid-19 has expanded further, and the dynamic changes in the covid-19 epidemic in other parts of the world are similar to China.
On December 3, 2020, the director-General of the world health organization (who) declared covid-19 a pandemic.
In The European Surveillance Magazine, published on January 2020, 3, spiteri and others reported the first confirmed covid-19 cases in Europe based on who's Case definition.
In EU / Eea, France reported the earliest three confirmed cases on December 2020, 1, 24, returning nationals of wuhan city, China's hubei province.
Covid-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU / eea countries and the UK as of January 2020, 2019 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported on December 15, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported in Italy alone.
GET CUMULATIVE NUMBER AND CUMULATIVE RATES OF COVID-19 cases
The European centers for disease control (Ecdc) updates the number of covid-19 cases reported in each country every country around the globe obtained only through official sources such as health ministries, National and regional health authorities and who.
The data has been used to evaluate EU / eea and UK Covid-19 trends and compare them with Italy.
We calculate 14 days of interceptions cumulative rates for each EU / eea country and covid-19 cases in the UK between 1 to 15 January 2020 as an indicator of prevalence of active covid-19 cases in order to consider the natural course of covid-19
We also provide the cumulative total number of cases reported in each country as of 8:00 am on January 3, 2020, as of January 31 data in Italy were compared for the period 15
EU / eea countries and UK Covid-19 trends
The trend of 14-day intercepted cumulative rates in EU / eea countries and the UK's Covid-19 cases overall is consistent with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For EU / eea and the UK as a whole, the cumulative rate of covid-19 has increased since around 21 January 2020 and then dramatically increased around 28 (supplements) material).
This is mainly due to a rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU / eea countries, as well as covid-19 in the UK, showed a similar growth trend (supplements).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of covid-19 cases in EU / eea countries and the UK from 31 to 15 January 2020, and with Italy comparisons are made.
It is important to stress that as of 8:00 am on January 15, 15 other EU / eea countries and the UK have reported in less than 3 weeks total number of cases.
Our results show that the number of covid-19 cases reported by EU / eea and the UK is rapidly increasing.
The observed cumulative rate trend in covid-19 shows that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, national public health responses vary, the definition of cases may differ from country and used to choose must undergo covid-19 diagnostic tests - including additional tests -- patients the program differs, but the same.
Around 10 % of covid-19 patients needed serious care, according to doctors in the affected regions of Italy in early January 2020, while media reports said hospitals and critical care in these areas the ward has reached its maximum capacity.
At the EU / eea level, the data currently available are only 6 % and 1 % of covid-19 cases admitted to ICU (data not shown).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic way to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of critical care and mid-term care beds available in European countries ranged from 29.2 to 100 in Germany Portugal'S 4.2 pieces vary.
This means countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and mid-term care beds per 100 million people in 2010-2011).
Ecdc's sixth update to covid-19 rapid risk assessment modeled scenarios related to health care capacity saturation, and prevalence and hospitalized covid-19 patients in each EU / eea country and UK the risk of overweight custody bed &gt; 90 % relationship is estimated.
Since cases have so far gathered in EU / eea countries and certain areas of UK, and hospitals and icu usually serve the population covered populations in identified areas, it is preferably in "Standard Statistics Geographic Unit 2" (Nuts-2) level provides information on cases and critical care beds.
The Italian experience and current trends in other countries suggest that the EU / eea and the UK's Covid-19 epidemic is growing rapidly.
Therefore, the state, hospitals and ICU should be prepared to respond to the ongoing community spread of SARS-Cov-2 and the increase in the number of covid-19 patients in need of medical care, especially in critical care, for example, what happens in the affected regions of Italy.
As the recent ecdc rapid risk assessment points out, a quick, positive and comprehensive approach is crucial to slowing the spread of SARS-Cov-2, and needs to move from curb to relief because, if not implemented early, the rapid growth in the number of cases may be expected let policymakers and hospitals don't have enough time to understand, accept and adjust the response.
The Rapid Risk Assessment Also lists public health measures to alleviate the effects of the pandemic.
There is now a short window of opportunity that countries may further step up control to slow sars-Cov-2 spread and relieve stress on the health care system.
Otherwise, other EU / eea countries's healthcare systems are likely to face a surge in need of serious care in the coming days or weeks.
The Origin of human coronary virus
Mutation and adaptability have propelled the co-evolution of coronaviruses, cov and its host (including humans) for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two types of human corona virus (Hcov) were known to cause minor diseases such as common cold.
Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome, mers, turning the situation, reveals the devastating and deadly nature of hcov infections.
Sars-Cov-2, which appeared in Central China at the end of 2019, once again made cov the focus of attention, surprisingly, compared to its sister virus SARS-Cov, but pathogenic low sex.
Hcov infection is a common disease in humans and animals, so understanding the origin of hcov's common disease will help us.
Most hcov come from bat and are non-pathogenic.
Some Hcov's intermediate storage hosts are also known.
Identifying animal hosts is of direct significance to preventing human diseases.
Studying the interaction of cov hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of human cov.
In this review, we outlines the existing knowledge of seven types of hcov, highlighting their history of discovery, the origins of common disease, and inter-species transmission.
Importantly, we compared and contrast different hcov from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombinations.
Against this backdrop, we explore the current outbreak of 2019 Covid-19 Covid-19
In addition, this article also focuses on the requirements for successful completion of host conversion and the impact of viral evolution on the seriousness of disease.
Cov belongs to the corovirus division, composed of a group of justice single-chain rna viruses with mask.
These viruses have the largest genome of rna viruses, containing 2.6 to 32 million alkaline bases, known as "Cov" (Cov) for being cov for being coroneath an electron microscope.
Structurally, cov has non-segmented genomes that share similar tissue.
About Two thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (orf1a and orf1b) that are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replica polymer.
These polymers are further processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins called nsp1~ 16.
The rest of the genome consists of orf of structural proteins, including stabbing (s), Mask (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (n).
Many Genealogy-specific auxiliary proteins are also cov of different genealogy.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, cov is divided into four genes (a-Cov, Beta-Cov, Gamma-Cov and Delta-Cov), in which the beta-Cov contains most hcov and subdivided into four genealogy (a, b), c and d).
System Development evidence suggests that bats and rodents are genes for most a-Cov and beta-Cov, while birds are the main hosts of Gamma-Cov and Delta-Cov.
For thousands of years, cov has been crossing species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
So far, 7 types of corona virus (Hcov) are known to be infected with people.
Among them, Hcov-229 e and hcov-Nl63 Are Alpha-Cov.
5 other beta-Cov include hcov-Oc43, Hcov-Hku1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cov (SARS-Cov), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Cov and SARS-Cov-2.
Hcov-229 e, Hcov-Oc43, Hcov-hku1 and hcov-nl63 typically cause minor symptoms such as common cold and / or diarrhea.
By contrast, SARS-Cov, Mers-Cov and newly discovered sars-Cov-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in relatively more patients and more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute response distress syndrome, ards) and lung performance.
In the mid-20 s, the first hcov-229 e virus strain b814 was separated from the nasal secretion of ordinary cold patients.
Since then, humans have accumulated more knowledge through extensive research on both hcov-229 e and hcov-oc43 viruses that can cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the sars outbreak, the notion that hcov was usually harmless had been widely accepted.
The outbreak of sars in 2003 was one of the most destructive events in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude death rate of about 10 %.
Ten years later, the outbreak of middle east breathing syndrome (Mers) continues to spread across the Arabian Peninsula and sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
2019 new hcov virus (2019-Ncov, later renamed SARS-Cov-2) is a continuing epidemic of 2019 Covid-2020 Covid-19 more than 3,120 lives were taken on January 3 and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm has gone off, and the globe must be ready for the upcoming SARS-Cov-2 epidemic.
All 7 types of hcov have a common origin of human and animals from bat, rats, or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence suggests that all hcov evolution originated in bat, which are well adaptable, non-pathogenic, but shows great genetic diversity.
The Covid-19 epidemic poses huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Tracing Hcov's co-disease origins provide the framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and restrictions of viral species jumping.
In addition, it will guide or boost the search for SARS-Cov-2 Storage Hosts, intermediate host and expand animal hosts, which is important in preventing future virus spills.
In this review, we outlines the origins, Inter-species transmission and pathogenesis of hcov's common disease.
In particular, we highlighted and explored a common topic, that hcov's parent virus is usually not pathogenic in its natural storage host, but is pathogenic after cross species spread to new host.
In addition, we look back at the trend of hcov evolution, in which an increase in spreadability is often accompanied by a decline in pathogenicity.
Against this backdrop, we also discussed the results of the ongoing sars-Cov-2 Outbreak.
Animal Cov has been widely known since the late 20 s.
Before Hcov-229 E Strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretion of common cold patients, medical scientists had been among various infected animals (including turkey, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs) different covs are separated from the middle.
Over the last few decades, 7 Hcov have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of hcov discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) will provide us with abundant information and guidance.
In 1966, the first hcov-229 e strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection and then adapted to growth in wi-38 lung cell strains.
Patients infected with hcov-229 e have common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort, throat pain, and 10 % of patients have fever, cough, etc.
In the second half of 1967, Hcov-oc43 was separated from organ culture and subsequent successive generations of the brain of mice.
The clinical features of hcov-oc43 infections are similar to hcov-229 e infections and are not much different in symptoms compared to other respiratory pathogens such as influenza a and nasal virus.
Hcov-229 e and hcov-oc43 are distributed globally, mainly in winter in temperate climate.
Usually, the two viruses incubation period is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks later.
A human volunteer study shows that healthy individuals infected hcov-229 e experience a mild common cold.
Only a handful of patients with low immune function show severe lower respiratory infections.
Sars, also known as " Atypical Pneumonia is the first fully documented pandemic in human history by hcov, whose pathogen is SARS-Cov, the third discovered hcov.
The first sars case dates back to China's Guangdong Province in late 2002
Sars Outbreak LED to 8,096 reported cases, 774 dead and spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to super spreads, it is estimated that each case may bring about 2 further cases, incubation period of 4 TO 7 days, with a peak viral load on day 10 of onset.
Patients infected with SARS-Cov initially showed muscular pain, headache, fever, discomfort and chill, followed by terminal symptoms such as breathing difficulties, cough and breathing distress.
Reducing Lymphocytes, abnormal liver function and elevated kinase are common lab tests in sars.
In addition, diffusing alveolar injuries, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in sars patients.
About 20-30 % of patients then needed serious care and mechanical ventilation.
Among these seriously ill patients, multiple organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected, often accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal in patients with low immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working on hcov research.
Hcov-nl63 was separated from a 7-Month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004
The virus was initially found to flow amongst toddlers, seniors and immune-impaired patients suffering from respiratory disorders
Among diseases caused by Hcov-Nl63, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis are common.
Another independent study shows that the same virus was isolated from specimens of a 8-Month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.
Hcov-nl63 is estimated to account for about 4.7 % of common respiratory diseases, with peak in early summer, spring and winter.
Hcov-nl63 is associated with obstructive larynglub laryngrub larynitis.
In the same year, Hcov-hku1 was separated from a 71-Year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and microbronchitis.
In addition to community access to sexual pneumonia and bronchitis, Hcov-hku1 has been reported to be linked to acute asthma attacks.
Similar to hcov-Nl63, Hcov-229 e, Hcov-Oc43, Hcov-hku1 has been detected worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these four communities have well adapted to humans and are often less likely to mutations that cause high pathogenic diseases. But there have also been accidents for unknown reasons, such as a more toxic subtype of hcov-Nl63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Often, when these hcov gain the ability to effectively spread and survive within the human body, their toxicity or pathogenicity is reduced.
Mers-Cov was first separated from a 60-Year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia for the first time in 2012
Although most laboratory diagnosed cases come from the middle east, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary sexual transmission to close contacts.
In 2015, further sexual transmission erupted again in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
Mers's clinical performance is similar to sars, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike Sars, many mers patients also suffered from acute renal failure, a unique feature of mers from hcov-induced diseases so far.
More than 30 % of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vom
As of December 2, more than 2500 confirmed cases reported in the lab, with a death rate of up to 34.4 percent, making mers-Cov the most destructive virus known to humans one.
People with aggregate pneumonia were detected in wuhan city, China's hubei province in late mid-12, China's hubei province, linked to SARS-Cov-2 infection.
The World Health Organization declares the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-Cov-2 is a public health incident of international concern and named the disease covid-19.
As of December 2020, 90,053, 3 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude death rate of 3.4 %.
It is noteworthy that the disease death rate is 4.2 % in hubei, China, while in regions outside hubei is 1.2 %.
Like Sars-Cov and mers-Cov, SARS-Cov-2 can cause severe respiratory infections, manifested by fever, cough and difficulties in breathing.
Some patients also suffer from diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the worst symptoms that can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although Sars-COV AND SARS-Cov-2 are very similar due to 82 % of the homology of high-nucleotide sequences, they cluster into different branches in the system development trees.
Sars-Cov-2 is significantly lower than SARS-Cov and mers-Cov-Cov, but more contagious.
Sars-Cov-2 Asymptomatic infections are reported, which may have accelerated the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
Comparing Sars-Cov-2 WITH 6 other hcov types, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of hcov disease are very similar.
On this point, SARS-Cov-2 is in line with the overall trend of 6 other hcov.
Second, the degree of covid-19 symptoms ranges between SARS-Cov and 4 Community-acquired hcov (i.e. Hcov-229 e, Hcov-Oc43, Hcov-hku1 and hcov-Nl63).
On the one hand, SARS-Cov-2 infections are more common in community-acquired hcov infections, including non-specific, mild and even symptomatic expressions.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe covid-19 cases are also found in SARS-Cov infections, albeit slightly lower.
Third, SARS-Cov-2 spread also shows interesting patterns of community access to sex hcov and SARS-Cov.
On the one hand, SARS-Cov-2 is at least as high as community access to hcov.
On the other hand, whether sars-Cov-2'S-2 will decline after human transmission, LIKE SARS-Cov and mers-Cov remains to be verified.
Finally, like other hcov, SARS-Cov-2. Can be detected in poop samples.
At least in some cases, whether sars-Cov-mouth transmission plays an important role as in SARS-Cov, remains to be clarified from future research.
It is also important to see if sars-Cov-2 is as seasonal as community access to hcov.
However, SARS-Cov-2 features such as the spread, pathogenesis and continuous transmission from generation will have a significant impact on the ultimate fate of the current covid-19 epidemic.
All 4 communities that cause minor symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have adapted well to these 4 Hcov.
In other words, both sides could be survivors of the ancient hcov epidemic.
Hcov, which caused severe human disease and those suffering from severe hcov disease have died.
For this reason, hcov must be replicated enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations to combat host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic persists, the more people infected, the greater the likelihood that it will be adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, its spread among humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infections control measures.
Over the years, these 4 communities have been spreading across the population, leading to common cold in people with normal immune function.
These viruses don't need animal hosts.
By contrast, the highly pathogenic sars-Cov and mers-Cov have not adapted well to humans and cannot spread among humans.
They need to survive and reproduce among human and animal disease host, and may find opportunities to spread to vulnerable human goals through one or more intermediate hosts and expanding host.
Sars-Cov-2 features similar to SARS-Cov / Mers-Cov and 4 community access hcov.
It is as highly contagious as community-acquired hcov, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community access to hcov, less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or mers-Cov.
It remains to be seen whether it can adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a host or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of hcov, it is a guide to us to discuss the definition and features of hcov's evolving host, natural host, storage hosts, intermediate host and expanding host.
If an animal has closely related ancestors that are highly homology at the level of a nuclear otide sequence, the animal will become an evolving host of hcov.
Ancestral viruses are usually adaptable and pathogenic in this host.
Also, storage hosts carry hcov on a long term basis.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of hcov or its parent virus.
By contrast, if hcov just parasitic in the middle host or immediately parasitic in the human body, it will not be well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a common source of human infections in humans and livestock, and play the role of zooming the host by allowing the virus to replicate briefly and then spread it to humans to humans to expand the scale of human infections.
If hcov cannot maintain its spread within the middle host, terminal infection can occur.
Instead, hcov can adapt to intermediate hosts and even build long-term locality.
In this case, the middle host becomes natural storage host.
A Retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that sars index cases have a history of exposure to hunting animals.
The subsequent seropositive rate survey showed that animal vendors had a higher level of immunoglobulin g (Igg) than the general population.
In the living animal market, the fruit Beaver (flour) and a beaver cat were first found carrying sars-Cov-like viruses almost identical to the SARS-Cov virus.
The fact that there are no further sars reports after clearing all the beavers in the market indirectly supports this view.
However, reports allege that the testing of SARS-Cov by farm beaver in wild or uncontacted living animal markets is basically negative, suggesting that the fruit beaver may be just the middle zoom host rather than the natural host of SARS-Cov.
It is noteworthy that since 80 % of the different animals on the GUANGZHOU MARKET HAVE SARS-Cov antibodies, it is not ruled out that multiple small mammals could also act as well as SARS-Cov Intermediate.
All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-Cov.
A subsequent study of SARS-Cov natural animal hosts found a closely related bat corona virus known as SARS-Linked Bat Corona Virus Hku3 (Sarsr-RH-Batcov Hku3), which survives in chinabata inside the body.
These bats are positive for SARS-Cov antibodies and sarsr-RH-Batcov Hku3's genome sequences.
The virus and other bat corona virus has 88-92 % of the nuclear sequences homology with SARS-Cov.
These studies lay the groundwork for a new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
In addition, researchers have identified multiple SARS-like cov (SL-Cov) from bats, but none of the virus can be separated as live viruses except for a designated wiv1.
Human Angiotensin Converter Enzyme 2 (ace2) is known as the receptor of SARS-Cov.
Experiments show that wiv1 extracted from bat poop samples uses bats, Beaver and human ace2 as its receptors into cells.
It's interesting that serum from sars recovery patients can neutralize wiv1.
By far, wiv1 is the closest ancestor to BAT SARS-Cov, with 95 % homology of nuclear otide sequences.
Although the two viruses are highly homogeneous, wiv1 is usually thought to be the DIRECT PARENT VIRUS OF SARS-Cov, and the bat is not the direct storage host of SARS-Cov.
System Development analysis categorizes mers-Cov as bat cov-Hku4 And Bat Cov-hku5
Bat Cov-hku4 and mers-Cov invade the virus using the same host receptor dipeptides enzyme 4 (dpp4).
Mers-Cov's rna dependent rna polymerase sequence is closer to its counterparts in bat beta-Cov from Europe and Africa.
So far, no living mers-Cov has been found inside wild bat.
Mers-Cov has only 87 % homology with its closest bat cov-hku25
Therefore, bat may not be the direct storage host of mers-Cov.
On the other hand, studies in the middle east show that monoca is positive for mers-Cov-Cov-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to camels from several african countries.
Living Mers-Cov isolated from the swab of the swab is the same as the human body, further indication that the camel is the real storage host of mers-Cov.
It is also important to note that among camels experimenting mers-Cov, the general symptoms are mild, but a large number of viruses have been observed.
It is noteworthy that infected camels not only spread the virus through respiratory tract, but also through the dung mouth, but the dung pathway is also the main way for bat to release the virus.
However, the problem remains because many mers diagnosed cases have no history of contact with camels before symptoms arise, which may be attributed to human-person-to-to-to-person or unknown pathways of transmission, including unrecognized animal species carrying mers-Cov.
Sars-Cov-2 has a 96.2 % nucleotide homology with the bat cov ratg13 separated from the Chamomile Bat.
As in the case of SARS-Cov and mers-Cov, the sequences between SARS-Cov-2 and ratg13 are too big to determine a parent-Generation Relationship.
In other words, unless almost identical bat corovirus is found in the future, bat may not be the direct storage host of SARS-Cov-2
Presumably, the middle animal host of SARS-Cov-2 should be sold and slaughtered at South China's seafood wholesale market, many of the original covid-19 cases are linked, suggesting the possibility of animals to animals to-to-2 human spreading events.
Several recent studies based on macro genome sequencing suggest that an endangered small mammammammal known as panga (Malay Panga) may also carry the ancestors associated with SARS-Cov-Cov.
These new pangerine corovirus genomes are homology with SARS-Cov-2 % of the nucleotide sequences.
But they are just as closely related to ratg13, with about 90 % homology at the nuclear sequence level.
Among the system development trees, they are classified as two sars-Cov-2 Virus Sublines, one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) TO SARS-Cov-2 and has 97.4 % of amino acid sequences homology.
In Stark contrast, SARS-Cov-2 and ratg13 differ rbd, despite higher sequences of the whole genome.
An earlier study on sick pangles also reported the detection of viral overlung samples, with a similar relationship to SARS-Cov-2
The study employs different assembling methods and manual treatments and obtained parts of the genome sequences that make up about 86.3 % of the virus genome.
We can't rule out the possibility that pangler is one of the middle animal hosts of SARS-Cov-2
However, due to the differences in the beta-Cov sequences associated with the PANGLIA SARS-Cov-2, there is no evidence that SARS-Cov-2 is directly from the pangerture.
In addition, the distance between SARS-Cov-2 and ratg13 is even shorter than the beta-Cov-Cov associated with SARS-2
Sars-Cov-2 evolution pathways in bats, pangles and other mammals are still to be determined.
While the highest sequence homology has been found in RBD BETWEEN SARS-Cov-2 and the pangliance, the SARS-Cov-2 related beta-Cov-Cov-2 and ratg13 have the highest the whole genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculated that the high resemblance between the PANGERNAIL SARS-Cov-Cov-2 related beta-Cov-2 is caused by selective convergence evolution.
Another opposing view is that the PANGERPILLAR SARS-Cov-2 related beta-Cov and ratg13 are reunited in a third wildlife species.
As a driving force of evolution, reorganization is widely present in beta-Cov.
There is no decision on the origins of the direct human and animal disease of SARS-Cov-2
In addition to highly pathogenic hcov, researchers also studied the common origins of hcov-229 e, Hcov-Oc43, Hcov-nl63 and hcov-Hcov-hku1
System Development evidence suggests that hcov-nl63 and hcov-229 e may have originated from the bat cov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 parent viruses have also been detected in rodents.
Reports say the discovery in North American Tricolor Bat called arcov. 2 (Apalachian Ridge Cov)'s bat corona virus shows a close connection to hcov-nl63
On the other hand, Hcov-229 e has a genetic link to another type of bat corovirus found in Ghana, known as hipposideros / Ghanakwam / 19/2008, and camel animals are suspected to be the host pm
For the sake of clarity, figure 1 AND TABLE 2 summarize existing knowledge about the animal origins of known hcov.
System Development analysis provides evidence of historical interspecies transmission of hcov.
Around 1890, when hcov-oc43 infects humans from cross-species of livestock, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.
The history of inter-seed transmission of hcov-229 e is unclear.
The Bat A-Cov, closely associated with hcov-229 e, has been discovered.
An alpaca a-Cov appeared between the two.
There's multiple evidence supporting the virus spreading directly from bat to humans.
First, humans, not alpaca, may be in touch with bat in common eco-location.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, the bat a-Cov associated with hcov-229 e is diverse and non-pathogenic in bat, while alpaca a-Cov causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca a-Cov was not found in wildlife.
Therefore, the possibility that alpaca will receive hcov-229 E-related a-Cov from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses including rabies, Ebola, nipa and hendra virus.
Therefore, it's not surprising that bats spread hcov-229 e directly to humans.
Or, although bat a-Cov Acts as a gene bank of hcov-229 e, alpaca and monoca may be intermediate host of spreading the virus to humans, exactly the case with mers-Cov.
Mers-Cov is a good illustration of the spread of species from bat to single-Peaks and from single-Peaks to humans.
Bat's Mers-Cov evolution origins were known in their initial identification, and subsequent discoveries reinforced this argument.
Apparently, bat provides a rich pool of viral species for interplant exchange and spread of gene fragments.
Longevity and intensive groups, close social interaction and strong flying capability are all favorable conditions for bats to become the ideal " virus spreads
On the other hand, Mers-Cov has been inside the single-Peaks for decades.
It's well adapted to these camels, and the camels have gone from middle host to stable natural storage host.
Mers-Cov causes very slight disease in these animals and remains relatively low mutation rates.
Its sporadic spread to humans is an accident, and since it is not sustainable, humanity remains the terminal host of mers-Cov.
Compared to the role of camels in the spread of mers-Cov-Cov-2 is different, if any, compared to the role of camels in the spread of mers-Cov.
In particular, pangles beta-Cov is highly pathogenic in pangles.
They may be terminal hosts of SARS-Cov-2 related beta-Cov, similar to the beaver in SARS-Cov.
Several possibilities for SARS-Cov-2 spread from animals to humans must be identified or ruled out in future research.
First, the bat may be the storage host of SARS-Cov-2-2-related viruses almost identical to SARS-Cov-2
Humans may share eco-location with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Second, the pangler could be one of the middle-expanded host of the NEW SARS-Cov-2 related viruses.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating wild flavors.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2.
There is a need to conduct antibody research on livestock and wildlife.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-Cov-2 may be reorganized and adapted in a third species that has been exposed to bat and pangles.
Research on the origins of SARS-Cov-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal hosts, three major factors in the virus play an important role in promoting corona virus across interspecies barriers.
First, they have higher mutation rates in rna replication.
Compared to other single-chain rna viruses, the mutation rate of corona virus is estimated to be "Medium to" High with an average replacement rate of 2 per spot 10-4 per year, according to the adaptation phase of corona virus to new host. Time.
The Corona virus has proofing activity, deleting it can lead to very high variability and decay and even survive.
Interestingly, known nuclear side analog redsivir can inhibit coronary virus replication by inhibiting this RNA EXTRACT AND RNA-dependent rna polymerase.
Redsiway is one of the most promising anti-SARS-Cov-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of corona virus is about 1000 times higher than its host.
Also, if the corona virus doesn't fit well to the host, its mutation rate is usually high.
Sars-Cov-2 mutation rate is significantly lower than SARS-Cov with a high mutation rate, suggesting that it is more adaptability to humans.
Presumably, it has adapted to another kind of close to humanity.
In addition to SARS-Cov-2, this also applies to the mers-Cov that suited to the single-Peaks.
In Theory, genetic drifting is unlikely to rapidly invalidate vaccines and antivirus targeting SARS-Cov-2
Second, the larger rna genome in corona virus has additional plasticity in gene mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the possibility of interspecies coevolution, which is beneficial to the emergence of new corona virus when conditions fit.
The Large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions towards genome 3 ' end coding provide proof.
Third, Corona Virus Switches Templates randomly and frequently through a unique "copy selection" mechanism during rna replication.
Chain Exchange happens frequently during cov rna transcription as host of mixed containers.
Highly homologous full length and subgenomic rna can be recombining to produce new corona.
Evidence of natural restructuring of system development has been found in hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 and animal corona viruses such as bat SL-Cov and bat cov-hku9
Virus related to spreading - host interactions
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction between the virus and host receptors is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
This article uses Sars-Cov's reorganization as a typical example, showing evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparison of isolated strains of human and fruits sars-Cov, researchers believe SARS-Cov can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially by mutations of s PROTEIN RBD.
Usually, rbd in corona s protein interacts with cell receptors and is closely screened by host antibody reaction.
In Sars-Cov, rbd is located in the 318th to 510th amino acids in the s1 clip, which combines with people ace2 and its co-receptors to enable the virus into the virus.
Sars-Cov's rbd can identify ace2 receptors of various animals, including bat, Beaver, rats, mice and beaver cats, thus making the virus spread between species.
In fact, ONLY 6 Amino acid residues have been observed in rbd with separate strain rbd, of which 4 of them are located in the receptor bonding with ace2 receptors.
K479n and s487t mutations exist in the RBD OF FRUIT BEAVER SARS-Cov, which may increase the affinity of fiber protein interact with human ace2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids could be crucial for the virus adapting to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-Cov-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-Cov.
The difference between SARS-Cov-2 AND SARS-Cov in the s protein s1 unit is 30 %, which means that their bond of s protein and human ace2 may change.
Indeed, a refrigerated electroscopy study shows that the bond is 10 to 20 times more affinity between people ace2 and SARS-Cov s protein.
It would also make sense to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed in SARS-Cov-2 spread.
Interestingly, Hcov-nl63 also combines with ace2, but with different parts of s.
In addition, there are many other hcov receptors such as hcov-229 e amino peptides n and hcov-Oc43'S 9-O-acetylated saliva acid.
They may also explain why the above-mentioned corovirus successfully adapted to humans after spreading across species from animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of hcov transmission are also influenced by other host dependencies and restrictive factors.
The differences between these host proteins in humans and natural hosts of hcov such as bat, single-Peaks and rodents may pose an obstacle to inter-species transmission.
Hcov must deprive hosts of dependency and break host restrictions to achieve successful interplant transmission.
In this regard, the molecular deciding factor in the important area of viral-host interaction remains to be identified and represented.
Impartial all genome screening of SARS-Cov-2 host dependencies and restrictive factors using the latest crispr technology could bear fruit
The appearance of a new hcov: back to origin
The Diversity of the bat corona virus offers ample opportunities for the emergence of a new hcov.
In this sense, the bat crown virus serves as hcov's gene pool.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene recombinations are also drivers of hcov evolution and two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes could revolutionize the virus's phenotype.
In Sars-Cov assisted proteins, orf8 is considered important for adapting humans due to isolation of SARS-Cov-Cov-related batviruses, but found that they can code different orf8 proteins.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide missing features of SARS-Cov were found in isolated strains.
This lack divides orf8 into orf8a and orf8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes host conversion.
In addition, SARS-Cov may have been reorganized with Alpha-and Gamma-Cov Genealogy, in which a large number of smaller recombinations have been found in RNA-dependent rna polymerase.
Reorganization sites have also been found in nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of the nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the mers-Cov epidemic has experienced a reorganization of different genealogy, which occurred in Saudi Arabia's single-Peaks.
In addition to SARS-Cov and mers-Cov, reorganization incidents were also observed in other hcov, where hcov and other animal corona virus recombine in their unstructured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can lead to unexpected changes in the virus genome, most likely to relieving the selective pressure imposed by the virus, among others, the host immune system.
An example of these functions is that in the hcov-229 e prototype strain which the lack of double nucleotides leads to the loss of full length orf4.
Although the complete orf4 can be observed in the hcov-229 E-related bat and camel virus, alpaca alpaca-Cov shows a single nucleotide insertion, causing a mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new hcov is also driven by pressure of storage host s' choice.
Asymptoms or only minor symptoms have been detected after the bat infected with the corona virus and bat.
From an anatomy and physiologic point of view, bat seems to adapt well to the corona virus.
For example, the defects in bat provocative response effectively reduce pathologic changes caused by coronary virus.
In addition, bat's natural killing cell activity is inhibited due to positive regulation of inhibitory nkg2 / cd94 and lower expression levels of main tissue compatibility complex i molecules.
Moreover, high levels of active oxygen (Ros) produced by bat's high metabolic activity can inhibit coronary virus replication, but also influence proofing through RNA Extract Enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the high pathogenicity of viral strains entering the new host
More pathogenic corovirus strains may also evolve through reorganization, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein features to suit the host.
It is therefore no accident that three new hcov emerged over the last two decades.
Corona virus does not cause disease or cause minor symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.
They are replicating in large numbers without causing a strong host immune response.
This is why there are asymptomatic carriers and cases of severe human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of immune response and cytokine storms, the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung injury will be.
In contrast, among symptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from corona replication.
The same strategy to unchain immune response may have a positive role in anti-SARS-Cov-2 treatments.
Interferon in bats are particularly strong.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of human SARS-Cov-2 infection.
In addition, nlrp3 inflammatory body activation in bat also has flaws.
Based on this reasoning, using mc950 to inhibit nlrp3 inflammatory body may be useful for covid-19 treatment.
The appearance of SARS-Cov-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-Cov and mers-Cov were produced.
Although 95 % Nuclear-Cov has been found to be homology with SARS-Cov, there is a bat corona virus homology with SARS-Cov-2 %.
Although Beavers and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-Cov, the direct intermediate host of SARS-Cov-2 has not been identified.
The apparently same origin of the SARS-Cov has been discovered, which suggests that the pangler may be one of the middle hosts, or that the panglite beta-Cov may contribute to the final version of SARS-Cov-2
Despite doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-Cov-2 was made intentionally or unintentionally.
Due to the recent SARS-Cov-2 Outbreak, the corona virus is back into the spotlight.
Research into corona virus in bat and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the origins of hcov human and animal hosts in human transmission.
There is ample evidence that SARS-Cov, Mers-COV AND SARS-Cov-2 originated from bat and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since Sars-Cov infections stem from human contact with fruit beaver on the market, closing the wet market and killing beaver could effectively end the sars epidemic.
By the same token, in view of multiple genealogy of pangerals linked to SARS-Cov-Cov-2, pangles should be removed from the wet goods market to prevent the spread of human and animal disease.
But whether and how SARS-Cov-2 spread to humans through pangles and other mammals remains to be studied.
Mers-Cov, on the other hand, has been in the monoaks for a long time.
These camels are important transportation and are the main source of local people's meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely distributed in the middle east and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control mers, following the Chinese Wildlife Market To Prevent Sars-COV AND SARS-Cov-2
In order to stop the re-outbreak of mers, a comprehensive approach should be taken in conjunction with other infections control measures to develop an effective anti-Mers-Cov vaccine for camels.
As we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear, causing outbreaks.
Various people and animals have been infected with corona virus circulating in the wild environment.
In particular, there is a high diversity of bat corona virus with the potential for human and livestock.
These humans and animals have plenty of opportunities to evolve and reorganize, leading to a new corona virus that will become easier to spread and / or deadly in humans.
In some parts of China, the culture of edible wildlife should be eliminated in order to reduce unnecessary exposure between humans and animals.
After the severe test of sars, mers and covid-19, we should make better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have existed on earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural hosts until the chance of overflow.
While bats have many features that favour the virus transmission, if people are educated away from bat and other wild species, human exposure to bats and other wild species will be greatly reduced.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary in order to better understand the ecological condition of the corona virus and its natural host, which will prove very useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
In Short, the most effective way to prevent viral human and animal disease is to stay away from the ecological position of the natural host of human and animals.
The Mystery of the origin of SARS-Cov-Cov-2 remains a few missing.
First, if bats SPREAD AN ANCIENT SARS-Cov-2 virus to the pangles, it would be meaningful to look into what circumstances bat and pangles can share the same eco spot.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then how humans are in contact with bat remains to be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species including humans, bat and pangles.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, can be vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2, monitoring and experimental infections research should be conducted.
If it's bats, pangles or other mammals, SARS-Cov-2 or almost identical parent virus is expected to be found in natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this field will reveal how SARS-Cov-2 evolved in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human covid-19
