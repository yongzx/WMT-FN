The b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, helping to track close contacts and identifying individuals who may have come into contact with an infected person ("contacts").
Many applications have been developed or proposed in some regions and jurisdictions with the support of official governments.
Many frameworks have been established for building close contact tracking applications.
Privacy issues are also a concern, especially as some systems need to track the geographic location of application users.
Alternatives to less intrusive ones include using a Bluetooth signal to record the distance between users and other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate this Bluetooth-enabled feature directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has jointly developed an app that allows citizens to check for their own contact with COVID-19 patients.
The program is currently used in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by the local IT community, the app was released as open source software and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app, StopKorona!, to track exposure to potential infections and help medical institutions respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Health of Northern Macedonia.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the Close Contact Tracking Application was in the advanced stages of development and would be available in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are also planning similar applications ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on the TraceTogether application in Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geofence app for confirmed patients living in MOSCOW with COVID-19 to ensure that patients do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, cited some of the practical problems with the application system, including false positive false positives, and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small percentage of people used the application.
To prevent the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has placed restrictions on the types of organizations that can publish Coronavirus-related apps in the Apple App Store, i.e. only to "official" or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy activists say they are concerned about the use of coronavirus applications for large-scale surveillance, especially if surveillance infrastructure built in response to the coronavirus outbreak should be dismantled after the threat of an outbreak is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations announced eight conditions for government projects:
Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and monitoring expansion must have a "sunset" clause;
The data collected is for COVID-19 purposes only;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence that they are effectively protected;
Digital monitoring must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with third parties shall be defined in accordance with the law;
Safeguards must be provided to prevent data misuse and citizens must be provided with the right to respond to data misuse;
All "relevant stakeholders" are required to be "effectively involved", including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter Without Borders (RSF) have also released checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan is to address the issue of continuous monitoring and remove it from the device's operating system once it is no longer needed to track it.
In some countries, network-based rather than application-based location tracking is used, eliminating the need for users to download apps and avoiding being tracked.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to raw location data can have serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems that bring their own central servers require access to personal location data;
South Korea has introduced a system that is not application-based to perform contact tracking tasks.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine that information to send notifications to potential infected people via text message.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the government has been allowed to disclose location information because of major changes to information privacy laws in the country following the MERS outbreak.
The public has access to this information through many applications and websites. Other countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and privacy systems.
As of April 6, 2020, no details have been released.
Privacy Close Contact Tracking is a recognized concept, and a large number of relevant research literature dates back at least to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy protection solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) to record the distance between users and other phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordinated approach that includes a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single protocol. The decentralized agreement includes decentralized privacy proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, originally referred to as contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitivity protocol, and mobile contact tracking mechanism (PACT), etc.
Under these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device and all matches are made on the device.
The privacy team at MIT Media Lab has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy technology when collecting and using location or path cross data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the content development of the White Paper "Application Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in An Outbreak" released in March 2020. In addition, Enigma MPC, a company that also started at MIT Media Lab and is working on privacy technologies, is developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace leverages secure hardware technology to enable users to share sensitive locationand and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, a number of groups formed the Global TCN Alliance around basically the same approach and basically overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation of information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key to achieving a wide range of applications.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that its official government applications were using the open source BlueTrace protocol.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced a close contact tracking program that they say combines Bluetooth low-power technology with privacy encryption to protect privacy.
In addition, they published the core technical specifications used in the system.
Apple and Google say the system is planned in three phases:
Introduce tools to support governments in creating official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Integrating this capability directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to first roll out the system through an operating system update, and the system will be removed in the same way after the threat of an outbreak to address subsequent surveillance issues.
Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is the act of cleaning hands to remove dust, grease, microorganisms, or other useless substances from the hands.
Insisting on washing hands with soap at certain "critical times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted through the feces-mouth route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
Five key moments of the day when washing hands with soap are important: before and after defecation, before and after cleaning a child's hips or changing diapers, before feeding your child, before and after meals, and before and after eating or handling raw, fish, or poultry meat.
If there is no soap or water, your hands can be cleaned with grass ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands when:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Take care of the patient before and after.
After changing diapers or cleaning the hips of children who are in the toilet.
After wiping your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal food, or animal droppings.
Hand hygiene for medical personnel refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Wash your hands before dispensing or medical care to prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that may harm the body or cause disease on the hands.
Hand washing is especially important for people working in food processing or in the medical field, but it is also important for the public.
The health benefits of hand washing are many, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases;
and reduce infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices contributed slightly to increased height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory system and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by advocating simple behavioural changes (e.g., hand washing with soap).
This simple behavior can reduce the fatality rate of these diseases by nearly 50%.
The intervention to promote hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about one third, with the effect of providing clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap can reduce diarrhea events by 48%. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (Respiratory Infections, ARI) as a spontaneous act in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, and it kills about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
UNICEF says that washing hands with soap before and after meals can save lives, cutting deaths from diarrhoea by nearly half and causing acute respiratory infections by a quarter, than any single vaccine or medical intervention.
As part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, other hygiene interventions are often accompanied by advocacy for hand washing.
Hand washing can also prevent pustules that spread through direct physical contact.
Washing hands can have a slight adverse effect, i.e. frequent hand washing can cause dry skin, which can cause skin damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy skin, cracking, known as hand eczema or kermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Excessive frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
To reduce the spread of feces-mouth, be sure to wash your hands with soap during the day: after the toilet (draining, defecation), cleaning the child's hips (replacing diapers), before feeding your child, before meals, and before and after food is processed or after handling raw, fish or poultry meat.
To prevent the spread of disease, wash your hands in the correct way in the following cases: before or after handling incisions or wounds, after sneezing, coughing or snotling, touching animal droppings or treating animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7 percent of households use soap to wash their hands. According to a 2014 study, Saudi Arabia had the highest share at 97%, the United States was close to the average, at 77%, and China had the lowest, at 23%. Now, several ways to change behavior have been put in place to advocate for hand washing with soap at critical times. In order to enable children to develop hand-washing habits, developing countries may choose to allow school children to wash their hands collectively on a daily basis.
The Basic Health Care Plan, introduced by the Philippine Ministry of Education, is a model for large-scale initiatives to improve children's health and schooling.
At the heart of this national plan is insect repellent twice a year, complemented by daily hand washing with soap and brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste.
In Indonesia, the programme has also been successfully implemented.
The water is incorporated with soap or detergent to better remove microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce dissolution obstruction and improve solubility.
Water alone does not effectively clean the skin, as fat and protein (part of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.
However, clean hand washing requires reasonable water...
Solid soaps may retain bacteria left behind when used before, as they can be reused.
A small number of studies investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps and concluded that bacteria could not be transferred because they were washed away by foam.
But the CDC still claims that "it's best to use non-contact liquid soap."
Antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted in the health-conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in nature have been selected using recommended antimicrobials or disinfectants.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antimicrobial agents such as triclosan, which has a large number of resistant microbial strains.
So even if you don't choose antibacterial soaps for antibiotic-resistant strains, antimicrobial soaps may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to surfactants and skin care agents, complex formulations may also contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antibacterially active benzoic acid, and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) as pH-level regulators. A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that common soaps have the same effect as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from their hands.
Hot hands are comfortable, but they are not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria thrive quickly at body temperature (37 degrees C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that contain soil and bacteria.
Scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microorganisms on the hands, contrary to the prevailing view.
Water-free hand sanitizer or wash-free sterilizing hand sanitizer are non-water-based hand cleaners.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaners (also known as alcohol hand sanitizer, wash-free sterilizing hand lotion seiphone, or wash-free hand sanitizer) were popular.
Most of the formulations of these hand sanitizers contain isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, then add thickeners such as capom (acrylic polymer) to form gels, or add moisturizers such as glycerin to form a liquid, or foam yin to be easy to use and relieve dry skin caused by alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide can further increase antibacterial activity. A wash-free hand sanitizer containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol is effective for sterilization.
Alcohol-based hand liquor kills bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA-resistant and anti-vancomycin enterococci (VRE), tuberculosis, and viruses including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, bovine pox, influenza and hepatitis, and fungi.
After 30 seconds of alcohol-containing alcohol hand liquor, 99.97 percent of bacteria can be killed (3.5 orders of magnitude reduced, similar to a reduction of 35 dB), and 1 minute after handing down bacteria on the hand by 99.99 percent to 99.999 percent (4 to 5 orders of magnitude). Wash-free hand sanitizer is most effective for bacteria, while for some viruses it is slightly less effective.
Alcohol-based hand fluid has almost norovirus (also known as Novak, Norwalk) viruses (the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis) almost completely ineffective. You must use sufficient wash-free antiseptic hand sanitizer or alcohol hand sanitizer to thoroughly moisten or cover your hands.
Wash the palm and back of your hands, as well as between your fingers and the ends of all fingers, for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
The fingertips must also be fully washed and washed on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using wash-free hand fluids, especially if they look dirty.
These handlots are increasingly used because they are easy to use and quickly inactive to microorganisms;
Frequent use of alcohol-free hand sanitizer can cause dry skin unless the formula is formulated with emollients and/or moisturizers.
Glycerin and/or other moisturizers can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate dry skin caused by alcohol.
In clinical trials, alcohol-free hand sanitizer containing emollients can significantly reduce skin irritation and dry skin compared to soaps or antibacterial cleaners.
Allergic exposure to dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or allergies to additives in alcohol or alcohol-based handliquor are rare.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer is less likely to induce irritating contact dermatitis than washing hands with soap and water, which is one of the reasons for its attractiveness.
Waterless cleaners, while effective, do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
As a result, hand sanitizer-free is less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, as these pathogens are still in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends largely on ingredients and formulations, which have traditionally been much worse than alcohol and alcohol hand liquor.
Recently, the formulation using ammonium benzodiazepines has been proven to have sustained, cumulative antibacterial activity after use, which is different from alcohol, which has been shown to reduce the effect after reuse, possibly due to the gradual introduction of adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use grass ash or soil instead.
Grass ash or soil is better than washing hands with water alone, but not as well as soap.
One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may accelerate the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, grass ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes to water.
WHO recommends that if no soap is available, it can be replaced by grass ash or sand.
The correct hand washing steps recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:
Wet your hands with flowing warm or cold water.
It is recommended to use running water because vertical basins may be contaminated, and water temperature does not seem to matter much.
Wash repeatedly with enough soap to create foam, while cleaning the back of your hands, between your fingers, and your fingers.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies have shown that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of using water alone.
Wash for at least 20 seconds.
Washing creates friction, which helps remove bacteria from the skin, and the longer the wash takes, the more bacteria are removed.
Wash thoroughly with running water.
Washing hands with water basins can cause re-contamination.
Dry or naturally with a clean towel.
Wet hands are easier to recontamination. The thumb, wrist, area between fingers, and nail seams are the most commonly overlooked areas.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can hide microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are generally recommended to avoid dry hands, which can cause skin damage, increasing the risk of infection spreading.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available in developing countries, low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, for example, by pouring water from a hanging bucket or perforated gourd, and/or washing hands with grass and wood ash (if necessary). Water-saving hand-washing programmes, such as simple faucets and other low-cost methods, may be used where water supplies are limited (e.g., in schools or rural areas in developing countries).
The technique of a simple tap is simple, with a rope to hang a water tank, and then through a foot pedal to pour a small amount of water into the hand, and then use soap.
Effectively drying hands is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way to dry hands in public health rooms.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are more hygienic than electric dry phones provided in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Institute for The Tissue Symposium, comparing the hygiene of paper towels, warm-air dry phones and more modern jet-drying phones.
After washing hands, drying hands with a warm-air dry cell phone found an average increase of 194 percent in the total amount of bacteria on the finger and an average increase of 254 percent in the total amount of bacteria on the palm.
With jet dry cell hands, the total amount of bacteria on the finger increased by an average of 42%, and the total amount of bacteria on the palm increased by an average of 15%.
After washing hands, dry hands with paper towels, the total amount of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76%, the total amount of palm bacteria decreased by an average of 77%. The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether various dry-hands methods could cause cross-infection in other restrooms and toilet facilities.
The jet-drying phone is said to spray air at 180m/h (650km/h; 400mph) and can blow away microbes on the hands and body, potentially contaminating other toilet users and toilet facilities within 2 m.
Use a warm-air dry cell phone to spread microbes to a place of 0.25 meters outside the dry phone.
The results of dry hands using paper towels show that there is no serious microbial propagation. In 2005, a study was conducted in the T-V Produkt und Umwelt, which evaluated different ways of doing hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after drying:
The study involved many different dry cell phone manufacturers, who compared them to dry hands with paper towels.
During travel, you can choose to wash your hands with hand sanitized wipes without soap and water.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer should have a minimum alcohol content of at least 60%.
Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered in 1846 that hand washing was effective in preventing the spread of disease in hospitals, but it took a long time to force medical staff to wash their hands.
Hospitals use electronic devices that provide feedback to alert hospital staff if they forget to wash their hands.
One study found a decrease in infection rates after using these devices.
The medical staff wash hands for at least 15 seconds, using sufficient amounts of soap and water or gel to create foam and wash all parts of the wash.
The hands and fingers are clasping each other.
If there is residue between the seams of the nails, remove them with a hard brush.
Since the moisture left on the hands may still be bacterial, it must be thoroughly cleaned and dried with a clean towel.
After drying, turn off the tap with a paper towel (if necessary, open the exit door with a paper towel).
This prevents the hand from being contaminated again due to contact with these surfaces.
In health care facilities, the purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid transmission.
A report in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that in most medical settings, hand washing is still not acceptable, and that a large number of health care providers often forget to wash their hands before contacting patients, leading to microbial spread.
A study showed that proper hand washing, combined with other simple procedures, reduced the rate of catheter-related blood flow infection by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a worksheet that demonstrates standard hand washing and hand-washing methods in medical institutions.
The organization also publishes a draft hand hygiene guidelines on its website for public comment.
Whitby et al. conducted a related review.
If regulatory compliance needs to be verified, commercial equipment can be measured and validated by counterpart health.
The World Health Organization recommends "five moments" of hand washing:
After contact with blood/body fluids
Before sterile operation and
After taking care of the patient. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soaps ("soaps" or "antibacterial soaps") can make hand sanitizers have a bactericidal effect.
This sterilization operation may be required before surgery or in an environment with large numbers of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. When "scrubbing" your hands for surgery, there must be taps that can be turned on and off without contact, hand sanitizers containing chlorine or iodine, sterile towels used to dry hands after hand washing, sterile brushes for scrubbing and other sterile tools for cleaning nails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of the hand, forearm up to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
No long wash (10 minutes) is required.
When flushing, water from the forearm must be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing your hands, dry your hands with a sterile cloth and put on surgical clothes.
To reduce bacterial transmission, it is best to wash hands or use a wash-free sanitcide hand sanitizer before and after contact with the patient.
To control staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from the 20% frequency of hand washing, and when the frequency of cleaning hands increases to more than 35%, further benefits are extremely limited.
Washing hands with regular soaps more than triples the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to using antibacterial soap. Comparing the use of alcohol-based hand-bodied hands with hand washing with antibacterial soap (washed for 30 seconds each), the rate of bacterial infection using alcohol-based hand-bodied liquid was found to be 26% lower than that of antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handliquor spores for reducing the H1N1 influenza (HI1N1 influenza A) virus on the hand and the hard-to-identify Clostridium difficile spores. Interventions such as training employees on how to wash their hands, increase the availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and written and verbal reminders to employees can be used to improve hand hygiene in health facilities.
Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in a variety of medical settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an important cost-effective tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes widespread hand washing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even with cheap ways to build hand-washing stations, it is rare to have hand-washing taps near every private toilet or public restroom.
However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be a result of deep-rooted habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and promoting the use of soap to wash hands can influence policy development, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioural changes among the population.
To be effective, oversight and evaluation are required.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing hand washing rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that social marketing campaigns were less effective. An example of the school-promoting hand washing is the "Samsung Approach" introduced by UNICEF, which encourages schools, among other hygiene requirements, to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can rise from one star to the highest three stars.
Hand washing promotion activities could include the construction of hand-washing tables to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of hand washing awareness activities is World Handwashing Day, which aims to try to achieve behavioural change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of a hand-washing emoji.
Few studies have looked at the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing and the avoidance of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in developing countries.
However, reports have shown that it is more cost-effective to advocate for hand washing with soap than other water and sanitation interventions.
The first to recognize the importance of hand washing for human health, especially for those who are weak (e.g. mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals) were two pioneers in hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingle, the founder of modern nursing in Britain.
At that time, most people still thought the infection was caused by a stench known as radon.
The outbreak of foodborne diseases and medically induced infections in the 1980s prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to advocate hand hygiene more actively, emphasizing that hand hygiene is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters such as "Proper Handwashing" are hung next to hand-washing pools in public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets.
The idiom "wash your hands" means that someone declares that they do not want to be responsible for something or do not want to participate in something.
It derives from the biblical Gospel of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to nail Jesus, and later evolved into a widerange idiom among some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up imaginary stains, showing that she feels guilty about the crimes she committed and encouraging her husband to commit.
Studies have shown that people who think of or envision unethical behavior tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value hand-washing facilities more.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after contemcinst unethical behavior are less likely to engage in other "clean-up" compensation actions, such as volunteering.
Religion requires hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing of water, but without soap, is part of the iconic hand washing rituals of many religions, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, the bath-style (tevilah) and wash-in-the-net (netilat yadayim) cleansing rituals, the hand-washing rituals in Christianity and the small cleansing of Islam. Religion also has hygiene-related hand-washing regulations, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing after toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths and a major human disaster.
Similar to the homogenous virus SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although COVID-19 has a severity and mortality rate lower than SARS, it is more spreading, affecting more older people than young people and more men than women.
In view of the rapid increase in the number of publications related to new crown pneumonia, this paper wants to conduct a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly developing research topic.
We will introduce the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, is an unprecedented and memorable memory of the Chinese, with an outbreak of a new viral disease forcing everyone to stay at home throughout the holidays and the weeks that followed.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and theWorld Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, a related disease known as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country, before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 have died.
The WHO warned that COVID-19 had become the "public enemy number one" and that the threat could outweigh terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months since the virus sequence was first reported in multiple patients on January 7, 2020, covering virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment.
The purpose of this paper is to summarize the progress of research in this emerging subject area.
COVID-19 is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-induced disease, MERS (outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some pressing issues that remain to be resolved.
CoV has long been thought to be a non-lethal pathogen in humans, causing about 15% of the common cold4.
But this century has seen two outbreaks of highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and Saudi Arabia, and quickly spread to many other countries, with terrible morbidity and mortality.
As a result, this COVID-19 outbreak is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, 1, Wuhan first reported several cases of unexplained pneumonia to china's National Health AndI on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was announced.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of death was reported in Wuhan.
At the same time, the outbreak spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, a health care worker was reported to have contracted an infection, indicating a possible human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan closed its city and closed all public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study of xinguan pneumonia reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for infection from unknown animal origin.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency."
At the time of publication of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2 (Fig.2).
Due to the rapid development of the outbreak, the final scope and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided an updated description of the epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages, but the main age group is 30-65 years old.
Almost half (47.7%) The infected are over 50 years of age, a very small number are under the age of 20, and only 14 are under 10 years of age.
More men (0.31/100,000) are infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.27 per 100,000).
COVID-19 is mainly massed in Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 Takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people is growing exponentially by January 23, 2020, in line with the time of large-scale population movements before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (age 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large family of encapsulation viruses containing single-justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genus, alpha, beta, gamma, and argon, where alpha-CoV and beta-CoV are known to infect humans.
THE ENCAPSULATION GLYCOPROTEIN (S) OF SARS-COV AND MERS-COV BINDS TO ITS CELL RECEPTOR ANGIOTENSIN CONVERSION ENZYME 2 (ACE2) AND DIPEPTIDE PEPTIDEASE 4 (DPP4) AND THEN THE MEMBRANE FUSION OCCURS.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is replicated, the genome RNA forms a vesicle containing the virus together with the enveloplier protein and the nucleoshell protein, which then fuses with the plasmid and releases the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2, a new type of beta-CoV, had more than 99.98 percent gene consistency from 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, where the initial outbreak occurred.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to MERS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through a transmissant electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra-thin slices of the skin of the popular path.
Human ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the study found.
However, the s protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a weaker binding force to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients with less severe infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new type of short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFN beta;
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported on the full-length human ACE2 cryo-EM structure, which forms a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1, with a resolution of 2.9 ?.
They found that the complex had open and closed conformations, assembled into dipolymers, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins to provide evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Host
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by beavers and camels, respectively.
Compared to the system development of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus has 96% consistency with two SARS-like CoVs from bats, named bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, respectively.
However, it is not clear what intermediate host helps the virus infect humans across the species barrier, and the route of its transmission is yet to be clarified.
Ji et al. suggest that snakes are carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involve homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe that pangolins are considered to be a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, given that a CoV is found to be 99% genetically homogenous with SARS-CoV-2, a long-kissed anteater, which is often used in traditional Chinese medicine.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a huge difference;
The physical and chemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive 48 hours outside the body in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 degrees C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar nature.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to UV and heat - 56 degrees C for 30 minutes, and ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents are all known to be effective inactivated viruses, but chlorine is no longer effective inactivated.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so they are susceptible to this new virus.
There are currently no detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Fig.4).4).
In general, viruses are first identified by the host's inherent immune system through a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), including C-type coagulin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-sample receptors (RLR).
Viruses induce inflammatory factor expression through different pathways, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis, which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus get rid of the immune response.
The adaptive immune response will soon join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4 plus and CD8 plus T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4 plus T cells stimulate B cells to produce viral-specific antibodies, while CD8-T cells directly kill infected cells.
Auxiliary T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help these defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T-cell function by inducing apoptosis.
Body fluid immunity, including complements such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients can neutralise MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, over-reaction of the immune system produces large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections characterized by agglomeration are more likely to affect older people and pregnant women with multiple complications.
Typically, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impaired immune function are more likely to become infected than others.
According to a study of the oldest 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated at 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective isolation time to the most accurate incubation period, which prevents asymptomatic infected people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a rule, virus contacts or infected people usually need to be isolated for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19 and can be accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience breathing difficulties and/or hypoxemia one week after onset.
Severe cases can progress rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and clotting dysfunction.
Even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for viruses for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% breathing difficulty, 3% diarrhea, and 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies on family aggregation and asymptomatic individual transmission leading to clustering.
In contrast, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also developed fever (98%) and dry cough (47%) and breathing difficulties (55%) For the main symptom.
However, 80% of these patients require ventilation support, far more than those with COVID-19, and the fatality rate of MERS is higher than THAT of COVID-19.
Diarrhea was also observed in MERS patients (26%) and sore throat (21%).
In SARS patients, fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13 -25%) For the main symptom, about 14% to 20% of patients require ventilation support.
As of 14 February, there were 66,576 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with a mortality rate of 2%.
By comparison, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10% among 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An early study reported that SARS-CoV-2 had an R0 of 6.47, a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, and a R0 for SARS-CoV of 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 shows a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0.
The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher diffusion capability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Agglomeration usually occurs in the same family or comes from the same party or means of transport, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks prior to onset, or have a history of close contact with an infected person or patient.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, alerting them to prolonged isolation.
The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or decreased in the early stages of onset.
For example, leukocyte counts of 4 x 109/L - including lymphocyte count slt; 1 x 109/L - lymphocytic reduction, elevated levels of tinline amino metalyenzyme, and viral haemorrhage were found in 1,099 patients in COVID-19.
Some patients can see elevated levels of liver enzymes and myases and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients can see elevated blood C-reactive proteins and blood levels.
Higher levels of d-dipolymer, a product of blood fibrin degradation, and a decrease in lymphocyte count were visible in heavy-duty patients.
Most PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 CAN SEE CHEST IMAGING ANOMALIES, CHARACTERIZED BY TWO-SIDED PATCHED SHADOWS OR PULMONARY GRINDING GLASS SHADOWS.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Uncontrolled inflammation, fluid build-up and fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange when ARDS occurs.
Type I and Type II alveoli epithelial cell dysfunction reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst chest imaging findings usually coincide with the severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 found alveolar epithelial cell shedding, transparent membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte immersion, and polynucleic cytosis cells in the lungs of one patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathological manifestations of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcriptus polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criterion for diagnosing COVID-19.
However, because a high false negative rate may accelerate the outbreak, China began using clinical manifestations for diagnosis on February 13, 2020 (rather than relying solely on RT-PCR).
A similar condition occurred when SARS was diagnosed.
Therefore, combining medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and imaging results is essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Zhang Feng's team reported a solution that uses CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2 without a complex instrument, and a single test paper can detect synthetic copies of SARS-CoV fragments from 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 by 10-18 mol/L (10-100 viruses per microliter) in less than an hour.
If validated in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.
Due to a lack of experience in treating new Types of CoVs, doctors primarily provide support ive treatment for PATIENTs with COVID-19 while trying various treatments that have been used or proposed for other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma in recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It is even recommended that the plasma of recovered patients be used for the treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower rate, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the main threat and cause of death in patients.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including routine oxygen absorption, high-flow oxygen absorption, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive in vitro membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is well known that over-reaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients can lead to cytokine storms.
Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a range of cytokines, including TNf alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN alpha, IFN beta, IFN, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which are the leading causes of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe illness.
Corticosteroids and tozhuzumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine storms include: regulating The T-cell-oriented immune response; blocking IFN-sp, IL-1, and TNF; inhibiting JAK; bonathatose; cytokine signal transduction inhibitor syntrant synthasi 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to treat SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not conducive to severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially ischemic bone necrosis, which can seriously affect the prognosis.
Nevertheless, it is recommended to use low- and medium-dose corticosteroids with caution in patients with critical COVID-19.
At the time of writing, the existence of effective antiviral therapies has not been confirmed.
However, Redsewe, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Redsivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead and was originally used to treat diseases caused by the Ebola virus and Marburg virus.
Later, it was also shown that Redsewe may have suppressed other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gilead has supplied the drug to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with promising results.
In addition, barektini, alpha-interferon, lopinavir/litonevir and ribavirin have been recommended as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after the combination treatment of Lopinavir/Litonevir.
The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody production in recovered patients
Patients recovering from infectious diseases have a long history of collecting blood to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease.
In fact, recovered patients usually have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Igs) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, which can identify unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this principle, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of recovering COVID-19 patients and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and inflammation and viral load were found to decrease and oxygen saturation increased.
However, before specific therapies can be developed, it is necessary to validate and clarify methods that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered in view of the therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a toxic response that can be life-threatening.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low, while plasma is in high demand for critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, a more critical and practical approach is to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that encodes the effective antibodies, or to screen for the proteins necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily expand the scale of antibody production.
In China, TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases for thousands of years.
However, the effectiveness of treatment depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple ingredients in the prescription, which varies according to the TCM theory of disease diagnosis.
Most active ingredients are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their optimal combination.
Currently, Due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from severe illness.
For example, dewind detox capsules and conflowering-cleared plague capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87% of patients were treated with TCM, with the highest cure rates observed for COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7%) and Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province only used TCM treatment in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Chamberlain and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) alone treatment with WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptom loss, and hospitalization was significantly shorter than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from light to heavy) was significantly lower than in the WM group alone (7.4 percent vs. 46.2 percent), and the mortality rate in the WM-TCM group was also lower than in the WM group alone (8.8 percent vs. 39 percent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still requires higher quality control trials, a wider range, and more centers to confirm.
It will also be interesting to characterize the mechanisms of action of TCM therapy or its combinations and, where possible, clarify their active ingredients.
Most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 can experience great fear as a result of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those who are isolated will experience distress, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse reactions to treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
A range of psychological reactions were reported in the early stages of the SARS outbreak, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental motor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracing and isolation can increase anxiety and guilt about the impact of infection, isolation and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams to communicate clearly through regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and to avoid close contact using professional electronic devices and applications.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from animal hosts and infected patients to susceptible hosts, and are often used as a complementary tool for antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has worked to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
The live vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.
However, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in older adults and in lethal sexual assault models and their protective effect on zoonotic viral infections have not been determined until clinical studies have been initiated.
This is most likely due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and cluster morbidity of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic diseases in affected areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles, and recombinant protein subakis, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for non-immune individuals against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and critical task to control the current outbreak.
However, this difficulty can be challenging due to the long time it takes to develop vaccines (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic changes in CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to demonstrate its complete clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, patients with COVID-19 severe illness also have high morbidity and mortality rates.
Therefore, the development of prognostic models for the disease is critical to prioritizing services in health-care institutions, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to the clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or correlate the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor influencing the SARS prognosis, as is COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred primarily in the 30-65 age group, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age.
Patients in intensive care are more likely to have underlying complications and complications, and are significantly older than those who do not require intensive care (median age 66 to 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor in the outcome of PATIENTs with COVID-19.
Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000) are infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Complications and Complications: PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 WHO REQUIRE INTENSIVE CARE ARE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ACUTE HEART INJURY AND ARRHYTHMIA.
Heart events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also be combined with ACE2-positive bile duct cells, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may interact with each other.
Laboratory test results are abnormal: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been considered a potential prognosticfactor for disease, therapeutic response, and eventual recovery.
It has also been suggested that CRP levels are correlated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
In addition, elevated lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), tthanine amino metase (AST), alanine amino metase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Time progression of chest imaging examinations and clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immunosuppressants and are commonly used as complementary treatments for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from ischemic bone necrosis, resulting in lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used in small doses and for short periods in PATIENTs with COVID-19 if needed.
Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients are under great stress because they often suffer from prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty, and have witnessed the death of relatives and sick friends.
Counselling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get out of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to differ from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and can cause mild symptoms or asymptomatic in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
As a result, infected persons in the early stages of onset or incubation period will produce a large number of viruses in the course of daily activities, to the control of the outbreak has a great difficulty.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV is thought to occur when the patient is in serious condition, and most of the transmission does not occur in the early stages.
As a result, the current OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 is more severe and difficult to control compared to SARS.
China is making significant efforts, including blocking Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuing to isolate almost all its population, with a view to halting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have already caused serious damage to China's economy and others, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the pace of outbreaks is slowing.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.
Other experts, however, are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. have modelled the consequences of an outbreak, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Team in Canada reported that sars-CoV-2 was detected in both the nasal asethes and pharynx swabs of patients who recovered and discharged two weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a flu-like cycle.
But with the number of new cases falling, there are encouraging signs in China that the current strategy may have worked.
The Ebola virus was predicted to cause 1 million cases and kill half a million people.
However, through strict isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less contagious, eventually disappearing or becoming less pathogenic viruses coexisting with the human body.
A comparison of THE COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS (Figure Fig.55) is provided below.
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and possibly even through direct contact with items contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, increasing the likelihood of fecal mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases, 41% of which may have been caused by in-hospital infections, including 17 patients with previous other conditions and 40 health care workers.
Therefore, more stringent precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have had contact with the patient or infected person.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a mask, and the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent droplets from potentially infected people from spreading through the air or sticking to the surface of items that may be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks prevent inhalation of virus bodies as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viral bodies are fully penetrating;
Because viral particles can even penetrate five stacked surgical masks, healthcare workers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care workers should wear isolation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask;
Therefore, health care workers should also wear a transparent mask or goggles when facing patients.
For members of the public in areas affected by or potentially affected by the outbreak, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands more frequently than usual with sterilizing soap, stay indoors as far as possible to isolate themselves, and limit contact with potential lying people.
Three feet is considered to be the appropriate distance for people to keep away from the patient.
These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, the high homologous nature reported on January 7, 2020 and SARS-CoV should have caused china to be highly alert, based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention was still reassuring the public, saying that the new virus was not contagious, that human-to-human transmission was limited, and that the outbreak was preventable and controllable.
The news clearly relaxed the public's vigilance, and the Spring Festival is coming, the outbreak in Wuhan to contain the key nodes were thus missed.
China's disease control agencies are likely to learn this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in making announcements because each word is vital to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals than waiting for a formal report by a doctor or official; (3) more stringent control of potential outbreaks at an early stage than an attempt to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months it has spread to all of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak looks like a SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are critical to controlling outbreaks and treating patients.
More older people than young people, more men than women, and older patients are more severe and mortality than younger patients.
The mortality rate for SARS is higher than THAT of COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Even if there are no symptoms, PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 can still transmit the virus, while SARS patients usually do not transmit the virus until the condition is severe, making it much more difficult to control THE spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some PATIENTS WITH COVID-19, routine RNA test results for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, cured patients may turn de-yang again.
These findings greatly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Given the rapid research on COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be resolved:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic homologousness was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats, SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal transmits the virus from its original host, assuming a bat, to the human intermediate host?
Without the answer to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off the route of transmission, and outbreaks can recur at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells in other organs that express ACE2?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this outbreak last?
How does a virus inherit from a human being?
Will it become a global pandemic? Disappear like SARS? Or do you relapse as usual as the flu?
Finding answers to these and many other questions is critical, but it may take a long time.
However costly, however costly, we have no choice but to stop the outbreak and bring our lives back to normal as soon as possible.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been clinically completed, multiple attempts to develop the vaccine are still under way.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against the disease-causing virus, SARS-CoV-2, for 18 months.
In April, five candidate vaccines entered Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 WAS DISCOVERED IN DECEMBER 2019.
In 2020, a large-scale outbreak spread globally, triggering a massive investment and research campaign to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using the published viral genome to develop a possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
CEPI presented a vaccine development plan in April and said the priority was speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global accessibility.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were developing and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.
Key platform targets for Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Candidate Vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vectors (Phase I Developer and Candidate Vaccine: CanSino Biologics, Type 5 Adenovirus Vectors)
CEPI scientists reported in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines are in early development, of which 78 have been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 have been announced, but little information has been made public (presumably planning or design).
The Phase I-II trial siphoned at preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled multi-point trials, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccine prevention of disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at optimal doses.
Of the 79 actively developed vaccine candidates (confirmed until early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated (still in "preclinical" studies).
On or about January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

They hope to develop a vaccine candidate and conduct human trials "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development program.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materials Command at Fort Dett., and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both located in western Maryland, announced that they are working on a vaccine.
On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announces partnership with Novavax Inc.
Development and production of vaccines.
The two agencies further announced plans for preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that it was working on 11 isolated strains that, even if accelerated, would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that virus-like particles of the coronavirus had been developed with some funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health.
The candidate vaccine is under going into laboratory research and is scheduled to enter human trials in July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a 'large sum of money' to obtain exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine," a protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, Pfizer, a Us pharmaceutical company, announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based candidate vaccine BNT162 is currently in preclinical preclinical phase and is expected to begin clinical trials in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive preclinical test results in April 2020, with the final candidate vaccine likely to begin human trials in the fall.
On March 19, 2020, in France, the Alliance for Epidemiological Prevention Innovation (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in the establishment of a COVID-19 Vaccine Research Alliance comprising the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to $29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners in COVID-19 vaccine development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal trials on six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplified RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the virus sequence published in China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced $275 million to fund 96 medical countermeasures research projects for COVID-19, including a number of candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as The Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan program.
Around the same time, the Government of Canada announced a $192 million dedicated investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and plans to establish a national "vaccine pool", including several new ones, so that these vaccines could be put into use in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a test of PittCoVac, a COVID-19 vaccine that may be used in mice, and said that "the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine provided by MNA enables a strong antigen-specific response in mice that begins to appear within 2 weeks of immunity."
On April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo, Canada, announced the design of a DNA-based candidate vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
Using phages, the researchers designed DNA to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless viral-like particles, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources and combined cloud computing resources from HP, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to access IBM's supercomputers.
Some vaccines have heterogenous effects, also known as nonspecific effects.
This means that they have other benefits than disease prevention.
Further randomized trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or ineffective.
Early studies using COVID-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals, and non-human primates, to assess the efficacy of vaccines have shown the need for biosafety level 3 containment measures for the treatment of live viruses and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no safe and effective SARS treatment or preventive vaccine for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for SARS treatment is a top priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, there is currently no effective vaccine for MERS.
At the time of the MERS epidemic, it was thought that existing SARS studies could provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and therapies for MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I human clinical trials and three others are in development, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two are adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one is MVA-MERS-S.
Various social media posts fuel conspiracy theories that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that vaccines are already available.
Patents cited in various social media articles refer to existing patents for other coronaviruses, such as SARS coronavirus, strains of the virus and vaccines.
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2, ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of the cell in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 is expected to be a drug target for cardiovascular disease by reducing the content of angiotensin II and increasing the content of Ang (1-7) to inhibit the activity of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (Angiotensin-converting Enzyme, ACE). ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronaviruses into cells.
The human-derived version of this enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
THE ACE2 PROTEIN CONTAINS AN N-END PEPTIDEASE M2 DOMAIN AND A C-END COLLECTRIN KIDNEY AMINO ACID TRANSPORTER PROTEIN DOMAIN.
ACE2 is a single-pass Type I membrane protein whose enzyme-active domain is exposed to the cell surface of the lungs and other tissues.
Another enzyme, called sheddase, splits the extracellular domain of ACE2 from the transmembrane domain, producing soluble proteins that are released into the blood stream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 adheres to the cell membrane, mainly lung type II alveoli cells, intestinal epithelial cells of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells in most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to counterbalance ACE.
ACE splits angiotensin I into angiotensin II with angioconyactive activity.
ACE2 then lyses the amino acid phenylalanine at the end of the carnage of Asp-Arg-Val-Val-Tyr-Ile-He-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysated it to angiotensin (1-7), which has angioding activity, (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Ile-His-He-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also lysing many other peptides, including deargline 9 peptides, epalin, neuropressurein, strong phorphorin A, and gastric hunger.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronaviruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 stingproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bind to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface, causing the lining to transfer the virus and enzymes together into the nucleus of the cell.
This entry process also requires the activation of the S protein caused by host serine protease TMPRSS2, and the suppression of the process is currently being studied as a potential treatment. Some have speculated that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators recommend the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group."
"For patients with a higher risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure, the use of ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia."
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but the results are not as reliable as reducing the overall risk of pneumonia. "
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new method for treating acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamic strains and oxygen saturation in pigs with hyperlipolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in the human body is approximately 10 hours, the effect time is 30 minutes, and the duration (duration) of the action is 24 hours.
Some studies have shown that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance of classic renin-angiotensin system (RENin-angiotensin system, RAS) inhibitors or diseases with elevated levels of circulating angiotensin II. The efficacy of rhACE2 infusion on acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated by clinical trials.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak is a continuing spread of 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was listed as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and was declared an epidemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases and approximately 97,000 deaths have been reported in 210 countries and territories worldwide.
About 364,000 people were cured.
China has a fatality rate of about 4%, while the global mortality rate is between 0.08% (New Zealand) and 13.04% (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
It may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The incubation period from contact to onset ranges from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.
There is currently no vaccine or special antiviral treatment.
Clinical treatment is mainly supportive treatment. Recommended precautions include frequent hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a safe distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspected infected people.
Official agencies in various countries have responded to travel restrictions, segregation, curfews, workplace hazard prevention and control, and facility closures.
The outbreak has hit the world's economy and society hard, with sports, religious, political and cultural events postponed or cancelled, and panic shopping exacerbated by widespread supply shortages.
About 99.4% of primary and secondary school and college students are affected by national or local suspensions in 193 countries and territories around the world.
As a result of the spread of false viral information on the Internet, there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other groups of people of origin and appearance in other East and South-East Asia, and groups in areas with high outbreaks.
However, reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry have led to a drop in the air pollution index and a reduction in carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, the health department in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, notified a number of cases of unexplained pneumonia and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the South China seafood wholesale market, so the new coronavirus is considered a zoonotic disease.
The virus that triggered the outbreak, called SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely associated with bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first patients were confirmed to have developed on 1 December 2019 and were not clearly associated with a subsequent batch of South China seafood market cases.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China seafood market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report that the first case, probably dated November 17, 2019, was a 55-year-old male from Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported a decline in new reported cases in China, but italy, Iran and South Korea saw a sudden surge in new cases, surpassing the number of new cases outside China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially mild cases.
As of 26 February, relatively few juvenile cases had been reported, with only 2.4% of juvenile cases worldwide aged 19 and under. Patrick Valance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimates that about 60% of the UK's population needs to be infected with the new coronavirus to be effectively immunized in the community.
The number of cases is the number of people who have received THE COVID-19 test and have confirmed positive test results according to the official scheme.
As of March 23, no more than 3% of the world's population had been tested, and many countries had issued official policies for people without detection of mild illness, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
As of January 23, an estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 people in China were undetected, and these undocumented infections were the source of 79 percent of recorded cases, according to a study published on March 16.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30th, the actual number of infections in Italy far exceeds the number of reported cases.
The basic number of infections (R0) of COVID-19 was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that R0 may be 5.7.
Most PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 RECOVER.
Patients who cannot recover from onset to death are 6-41 days, most common 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 people died from COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80 percent of deaths in China were among people over 60 years of age, and 75 percent of deaths were accompanied by underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics on COVID-19 deaths usually refer to deaths that test positive for the new coronavirus under official protocols.
The actual COVID-19 death son-in-one may be far higher than the statistics, as the data may not include patients who have not been tested, such as those who have died at home, nursing home, etc.
Some data from Italy show that the actual death toll during the outbreak was 4-5 times that of the official number of new cases of pneumonia.
A CDC spokeswoman said: "We know that the number of deaths published is below the actual figure", and rumors that the U.S. data are undervalued confirm the claim. Underestimation is common in epidemiological areas, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. On January 9, 2020, Wuhan saw the first confirmed death in China.
On 1 February, the first death outside China occurred in the Philippines and on 14 February, the first death outside Asia occurred in France.
As of February 28, there were more than a dozen deaths in Iran, South Korea and Italy outside China.
As of March 13, deaths had been reported in more than 40 countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica. There are several methods commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and vary over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the timing of the outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status. The fatality rate is the result of the death rate divided by the number of confirmed people over a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global fatality rate as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The fatality rate varies from region to region.
In China, the fatality estimate decreased from 17.3% (patients with the onset of the disease from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (patients who became ill after February 1, 2020). Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflect the percentage of deaths from disease as a percentage of confirmed cases, and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of disease deaths (including confirmed and undiagnosed) infections.
These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process of specific populations from infection to case resolution.
Many scholars try to calculate these data for specific groups of people.
The University of Oxford's Evidence-Based Medical Center estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the outbreak ranges from 0.1% to 0.39%.
The upper limit of the estimate for this range is in line with the first random test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis study to detect the effect shaded on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization says the outbreak is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and vary by region.
"If left unchecked, outbreaks of infectious diseases usually go into stagnation after the existing host runs out and then begin to ease," says Maciej Boni of Penn State University.
But at the moment it is almost impossible to reasonably predict when the inflection point will occur. "
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, said that if all countries mobilized to adopt the World Health Organization's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus, "an end to the outbreak in June can be expected".
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said SARS-CoV-2 "could flare up repeatedly for a year or two." "
A study led by Neil Ferguson at Imperial College found that "it may take 18 months or more before the vaccine is put into service" and that it is important to maintain physical distance and other measures.
"This coronavirus is so highly spread that I don't think it's going to go away altogether," says William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, "which could turn into a seasonal disease that erupts once a year." "
The pathogenicity of a re-e-outbreak depends on the degree of population immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively nonspecific and some infected people may be asymptomatic.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (sputum), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea, or sepsis. According to the World Health Organization, about one in six patients become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bruising of the face or lips as emergency symptoms; Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic and have no clinical manifestations, but test positive, so the researchers recommend close observation and examination of close contacts in confirmed patients to rule out the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the rate of asymptomatic infections varies from very low to 44%.
The incubation period (from infection to onset) is generally 1-14 days; With regard to uncertainty, one example can be illustrated: the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially estimated at 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details about the route of transmission of the disease have not yet been determined.
It is currently believed that the disease is mainly transmitted through close contact and droplets produced when coughing, sneezing or speaking;
The study found that an unobstructed cough can cause droplets to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (15-27 feet).
It has also been suggested that droplets produced by people talking can also cause the spread of the virus if they stay in the air for longer periods of time. Although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air, it can also produce droplets when people exhale or speak.
The droplets can fall on the mouth and nose of people around them and even be inhaled into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR can atomize respiratory secretions, which in turn can cause airborne transmission.
In addition, if a person touches a surface contaminated with the virus, including the skin, and then touches his or her eye and nose, it may also cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 feces spreading. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after onset, but is also contagious before and after onset.
Positive results can be detected as early as three days before onset, indicating that the new coronavirus is contagious before the apparent symptoms occur.
Although laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases are rarely reported, asymptomatic infections have been detected in some countries in the course of contact tracing investigations.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that while the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet clear, it is common for 1 person to infect 2-3 people. The virus survives on the surface of an object for a range of hours to days.
Specifically, the new coronavirus is known to survive up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature. THERE HAVE BEEN CASES OF COVID-19 TESTING POSITIVE FOR PETS AND OTHER ANIMALS.
There is no evidence that animals transmit the virus to humans again, but UK authorities advise people to wash their hands after contact with animals, just as they do with other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients in a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presentin in the associated coronaviruses of nature. Before the virus enters the body, it can be killed with household soap, which dissolves the virus's protective sac membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
It is currently considered a zoonotic disease.
Genetic analysis showed that the coronavirus was genetically associated with the beta coronavirus genus Sarbecovirus (Cluster B) and two clusters of bat-derived viruses.
The new coronavirus and other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) have 96% consistency at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that viruses in pangolins were only one amino acid worse than viruses in humans in certain parts of the genome sequence.
To date, genome-wide comparisons have found that up to 92% of the genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is the same, not enough to prove that pangolin is the intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be initially diagnosed based on symptoms, but is ultimately only confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretion.
A PCR-CT comparison study in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many imaging features coincided with other pneumonia and disease developmentprocesses.
As of March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommends that "CT should not be used for screening for COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease." "
The World Health Organization has now announced several nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
Nucleic acid detection uses real-time reverse transcriptus polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory or blood samples can be used for testing.
Results can usually be obtained in a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed by a nasopharyngeal swab and also by a pharynx swab. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have been proven to be accurate enough to approve widespread use.
In the United States, serological trials developed by Cellex have been approved for use only in emergency situations by certified laboratories.
Typical imaging characteristics of X-ray and computertomized tomography (CT) in patients with the disease include peripheral grinding glass shadow asymmetry and chest-free fluid.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database on the image performance of confirmed cases.
Because of the combination of other viral infections, such as adenoviruses, images that have not been confirmed by PCR are limited in specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China comparing chest CT results with PCR results found that although images are less specific to identify infections, they are faster and more sensitive to detect, so they could be considered as a screening tool for endemic areas.
An artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural network has been developed to jointly use X-pieces and CT to detect the image characteristics of viruses.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include good personal hygiene practices, frequent hand washing, avoiding unwashed hands and touching the nose and nose directly, covering your mouth and nose with paper towels when coughing or sneezing, and throwing used paper towels directly into the trash can.
Suspected infected persons should wear a medical surgical mask when entering public places.
Measures to maintain physical distance are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have restricted or advised to avoid non-essential travel to and from affected countries and regions.
However, the virus is now in the community-wide spread ingephase in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, and some community residents have no way of knowing where or how they were infected. Health care workers who come into contact with suspected infected persons should take standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important means for health regulators to identify the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
More than 100 groups, including Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for restrictions on such surveillance, as the government uses mobile phone location data for tracking purposes, raising privacy concerns.
A variety of mobile apps are currently in use or in place for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-protected solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other phones.
Users receive information alerts as soon as they have been in close contact with patients who have tested positive for COVID-19. False statements about preventing infection continue to spread;
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.
It is recommended to wash hands frequently to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when there is significant dirt on their hands, before mealtimes, and after snot, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because the virus can destroy its protective sac membranes by simply using household soap before entering the body, thus killing the virus.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends using alcohol-containing hand sanitizer scouring at least 60% if you don't have soap or tap water around you.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
The surface of the object can be disinfected with a variety of solutions (the disinfectant works within one minute of the action on the stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyvitamin iodized.
Other solutions, such as ammonium benzodiazepines and chlorohexulate, are less effective.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all areas, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and patient-used ATMs, be disinfected if new suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia occur at facilities such as offices or day care facilities.
WHO recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with bent elbows or paper towels when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of all contaminated paper towels immediately.
Medical surgical masks are recommended for suspected infected persons, as wearing masks can reduce the amount of droplets and reduce transmission distance when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on the use and use of masks.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: "Wearing a mask reduces people's tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection when hand hygiene is not in place." In addition, it is recommended that persons responsible for the care of suspected infected persons wear masks.
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for COVID-19 patients, although the organization also recognizes that wearing a mask helps avoid face-touching.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing a non-medical mask made of cloth. China explicitly recommends that healthy citizens also wear disposable medical masks, especially when they are in close contact with others (within 1 meter (3 feet).
Masks are recommended when using public transport or entering crowded areas in Hong Kong, China.
Thai health officials advise people to make their own masks and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly prohibited from entering public places without wearing masks or blocking their noses and noses.
On March 16, Vietnam required everyone to wear a mask to enter public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires all people to wear masks when entering grocery stores.
Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, began requiring the use of masks on trains and intercity buses from April 1.
Panama requires residents who are not able to wear masks to wear masks for going out, and recommends that residents who cannot buy them make their own masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infection prevention and control measures to maintain social distance (also known as physical distance) are designed to minimize close contact between people and thus slow the spread of the disease.
Measures include segregation, travel restrictions, school stops, suspensions, and closures of stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
In terms of maintaining a social distance, individuals can take steps such as staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, switching to contactless greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments now require or advise areas affected by the outbreak to maintain social distance.
With regard to the largest population cluster, the initial recommendation of the United States Government agency and WHO was 250 people (in areas where COVID-19 was not transmitted), which was quickly reduced to 50 and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, public gatherings of more than two people were banned in Germany. Older people and groups with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and compromised immune systems are at higher risk of severe illness and complications. The German CDC advises such people in affected areas to stay away from the situation as much as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began replacing the term "keeping a physical distance" with the term "keeping a social distance" to clarify that the aim was to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, including virtual and long-distance contacts.
The use of the phrase "staying at a social distance" implies that people are completely socially isolated and does not encourage other ways to keep people connected. A number of authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines that apply during pandemics.
Among the recommendations are sex with a partner who lives with out of the virus or has no symptoms.
COVID-19 Self-isolation is recommended in the home of confirmed and suspected infected patients.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many governments have forced or recommended self-isolation by all residents of affected areas.
The most severe self-isolation instructions were also issued for high-risk groups.
Patients who may have been exposed to COVID-19, or who have recently been to a country or region where widespread transmission have recently been, are advised to self-isolation for 14 days from the time they may be finally exposed to the virus.
Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment/suppression and mitigation.
Containment applies to the early stages of an outbreak with the aim of tracking and isolating infected persons, while adopting other infection prevention and control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to other populations.
If it is no longer possible to contain the spread of disease, efforts should be made to transition to the mitigation phase: measures to slow the spread of disease and reduce the impact of disease on health systems and societies.
Containment and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.
Inhibition requires more extreme prevention and control measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic regenerations to less than 1. Part of the effort to control outbreaks is to try to reduce the peak of the outbreak, which we know is the flattening of the epidemiological curve.
This reduces the risk of health service collapse and buys more time for vaccines and treatment options.
Non-drug interventions to contain the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-isolation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension of school and cancellation of mass gatherings; community action aimed at encouraging acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning. In the face of a significantly worsening outbreak, China immediately adopted more stringent outbreak containment measures, such as sealing cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and local isolation measures and issued alerts on the trajectory of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for self-isolated people and imposes huge fines on those who refuse to self-segregate.
Taiwan, China, has increased the production of masks and imposed penalties on suppliers of medical supplies that are sold at the expense of the goods. Simulations of the United Kingdom and the United States show that both mitigation (slowing but not preventing the spread of the epidemic) and containing (reversing the spread of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
The best mitigation policy could cut peak medical needs by two-thirds, cut the number of deaths in half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Inhibition may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus stops spreading in the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever comes first), otherwise the spread will rebound quickly once the measure is relaxed.
Long-term interventions aimed at curbing pandemics have social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs have not yet been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is ongoing, including trials of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, rehydration fluids, and rest ingenuation may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may cause the situation to worsen.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied to determine whether they are suitable for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also notes that some "traditional and family therapies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization says improved processing capacity and adjusting medical systems to meet the needs of PATIENTs with COVID-19 are the basic outbreak response.
ECDC and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospital and primary health care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, removing as many selective procedures as possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care capacity through training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
Speculation about the origin of the first case, the so-called patient number zero, is widely debated.
The first known case of new coronavirus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of new coronavirus escants in Hubei Province increased gradually.
Most of these patients are associated with the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, a theory that the new coronavirus originates from one of these animals, or, in other words, from zoonotic disease. On December 26, Zhang Jixian, a doctor at the Chinese and Western Medicine Union Hospital in Hubei Province, first found and treated a group of unexplained pneumonia patients and reported them to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Jianghan District, Wuhan, on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were disciplined by the police for spreading "rumours", while another doctor, Effin, was admonished by his superiors for sounding the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health And Wellness Board subsequently issued an announcement on December 31st and reported it to the World Health Organization.
Wuhan's health department launched an investigation in early January after receiving numerous reports of cases of unexplained pneumonia. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases roughly doubled every seven and a half days.
From early January to mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China due to the large population movement of the Chinese New Year and Wuhan as a transportation hub and major railway hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including 2 in Beijing and 1 in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official figures show that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States had surpassed China and Italy in the number one confirmed case in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 cures.
Confirmed cases have been reported in approximately 200 countries and territories around the world.
As a result of the European epidemic, many countries in the Schengen area have adopted preventive measures to restrict the free movement of people and establish border controls.
National responses include containment, such as segregation (also known as home orders, in-place asylum orders or blockades) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90 percent of the total population, were under some form of blockade, more than 50 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26th 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of blockade, and two days later that number rose to 2.6 billion, or about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan;
Dr. Zhang Jixian discovered a number of unexplained cases of pneumonia on December 26 and reported the situation to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Jianghan District, Wuhan, on December 27.
On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronaviruses was found during preliminary genetic testing of patient samples.
Wuhan Health Board issued an announcement on December 31st,
Reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.
After these notices were issued, several doctors in Wuhan City were disciplined by the police for "rumours" of the outbreak of walking.
China's National Health And Seihad initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, which Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) central committee, later called a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
On January 23rd the government announced the lifting of an epidemic prevention line in Wuhan to ban people from entering and leaving the city, which later extended to 15 other cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people, making it the largest quarantine incident in human history.
Private cars are prohibited in the city.
Many places have also cancelled the Celebration of the Chinese New Year (January 25).
The government also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Mount Fire Hospital, which will be completed and delivered within 10 days.
Another hospital, Raytheon Hill Hospital, was subsequently built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospital, China has transformed 14 other venues in Wuhan, such as the convention center and the stadium, into a square-class hospital. On January 26, the government took further steps to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations to travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Colleges and primary and secondary schools across the country have also been closed.
A number of measures have also been taken in Hong Kong and Macau, particularly for primary and secondary schools and universities.
China has implemented measures to work from home on a large number of locations.
In addition to Hubei Province, travel restrictions have also been imposed on other identities.
Public transport has been adjusted and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Many cities have public facilities under control, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) are subject to some form of outdoor activity restrictions. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "entering" from other countries and regions.
For example, Beijing imposes a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all foreign visitors to Beijing. In the five days to 23 March, there were only one local case in Chinese mainland, transmitted by a traveller returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases in the country had been largely contained and that the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, hubei areas other than Wuhan began to liberalize travel restrictions after a full two months of imposing the blockade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced on March 26, 2020 that it would suspend the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits from March 28, without disclosing details as to when the policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China are required to apply for a visa from the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to return to work on March 30, and offered a monetary stimulus package. The State Department declared April 4 as a national day of mourning and began a three-minute national observitment at 10:00 a.m. The day coincides with the Qingming Festival, when the central government encourages families to mourn their loved ones online to maintain physical distance and avoid a secondary outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak.
On 20 January 2020, a confirmed case of COVID-19 occurred in Korea.
South Korea's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to a new religious movement rally in Daegu, South Korea, the New World Jesus Church.
The Shinto believers who traveled from Wuhan to Daegu are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 of the 9,336 church members, or about 13 percent, reported symptoms. South Korea declared a high alert level on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in South Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
Three soldiers tested positive for the virus, and all South Korean military bases have since been quarantined.
Flight schedules have also been adjusted for the impact of the outbreak. South Korea has launched what is considered the world's largest and best-organized virus prevention and control program, which screens large populations for viruses, isolates all infected people, and tracks and isolates close contacts of infected people.
Screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms from new arrivals from abroad via mobile apps, a virus-free test, results the next day, and improved testing capacity, which can accommodate up to 20,000 people per day.
Although the entire city has not been quarantined, South Korea's plan is seen as a success for outbreak prevention and control. South Korean society initially showed a polarizing attitude to President Moon E-Ahn's response to the crisis.
Many South Koreans signed the petition, with calls for impeachment, accusing the government of mishandling the outbreak and praising his response.
On March 23, South Korea reported the lowest single-day total of new cases in four weeks.
March 29 reported that from April 1st, all new arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries and regions, media reported on April 1.
On 19 February, Iran announced the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Qom, and two patients later died that day, according to the Iranian Ministry of Health.
Early measures announced by the government include the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the total closure of universities, higher education institutions and primary and secondary schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said there were no plans to seal off areas affected by the outbreak, but only to isolate infected individuals.
In March, Iran announced plans to restrict intercity travel, but intercity traffic congestion continued into the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrine in the Qom area remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. In February, Iran became the center of transmission after China.
Many believe the extent of the outbreak in Iran has been overshadowed, including that as of 28 February, the tracing of cases in more than a dozen countries was directed at Iran, indicating that the actual outbreak in Iran was more serious than the 388 cases reported by the government as of that date.
Iran's parliament was forced to close, and 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prisons to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful expression of dissent and to release all eligible prisoners on an interim basis.
The organization notes that the risk of transmission of the virus in closed institutions such as detention centres is greater and that these institutions lack adequate health care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number of single-day deaths reported in the country since the outbreak began.
As of 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 new confirmed cases per hour, and one new case of coronavirus death every 10 minutes.
According to World Health Organization officials, the actual number of cases in Iran is likely to be five times higher than reported.
There is also the view that U.S. sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial resources in dealing with the outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions in the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome, and the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy.
The country's number of cases has since risen sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A number of unrelated COVID-19 cases were subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On February 22nd a cabinet meeting announced new decrees to curb the spread of the epidemic, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people in 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared: "No access to affected areas is strictly prohibited.
The affected areas have ordered suspensions and suspensions of sporting events". On March 4th the Italian government ordered schools at all levels across the country to close at all levels, as the number of domestic deaths reached 100.
All major sporting events, including the Italian Football League, will be held until April in an audience-free mode, but on 9 March all sporting events will be completely suspended for at least a month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all business activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian Society of Anaesthetic Analgesic Severity Medicine (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on possible triage options.
On March 19, Italy reported 3,405 deaths from the pandemic, surpassing China as the world's largest number of new coronavirus deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, italy had a cumulative total of 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cures, most of which occurred in lombardy.
CNN has reported that italy's large elderly population and the number of people who have so far failed to detect all viral infections may be partly the cause of the high mortality rate.
The UK's initial response to the virus is thought to be one of the most relaxed countries in the affected countries. It was not until 18 March 2020 that the British Government began to implement various forms of social distance-keeping or mass segregation of its citizens.
The British government has been criticised for its lack of speed and effort in dealing with public concerns. On March 16, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending the removal of any non-essential travel and social contact, advising people to work from home whenever possible and avoiding places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On March 20th the government announced that all leisure premises, including bars and gyms, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to cover up to 80 per cent of workers' wages and a monthly maximum of 2,500 pounds to prevent unemployment in crisis situations. On March 23rd the Prime Minister announced tougher measures to keep the community at a distance, banning gatherings of more than two people and not taking any travel or outdoor activities unless absolutely necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the announced restrictions are enforced by the police by way of fines and dispersal of rallies.
With the exception of operations such as supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages that were deemed "essential", most of the other businesses were ordered to shut down.

On January 28, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the u.S. government's main public health agency, announced that it had developed its own testing kits.
Still, the U.S. has a slow start in testing, masking the reality of the outbreak at the time.
The federal government's February kit was defective, and the federal government did not approve the use of non-government kits (from academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and it was not until early March that the test eligibility limits were determined (and then required medical advice), all of which prevented pre-testing in the United States.
On February 27, The Washington Post reported that the total number of tests performed in the United States was less than 4,000.
On March 13, The Atlantic reported that the total number of tests carried out in the United States was less than 14,000.

The World Health Organization noted the contrast between the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004 and the current crisis. In the SARS outbreak, chinese authorities have been accused of concealing the truth and obstructing prevention and containment efforts, and in this crisis, the central government "has begun to update the situation regularly before the Lunar New Year holiday to avoid panic".
On January 23rd, in response to the central government's decision to impose a city closure on Wuhan, Who representative Gao Li said that while this was "certainly not a recommendation of the World Health Organization", it "fully reflects the determination to contain the spread of the epidemic from the areas where the epidemic is concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency (PHEIC) of international concern, the sixth international public health emergency since the first implementation of the measure during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, following the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries.
Who Director-General OftheTa said public health emergencies of international concern were based on "global spread risks, particularly to low- and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems".
Responding to the imposition of travel restrictions, Mr Tandese said there was "no reason to take unnecessary intervention seduthing on international travel and trade" and that "the World Trade Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".
On February 5, the World Health Organization called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic readiness in low-income countries, saying there was an urgent need to support countries that "do not have a companion system to test people with viral infections."
In a statement, Mr. Tan said that "the weakest link determines how strong we are" and urged the international community to "commit immediately or at greater cost in the future". On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed at a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Mr. Tandese said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed that "the United Nations will do its utmost to deal with the outbreak".
To that end, the United Nations has launched the United Nations Crisis Management Group to coordinate the Response of the United Nations as a whole. The World Health Organization says this allows WHO to "focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to address the wider social, economic and development altogether impact of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint mission led by the World Health Organization of China was launched to send international and Who experts to the field in China to assist in responding to local outbreaks and assess "the severity and contagious ness of the disease" through seminars and meetings with key national agencies, and to assess "the impact of provincial and county response activities, including different situations in urban and rural areas". On February 25th the World Health Organization declared that "greater global efforts should be made to prepare adequately for a possible coronavirus pandemic" and noted that countries should still be "in reserve" although it is too early to call a pandemic.
In response to iran's evolving outbreak, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation. On February 28th World Health Organization officials said they had raised the global risk level for the coronavirus outbreak from "high" to "high", which is also the highest alert and risk level for the assessment method.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement: "This is a reality check for governments around the world: wake up.
The virus may be approaching, be prepared" and urge governments to do the right thing to avoid a "worst-case scenario" around the world.
Ryan went on to point out that the current data are not enough for public health officials to declare a global pandemic, and that such a announcement would mean "we basically recognize that everyone on The planet may be exposed to the virus." "
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared a new outbreak of the coronavirus to constitute a global pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization said he was "deeply concerned about the thought-provoking spread and severity of the situation and the reality of inaction". The World Health Organization has been heavily criticized for its perceived mishandling of the global pandemic, including delaying the declaration of a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.
Among the more vocal objections was a petition calling for the resignation of Who Director-General Tedros Adhanom, which had been signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the need to respect everyone's rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group noted that everyone had the right to life-saving interventions, and that the Government should assume that responsibility.
The Group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should in no way be a justification for discrimination against specific groups.
Experts stressed that everyone enjoyed the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, groups living in extremely poor conditions, detainees and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are actively responding to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform designed to provide timely comprehensive information and ideas and recommendations on policy responses around the world.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to addressing the impact of closures and travel restrictions, the digital centre has a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and promote global collaboration to address the challenges of new coronaviruses.
As the pandemic first erupted in China's Hubei province, Michael Gove, the secretary of the U.S., British Cabinet Office, and Eduardo Bossonaro, son of Brazilian President Yael Bosonaro, criticized the Chinese government's handling of the affair.
Several provincial officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been removed from their posts for mishandling epidemic prevention efforts in central China, reflecting the central government's dissatisfaction with the local political agency's response to the outbreak.
Some commentators say the move is aimed at avoiding public discontent with Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) central committee, over the new outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have denied earlier claims that the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan and support conspiracy theories that the new coronavirus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called the new coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," said China's "censorship system has exacerbated the spread of the virus and turned it into a global pandemic today," which in turn has been seen by some critics as racial discrimination and "distracting attention from his administration's failure to contain the virus."
The Daily Beast obtained a cable from the U.S. government outlining a communications strategy clearly sent by the National Security Council, which said "it's all out of China."
We are told to disseminate this message in any way, including press conferences and television appearances," he said. Media outlets such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claim that China's aid to affected countries is intended to promote its global influence.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, warned that there was a "geopolitical factor, including the use of good offices and "generous politics" to compete for influence" .
"China is touting it as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States," Borrel said. "
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and is said to have provided assistance to the latter two countries.
On April 3, Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of transferring aid to other countries to their home countries.
There are also reports of disputes over masks between Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as other countries such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey intercepted hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU for not supporting Italy, which is affected by the new coronavirus.
"Only China has responded bilaterally," said Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the Eu.
This is, of course, not a good sign of European unity. "
On March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian troops to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister John Conte.
The Italian newspaper El Pais quoted an anonymous "senior political official" as saying that 80% of Russia's aid was "almost useless to Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm offensive.
Lombardi's governor, Attilio Fontana, and Italy's foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane to the United States carrying medical aid.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "In providing assistance to his U.S. counterparts, he believes that once U.S. medical equipment and materials manufacturers resume production, they will pay off if necessary." "
The NATO "Defender20 2020" military exercise, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea, is the largest since the end of the Cold War and will be scaled back.
Kate Hudson, secretary-general of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticised the Defenders 2020 exercise: "At a time of global public health crisis, the exercise endangers not only the lives of the United States and many European national military personnel involved, but also the lives of the countries in which the exercises are conducted." "The Iranian government has been badly affected by the outbreak, with about 24 members of Parliament and 15 other current or former political figures infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help. The letter noted that U.S. sanctions against Iran have prevented Iran from accessing international markets, making it difficult for Iran to fight the outbreak. The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political analysts expect the outbreak to have a negative impact on Donald Trump's ability to win re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated as a result of the global pandemic.
Japan announced that all people entering from South Korea would be subject to a two-week quarantine at a government-designated location, and South Korea later criticized Japan's "vague and passive quarantine measures."
South Korean society initially showed a polarizing attitude toward sway from President Moon E-moon's response to the crisis.
Many South Koreans signed the petition, with calls for impeachment, accusing the government of mishandling the outbreak and praising his response. The pandemic prompted many countries to pass emergency legislation as a response.
Some commentators worry that this could lead the government to tighten its grip on power.
In Hungary, parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Orban Victor ruling indefinitely by decree suspending parliament and elections, and punishing anyone found guilty of spreading false information about the virus and the government's crisis management.
A wide range of supply shortages can be attributed to a new coronavirus outbreak, stemming from increased equipment use, panic shopping and disruption of factories and logistics operations around the world in an effort to combat the outbreak.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning of shortages of medicines and medical devices due to increased consumer demand and disruption in supply.
Panic shopping has led to the emptying of essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water on shelves, causing shortages of supplies.
The tech industry, in particular, has been warning of delays in shipments of electronics.
World Health Organization Director-General Tandese says public demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand has led to a 20-fold increase in the price of such products and a four- to six-month delay in the supply of medical supplies.
It has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment. The World Health Organization has warned that this poses a threat to health care workers.
In Australia, the pandemic offers new opportunities for buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The campaign led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was banned by the Australian government. Although COVID-19 in northern Italy and Wuhan is very serious, there are no serious food shortages in these two regions.
Measures taken by China and Italy to target hoarding of key products and illegal trade have been successful, averting severe food shortages, while In Europe and North America are expected to occur.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not fallen significantly, but industry representatives believe prices could rise.
The emptying of food shelves is only temporary, even in Wuhan, where Chinese government officials have released pork reserves to protect residents' nutrition.
Italy has a similar law requiring food producers to stock up on such emergencies.
The global economic damage has already affected China: retail sales plunged 20.5 per cent in the first two months of 2020, according to a media report on March 16th, as a result of government-led outbreak containment measures.
Since Chinese mainland is the world's major economic and manufacturing hub, the outbreak is seen as a major threat to the stability of the global economy.
According to Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit, the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth could exceed the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the impact of the outbreak on global supply chains could be more than $300 billion, potentially lasting up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to be "struggling" after a sharp drop in oil prices as Chinese demand fell.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside of Chinese mainland.
On February 27th u.S. stock indexes, including the Nasdaq 100, the Standard and Poor's 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, all posted their biggest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, its biggest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis, amid growing fears of a new coronavirus outbreak.
All three indices fell more than 10% in the week.
On February 28th Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative outlook.
Fears of a new coronavirus caused the stock market to plunge again, with the biggest drop on March 16.
Many people think that a recession is a high probability event.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised central banks and states for taking timely and urgent measures.
Central banks have responded more quickly than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism has been one of the worst affected by travel bans, the closure of public places such as tourist attractions and government sedituates to avoid travel.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern and Qantas, cancelled flights due to falling demand, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The cruise industry has been hit harder than ever.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been forced to close.
The outbreak coincides with the Spring Festival holiday, which was supposed to be an important tourist season.
State and local governments have cancelled a series of events involving crowds, including the annual Spring Festival, and private companies have closed their own stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions, including the Forbidden City and the Traditional Temple Fair in Beijing, have been cancelled and closed to prevent large-scale crowdgatherings.
Twenty-four of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions extended the New Year holiday to February 10, requiring most businesses not to return to work until that date.
These regions account for 80 per cent of the country's gross domestic product and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong, China, raised its infectious disease response level to the highest level, declared a state of emergency, schools closed until March, and New Year's celebrations were cancelled. The retail sector has been affected globally, with store opening hours reduced or temporarily closed.
Retail store visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retail traffic in North America and the Middle East decreased by 50-60%.
In addition, the outbreak also caused the mall's traffic to drop 33-43% in March from February.
Mall operators around the world have taken additional steps, such as increasing sanitation facilities, installing heat scanners to measure shoppers' body temperature, and canceling some activities. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession triggered by the pandemic could result in 14 to 22 million more people living in extreme poverty in Latin America than in the absence of a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the Wuhan outbreak, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
China has nearly 300 million migrant workers, many of whom are stranded in inland provinces or Hubei provinces. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the new coronavirus outbreak could result in 47 million people in the United States losing their jobs and potentially 32 percent unemployment. India's blockade has led to the unemployment of tens of millions of migrant workers on a daily basis. The Angus Reed Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs since the blockade was imposed in Spain in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal benefits. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have adopted a government-subsidized, reduced-hours work system for their employees.
France and Britain have also adopted Germany's reduced-hours compensation system.
The performing arts and cultural industries have also been hit hard by the outbreak, with organizations operating around the world, as well as employed employees and individuals.
Arts and cultural organizations strive to uphold their mission (usually funded by the government) to showcase cultural heritage to communities, to safeguard the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, performing arts venues and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and scheduled exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response to this situation, the parties have embarked on a strong effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The outbreak has also recently led to the cancellation of many religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows, and the negative impact can quickly increase.
The film industry has also taken a hit. The Vatican has announced the cancellation of holy week commemorations to be held in Rome during the last week of Christian Ramadan.
Many parishes advise older Christians to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches hold services on radio, live or television, while others allow worship in cars.
Christian pilgrims are nowhere to be seen in St. Peter's Square because of the closure of their large and small churches in the Roman Catholic Diocese, and other religious groups have cancelled or restricted worship or limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and shrines.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in affected areas, and prayer sites were later forced to close, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the worst disruption to the world sports calendar since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 Champions League, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 National Hockey Federation season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled for the end of July, and the IOC announced on March 24that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker matches have been postponed or cancelled.
This in turn has led many gamblers to turn to online gambling, with several online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their new registration stakes. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling their tours.
Many large theatres, such as the Broadway Theatre, have also suspended all performances.
Some artists have also sought to continue to create and share their work through the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as live concerts or the creation of online "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work.
Online, many online fans with the theme of the new coronavirus have spread, and at a time when uncertainty is spreading, many people are turning to humor and distractions.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudice, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asians and people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries have increased.
Fear, suspicion and hatred have occurred in many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February, when most cases were still confined to China, documented racist feelings among different groups around the world about Chinese, arguing that Chinese should be infected with the virus or subject to so-called legitimate retaliation.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
It is reported that many residents of Wuhan and Hubei areas suffer from geographical discrimination.
Voices support Chinese and residents of areas with severe outbreaks, both online and online.
As the outbreak spreads to other hot spots, Italy becomes the first country in Europe to have a severe COVID-19 outbreak, and people from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a petition calling for Chinese to be banned from entering the country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the topic of #ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese don't come to Japan) on Twitter has spread widely.
Chinese and other Asians in the UK and us reported an increase in racial abuse and assault.

Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari, carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.
Students from north-eastern India, which borders China and study in major Indian cities, have also reportedly been harassed by a new outbreak of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP's West Bengal state, said Chinese destroyed nature, "so God will retaliate against them." "
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata as "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents have also been exacerbated by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and the target of "waste disposal".
Many newspapers with paywalls have lifted the limitons on some or all of the reports of the new coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have published a number of epidemic-related scientific papers.
Other scientists have chosen to quickly share their findings on preprintservers such as bioRxiv.

COVID-19 Workplace Prevention and Control
COVID-19 Workplace prevention and control refers to the use of occupational safety and health measures to prevent and control dangerous coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriateness of workplace hazard prevention and control depends on the specific job site and job assignment, and should be determined on the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the community disease, and the risk factors for vulnerable individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure risk work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues, so basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including frequent hand washing, encouraging home isolation after illness, observing respiratory etiquette, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Moderate exposure risk work includes the need for regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes staff who have access to the general public, such as schools, high-density working environments and some large-scale retail environments.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should use efficient air filters and sneezing guards for ventilation, personal protective equipment and other hazard prevention and control measures when exposed to COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers there is a high risk of exposure to health care workers and mortuary staff in known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and becomes extremely high if the staff performs aerosol-producing operations on known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collects or processes specimens from them.
Hazardous prevention and control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have a serious impact on the workplace.
Staff may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others, or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in demand for goods or changes in access to these items (e.g., shopping during off-peak hours or using delivery or ride-free delivery services).
Finally, product logistics from areas severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak may be disrupted. Infectious Disease Prevention and Response Plans can be used to guide conservation actions.
These programs address the level of risk associated with a variety of workplace and job tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from the family and community environment, and risk factors for self-employed workers, such as the elderly or groups with chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the prevention and control measures needed to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to be subject to national or local recommendations.
The objectives of responding to outbreaks include reducing employee-to-employee transmission, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response is affected by the severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located.
The hazard prevention and control level is a widely used framework for occupational safety and health prevention and control, which is used to group hazard prevention and control measures according to effectiveness.
If the harm of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control is the lowest implementation cost solution when it isolates employees from job-related hazards rather than relying on employee behavior to control them.
Administrative control s is a change in work policy or procedure that requires a staff member or employer to take action on its own.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has less prevention and control than engineering control and administrative control, but helps prevent some exposure.
All types of PPEs are selected according to the level of hazard faced by staff, are equipped as applicable (e.g. respirators) and must always be worn correctly, inspected and maintained regularly, replaced if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.
Basic infection precautions are recommended in all workplaces, including frequent hand washing, recommending home isolation for sick employees, respiratory etiquette when coughing or sneezing, providing paper towels and trash cans, preparing for telecommuting, getting the wrong commute if necessary, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and keeping the workplace clean and disinfected daily.
Timely identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors, and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees exhibiting acute respiratory symptoms be kept in isolation at home for at least 24 hours until they are determined to be free of fever, fever, and any other symptoms, and that sick leave policies should be implemented flexibly, allowing employees to take care of sick families at home, and should explicitly inform employees of the policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk work includes the need for frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within a 6-foot (1.8-meter) radius, but may result in an individual contracting SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission near the workplace or possible recent visits to the COVID-19 outbreak area.
Such staff include staff working in schools, high-density working environments and in some high-volume retail settings who have access to the general public. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include the installation of physical barriers such as efficient air filters, improved ventilation, transparent plastic sneezing guards, and the installation of exit-free windows to provide customer service. Administrative control over this and high-risk groups includes encouraging home isolation of sick and high-risk workers, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing faulty peak shifts, eliminating non-essential travel to COVID-19 outbreak sites, developing emergency communications plans, including response to staff questions, providing staff with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviour, and training staff who need to use protective clothing and protective equipment, Provide resources and working environments that contribute to personal hygiene, require frequent hand washing, restrict access to the work site for customers and the public, and post signs on hand washing and other COVID-19 protectionmeasures. At a minimum, staff at risk of moderate exposure should be equipped with personal protective equipment, including gloves, robes, masks or goggles, depending on the job.
Such staff are advised to be equipped with a respirator.
If a person is ill on board an aircraft, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including placing the patient 6 feet away from the other passenger, assigning a crew member to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask, or requiring the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick travellers, touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces. Cabin crew should also wear additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveller has symptoms such as fever, persistent coughing or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazard bags, followed by cleaning and disinfection of contaminated surfaces. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard prevention and control measures also include delaying travel in the event of illness. If fever or other symptoms occur on board, self-isolation should be isolated and immediately notified to the medical room on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be conducted in the compartment of the isolated person. For schools and childcare sites, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if an infected person has been present in the school, the school and childcare facilities should be closed for a short period of time to thoroughly clean or disinfect, regardless of the community's spread.
For low- and medium-level community communication, social distance strategies such as cancellation of field trips, rallies and physical education classes, choirs or restaurant meals, such as other large gatherings, increased distance between desks, false peak arrivals and departures, restrictions on non-essential visitor visits, and separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms can be arranged.
If community communication is severe, you may consider extending the suspension period in addition to implementing a social distance strategy. For law enforcement officials who perform routine routine activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the direct health risks to them to be low.
It is recommended that law enforcement officers who are in contact with a confirmed patient or suspected individual in contact with THE emergency medical technician be treated with the same level of protection, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, staff members should clean and disinfect their work belts and equipment before they can be cleaned and then used with household cleaning sprays or rags, and shall follow standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures, as well as clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA considers certain health care and introom staff to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-exposure workers include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation staff who are physically exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 infections.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if the staff performs a droplet generation procedure on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or if they collect or process specimens of infected or suspected infected persons.
Droplet generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or the collection of body cavity specimens.
High-exposure risk morgue staff include staff involved in the sorting of bodies of deceased people who were confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 before their deaths, and who are at higher risk of exposure if an autopsy is performed. Additional engineering measures for this risk group also include isolation rooms for COVID-19 confirmed or suspected cases, including when performing droplet generation procedures.
Some health-care facilities and morgues can also be equipped with specialized negative pressure ventilation systems.
Biosecurity Level 3 precautions should be taken when handling specimens.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that patients be drawn up different waiting areas based on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that people working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those performing the moth-generating procedure should wear respirators.
The United States requires the use of NIOSH-approved N95 filter masks or better masks in a comprehensive documented respiratory protection program such as health testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators provide better protection and increase staff comfort. THE WHO DOES NOT RECOMMEND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING BECAUSE COVID-19 IS A RESPIRATORY DISEASE AND IS NOT TRANSMITTED THROUGH BODILY FLUIDS.
THE WHO RECOMMENDS THAT ENTRY POINT SCREENING PERSONNEL ONLY NEED TO WEAR A MEDICAL SURGICAL MASK.
Whorecommends the use of medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes, and gloves for staff who need to collect breathtaking samples from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without performing droplet generation procedures.
If you are performing a droplet generation procedure, you must replace the medical surgical mask with an N95 or FFP2 mask.
In view of the global shortage of personal protective equipment, WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, allowing only direct caregivers to enter the ROOM of COVID-19 patients, using it only when it is necessary to use personal protective equipment on specific tasks, continuing to use the same respirator when caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the personal protective equipment supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic sists.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more than a million people worldwide
The total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded 1 million on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths are related to coVID-19, a disease caused by coronaviruses.
On the same day that the milestone occurred, Malawi confirmed the country's first case of coronavirus infection and Zambia's first case of coronary virus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea said it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 105,1635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the 24 hours leading up to 10 a.m. Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
On Wednesday, a coronavirus infection killed more than 1,000 people in the United States, CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the closure to May 1.
President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians across the country will continue to be paid during the shutdown until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days;
Saudi Arabia extended a curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to a full-day curfew, which was previously only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the home order until May 1.
2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throats, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The incubation period from contact to onset ranges from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some cases develop viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases and more than 153,000 deaths have been reported in 210 countries and territories worldwide.
More than 568,000 people have been rehabilitated by treatment. The virus is mainly transmitted from person to person through close contact and is often spread by droplets from coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Although exhalation produces droplets, droplets usually fall on the ground or on the surface of various objects and do not cause long-range infections.
In addition, if someone touches a surface contaminated with the virus and then touches their nose and nose, they may also be infected with the virus.
Viruses can survive on the surface of an object for up to 72 hours.
Although the pre-incidence and late recovery may also spread, but the first three days of the disease is the most contagious. The standard diagnostic method is to perform a real-time reverse transcriptus polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test of nasopharyngeal swabs.
People suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations for the public to wear masks vary from place to place, with some authorities opposing the wearing of masks and others requiring them to be worn.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The vast majority of all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
People with viral infections may be asymptomatic and may develop suspected flu symptoms such as fever, cough, weakness, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or chest tightness, blurred consciousness, difficulty waking and bruising of the face or lips;
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.
Different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are also detected.
In some cases in China, only chest tightness and palpitations were shown.
Some cases can develop into viral pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and even death.
We call this the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may be extended to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected people develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Not all infected people develop symptoms, the report said.
The role of asymptomatic infected persons in the spread of the outbreak is not yet fully defined;
The proportion of asymptomatic people infected has not yet been determined and research is being stepped up. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 percent of the confirmed cases showed no symptoms during hospitalization.
China's National Health And Wellness Board has included asymptomatic cases in its daily notification since April 1; Asymptomatic when tested.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large amounts of the virus.
Speak loudly and splash more droplets than normal speech.
An unobstructed cough can cause droplets to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet), a study in Singapore has found.
Although such viruses generally do not spread through the air, the National Academy of Sciences has determined that they may be transmitted through bioaeroas, and air collectors in corridors outside the wards have tested positive samples of viral RNA.
Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR can atomize respiratory secretions, which in turn can cause airborne transmission.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but the risk is considered low. When a patient develops symptoms, the virus is the most contagious and, although it may spread before the symptoms occur, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that while the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet clear, it is common for 1 person to infect 2-3 people. The virus survives on the surface of an object for a range of hours to days.
Specifically, the new coronavirus is known to survive one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% pure copper products.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soap and detergent can also kill the virus. Soap products degrade the fat protective layer of the virus, making it inactive, while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as ammonium benzodiazepines and chlorohexanate( an surgical disinfectant, are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China, showed that saliva samples were taken on average two days after admission.
5/6 patients had the highest viral load in the first sample, and 1/6 of the patients detected the highest viral load the next day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three patients with pneumonia in a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presentin in the associated coronaviruses of nature.
Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with household soap, which destroys the virus's protective sac. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the highest in lung type II alveolicells.
The virus binds to ACE2 and enters the host cell through a special surface glycoprotein called "sting" (sac particle).
Of the patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, 12% of those infected found to have acute cardiomyopathy, with a higher proportion of patients with severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are higher due to systemic inflammatory reactions and immune system disorders caused by the worsening of the disease, but acute cardiomyopathy may also be associated with the heart's ACE2 receptors.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and participate in regulating heart function.
It is reported that THE ICU monitoring of COVID-19 infected blood clots (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) The high incidence may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsies of patients with COVID-19 deaths found diffuse alveoli damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-inflammatory immersion in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is ehabitable to respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE2, patients with COVID-19 severe disease experience an over-inflammatory response throughout the body.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretion of T cells in patients with COVID-19 is associated with the collection of inflammatory IL-6 secretion mononucleosis and severe lung pathology.
Autopsy reports also show lymphocyte sipped.
THE WHO HAS PUBLISHED SEVERAL DISEASE DETECTION PROGRAMS.
The standard detection method is the use of real-time reverse transcriptus polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test usually detects respiratory samples taken from nasopharyngeal swabs;
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be performed, but two weeks apart between two blood samples, with little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing reagents to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing ,which can detect not only active infections but also individuals who have been infected in the past) is still under development, but has not yet been rolled out.
According to China's experience, detection accuracy is only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. FDA approved the first immediate diagnostic reagent and was put into service at the end of the month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Early infectionis are common in double lung polyleaf-grinding glass shadow, with peripheral asymmetric and post-part cloth.
With the development of the virus, there may be sub-thoracic dominant, gravel signs (small leaf interval thickening with varying degrees of alveoli filling) and pulmonary reality.
Little information on COVID-19 micropathological injuries and pathophysiology is scarce.
The main pathology findings of the autopsy are as follows:
Visual examination: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary change and pulmonary edema
Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell proliferation, large numbers of atypical lung cells, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte immersion and the formation of polynuclear megacells
Severe pneumonia: Diffuse alve olive lacrosse (DAD) with diffuse alve oligoscosis.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Recovery pneumonia: alveolar fluidization and pulmonary fibrosis in the alveoli cavity
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DIC);
Precautions that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and if you don't have a tissue, cover the inside of your elbow.
It is recommended to clean the hand hygiene properly after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends wearing a cloth mask in public to some extent prevent asymptomatic patients from spreading the virus. At the heart of the strategy of maintaining a social distance is closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and eliminating large public gatherings, thereby reducing the chances of infection and large-scale community contact.
In addition, the Social Distance Guidelines state that you should maintain a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) from your interpersonal relationships.
There are no effective drugs to prevent COVID-19. With the vaccine not expected to be available until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak outbreak are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, known as the "flattening epidemiological curve."
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with significant dirt on their hands, before mealtimes, and after snot, coughing, or sneezing.
It is also recommended to wash your hands with alcohol-containing hand sanitizer slower at least 60%, but only when there is no soap or running water around. For areas where water-free hand sanitizers cannot be purchased, WHO offers two formulations for in-place production.
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol;
Add glycerin as a moisturizer.
Supportive care for people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and other critical organ support affected.
The CDC recommends that suspected carriers of the virus wear simple masks.
In vitro membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to relieve respiratory failure symptoms, but its benefits are still to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain personal hygiene and promote healthy lifestyles and eating habits to improve immunity.
Supportive therapy may be effective in patients with early-stage infection. THE WHO AND THE NATIONAL HEALTH COUNCIL OF CHINA HAVE LAUNCHED AN INITIATIVE CALLING FOR PROPER CARE OF COVID-19 PATIENTS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL.
U.S. critical care and lung specialists have compiled treatment recommendations from agencies and are available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, NO COVID-19 special effecttherapy has been developed.
For some symptoms, some medical experts recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line treatment.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission and to perform operations that may produce aerosols in a medical setting, such as intubation or hand ventilation, with particular attention to protection.
For health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that patients be transferred to the Airborne Infectious Diseases Isolation Unit (AIIR) in addition to standard precautions, exposure precautions, and airborne prevention measures. The CDC provides an overview of guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an outbreak.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If you can, it's best to use a respirator instead of a mask.
N95 masks are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is primarily used to prevent inhalation of suspended particulates (e.g. dust), but is used for other purposes without guaranteeing effective isolation of specific biological agents.
If you don't have a mask, the CDC recommends using a mask and, if necessary, a homemade mask.
Most CASES OF COVID-19 have mild symptoms and do not require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a percentage of cases require such measures.
Health care providers are actively working on a study that hopes to provide respiratory support to PATIENTs with COVID-19 who develop symptoms of respiratory failure. There is evidence that intubation can be avoided through nasal high-flow oxygen therapy or bipolar positive pressure ventilation.
It is not clear whether these two treatments will have the same effect on severe patients.
If conditions permit, some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, as this technique can also limit the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to high-flow oxygen therapy through the nose. Severe cases are mainly among the elderly (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries have insufficient beds per capita, and the health system is unable to cope with the dire situation of hospital admissions due to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases due to limited medical conditions.
A study in China found that 5% of patients need to be sent to intensive care, 2.3% need mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% will die as a result.
About 30% of COVID-19 admissions in China end up in the ICU.
With the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, mechanical ventilation complexity has been further enhanced and oxygenation has become more and more difficult.
A ventilator with a pressure control mode and a high PEEP is required to maximize the delivery of oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung damage and chest damage caused by ventilators.
Legacy ventilators may not be able to achieve high PEEP.
Research on potential therapies has been under way since January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
Redsivir seems to be the most promising drug of the day.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other purposes or are in the advanced testing phase.
People with severe illness can try antiviral drugs.
WHO calls on volunteers to participate in trials of potential therapeutic effectiveness and safety. The FDA has provisionally authorized the recovery period plasma transfusion as an experimental treatment for critically ill patients with life-threatening lives.
The necessary clinical studies have not yet been carried out to demonstrate whether the treatment is safe and effective in treating the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to contain the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number upon request.
The app detects "close contact" by monitoring data to determine the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
Once a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also alerts local health officials. A combination of mobile data data data analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected people and those they come into contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track cell phone data for suspected coronavirus carriers.
The purpose of this measure is to enforce segregation and to protect groups that may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated mobile phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who violate quarantine rules.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, points out that mobile phone operator data shows that "40 per cent of citizens are still moving around".
The German government has hosted a 48-hour weekend hackathon involving more than 42,000 people.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of an infection can all be troubling.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying that "social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are the perfect storms to hurt people's mental health and well-being." "
The disease is mild and has few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Minor cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases can take three to six weeks to recover.
According to other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 severe illness, but lack COVID-19 data support. COVID-19 MAY AFFECT SOME PEOPLE'S LUNGS, WHICH IN TURN CAN CAUSE PNEUMONIA.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, blood clotting abnormalities, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital had blood clotting abnormalities, especially the prolonged coagulation enzyme, and 4% of patients in the group had abnormal kidney function.
About 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have elevated liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the average time from onset to death is ten days, of which the average length of hospitalization is five days.
However, the average time between admission and death in patients transferred to the ICU is seven days.
Early case studies have found that the average time from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with an overall time range of 6 to 41 days.
A study by China's National Health And Wellness Board (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
An autopsy lung sample histopathological examination showed diffuse alfomes damage associated with cell fiber mucus-like secretions in both lungs.
Viral cell lesions were observed in lung cells.
The lung image is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by China's National Health Board, 11.8% suffered heart damage due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to U.S. data released in March, 89% of admissions have a history of past disease. The availability of medical resources and regional socio-economic conditions may also affect mortality.
The results of the mortality estimates vary due to regional differences and methods.
Underestimating cases of mild illness can lead to overestimation of mortality.
However, if the case death is due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop COVID-19 severe illness and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than nonsmokers. Concerns have been raised about the long-term after-effects of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority of China found that some recovered persons had a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in lung capacity, and lung scans showed organ damage.
In addition, after rehabilitation may face post-intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is uncertain whether past infections will enable recovered persons to obtain effective long-term immunity.
Immunity may be found based on the behavioral characteristics of other coronaviruses, but some COVID-19 cases have been reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus shortly after recovery.
These cases are believed to be a continuing deterioration of the infection rather than reinfection.
The virus, believed to be a natural virus, originated in animals and is infected by overflows.
The actual origin has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the scope of infection is almost entirely human-to-human transmission.
The first 41 confirmed CASES OF COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 showed that the earliest onset date was December 1, 2019.
The earliest onset reported in WHO official publications is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and vary over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the timing of the outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed sars-CoV-2 infection deaths, and U07.2 to clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 but not laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths. The fatality rate is equal to the total number of deaths within a given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.
As of April 17, 2020, the global fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191), according to Johns Hopkins University.
The fatality rate varies from region to region. Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflect the percentage of deaths from disease as a percentage of confirmed cases, and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of disease deaths (including confirmed and undiagnosed) infections.
These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process of specific populations from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people infected.
Italy's outbreak centre, Castiglione d'Adda, is a small town of just 4,600 people with 80 (1.7%) died in the outbreak.
In Gangelt, the outbreak spread sours through carnival days and even affects young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
Moreover, Germany's health-care system is overwhelmed.
The blood donor assessment indicates that about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
To date, 69 people (0.004% of the total population) have been confirmed to have died in COVID-19.
The impact of the outbreak and mortality rates vary by gender.
Studies in China and Italy have shown that men have a higher mortality rate than women.
Men aged 50-60 had the highest risk of death, with a similar gender gap in the 90-year-old age group.
The mortality rate in China is 2.8% for men and 1.7% for females.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unclear, but may be due to genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower smoking rates among women and lower rates of age in men with comorbidities (such as hypertension) have led to higher mortality rates among men than in women.
In Europe, 57% of male infections and 72% of all coVID-19 deaths are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Women health workers(especially nurses) are higher and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease "COVID-19".
Who's director, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explains this: CO stands for "corona," VI stands for "virus," D stands for "disease" and 19 represents the time of the outbreak (December 31, 2019).
This name was chosen to avoid referring to specific geographic locations (e.g., China), animal species or populations to comply with international naming recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "coVID-19 virus" in mass transmission.
Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary virus and disease names, based on 2015 guidelines on where to use in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers began printing health care materials such as nasal swabs and respirator components.
An Italian hospital, for example, is in dire need of ventilation valves, suppliers are unable to deliver parts within the required time, and a local start-up reverse-engineering to print out the required 100 ventilation valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease spread rapidly through the network.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study found no evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines for the treatment of the disease have been approved.
Government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers are actively conducting international research to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity trial" to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of the four existing antiviral compounds that are currently most likely to produce efficacy.
There is no vaccine at the time, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through ACE2 receptors, the previous work of SARS-CoV is therefore required.
Three vaccine strategies are being studied.
First, the researchers plan to develop a vaccine for the whole virus.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, is designed to trigger a rapid immune response in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop a subunit vaccine aimed at developing a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to react sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such studies focused on the S-sting protein stomp protein snare that assists the virus intruciting the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is to develop a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the experimental vaccine developed by the above strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first vaccine clinical trial.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic sequences copied from disease-causing viruses. It has long been argued that antibody-dependent enhancement may be a major challenge in the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials have been conducted.
Seven trials were evaluated and approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Conversion of antiviral drugs accounts for the vast majority of research in China, and nine Phase III clinical trials of Redsiwe will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates has begun. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently being evaluated, including Redsivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/litonevir and the lopinavir/litonevir combination interferon beta.
As of March 2020, Redsewe's efficacy has been tentatively confirmed.
It was observed that the clinical symptoms of patients treated with the sympathetic drug Redseve were alleviated.
Phase III clinical trials are currently under way in the United States, China and Italy. In February 2020, China launched a study of chloroquine, which used to treat malaria, and achieved preliminary results.
However, there were calls for a peer review of the study.
The use of chloroquine is recommended by health authorities in South Korea and China.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1 gram a day, while warning that double the dose is dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to treat COVID-19 patients with these two drugs. The seventh edition of China's guidelines also proposes the use of interferon, ribavirin or abidor hydrochloride to treat COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin inhibit editing of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
After confirming the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to use nitrosnit for further invivia studies. Studies have shown that the primary prickly protein sydgine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a necessary condition for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with ACE2 receptors into the body.
Whether or not used in combination with amycin, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies have serious limitations and are not acceptable to the medical community unless further research is carried out. Oseltamivir has no inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has not been found to have therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be a complication of later treatment in patients with COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anticytokinetic storm properties. After completing a small study, China's National Health And Wellness Board included tozhuzumab in its treatment guidelines.
Following the positive test results of severe illness patients, Italy is conducting a national phase 2 non-randomization trial.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests, the identification of cytokine storms is designed to contain the development of the disease, which is thought to cause the death of some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved the use of leukocyte interleukin 6 receptor antagonists for other causes of steroid refractive cytokine release syndrome, or CAR T cell therapy, supported by retrospective case studies.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tobead supremtag is effective in treating CRS.
Research is under way to extract purified concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of COVID-19 rehabilitation sourcing them into people who need them as passive immunotherapy before the vaccine is successfully developed.
This strategy was tried during the SARS outbreak, but the efficacy has not yet been determined.
Viral neutralizing is an expected mechanism of action for passive antibody therapy to mediate SARS-CoV-2 immune defense.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis can achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The amount of serum produced during rehabilitation may increase, which is conducive to rapid deployment. The serum consists of a liquid part of the blood of a recovered patient and contains specific antibodies against the virus.
Coronary virus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan City Center Hospital, raised awareness of the spread of the new coronavirus, and later contracted COVID-19 and died.
Australian stores lower limit on the number of toilet paper per trade
On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australian chains Woolworths and Coles lowered the national limit for each transaction of toilet paper in all of its stores to two packs and one pack.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted as messages at the cash register or posted to the chain's Facebook page.
Buyers are hoarding goods for fear of COVID-19 in case they need to isolate themselves, the report said.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the number of toilet paper purchases delivered to the door to a single package.
The changes follow the introduction by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively, a limit of four packs per transaction.
In its March 8 press release, Coles reported that "many stores are still sold out within an hour of arrival" after the four-pack limit was imposed, adding that demand was "unprecedented" and THAT ALDI had said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that it was "unexpected."
According to a Woolworths spokesman, sales "surged" last week.
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two packs.
To further ease the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, with Woolworths ordering additional inventory and ALDI pre-prepared for the planned Wednesday offer.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventories, but local councils' restrictions on truck delivery times made it difficult.
He expects production costs to rise and special offers to fall as suppliers try to meet demand.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores would not be able to hold Wednesday specials after the early release of their inventory.
In a report by news.com.au, Queensland University of Technology retail expert Dr Gary Mortimer said stores replenished their inventory every night.
Toilet paper is a large item, he says, so there is less inventory, and once sold out, it leaves huge shelf space, adding to the sense of shortage.
"The view of Coles and Woolworths is that if there are a lot of things on the shelves, items like roll paper and hand sanitizer that are available and in sufficient quantities, you may not be so panicked. Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent toilet paper, both stress that they are working around the clock and working on weekends to secure supplies, news.com.au reported.
Property website Domain.com reports that some property developers will offer free toilet paper to first bidders at auctions in Melbourne as buyers take a labor day break and hold fewer auctions.
NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, has eight pages in its Thursday edition, intended for cutting and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to impose restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other goods is also high, including masks, hand sanitizer, dry goods, hand sanitizer and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Ocado, the UK's online supermarket, capped the purchase of Andres toilet paper at two packs of 12 volumes on Sunday night.

This month, we have had some difficult situations.
In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, we clearly feel the fate of all mankind, while recognizing our responsibility to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best response to this challenge requires people around the world to empathise, work together, and drive communities, which is a core philosophy of Wikimedia.
The love and care of all our colleagues through e-mail, phone and chat is a testament to the extraordinary differences of our colleagues and how we are privileged to work with you.
I am extremely grateful and proud to be a colleague to all of you.
Last week, there was appreciation for our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is that Wikipedia is available all over the world at this time, and what it means to keep this critical resource running for people around the world.
Whether your job is for website operations, payroll or community security, Wikimedia's normal operation depends on the hard work of your stoush.
The world needs information from Wikipedia more than ever.
At this stage, the content of our work and even the way of our work will have an important impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities of our colleagues, we will begin making some important adjustments to our collaborative approach starting next week.
How to work and schedule adjustments
As Robyn noted earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss how the company will work and schedule over the next few days and months.
At the meeting, we considered what we consider edifility to address the company's current challenges and best practices to ensure that the company remains sustainable during the outbreak.
The executive team agreed to reduce stress for the company's employees so that they can support the company's mission in the long term.
We support you to reduce the stress of your work appropriately.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week) and will be notified of any further changes.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer hours a day, we'll schedule tasks for you as long as you work.
However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will prioritize your personal needs, such as caring for your family, going out shopping, or seeing a doctor.
We don't track your working hours.
If you are ill, please put down your work.
This is self-evident, but we would like to remind you, please rest assured.
You don't need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform your manager and help your team modify your work calendar and schedule to make sure critical areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of Talent and Culture Operations that the department will support you and ensure that your situation is properly monitored by management.) )
For hourly employees, we pay the full salary.
We have stated and renewed our commitment to the commitments made to our contractors and hourly workers.
The salaries we pay to everyone will continue to be calculated in accordance with the remuneration they receive during normal normal normal business hours.
Even if you're sick or unable to work.
If you are willing to work, we will support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through their work, releasing their own stress.
Our work can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
But taking care of yourself is still the first priority.
We ask you to keep in touch with your manager so that we can keep up to date with you and make adjustments.
Priority is given to safeguarding important work.
We must keep some important work running.
The work done by the Site Reliability Engineering team, the Human Resources Operations team, the Trust and Security team, and the fund-raising team (and the other teams) is critical and may require additional support.
We will begin to work with all departments to assess the current objectives and shift our focus to supporting some of the issues that are critical to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down temporarily will not affect future development.
We don't plan to "work overtime" after the outbreak.
We're not going to ask you to work overtime to catch up, because that doesn't seem practical now.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.
How will the APP (Annual Plan) change?
In order to adapt to the new realities and daily schedule requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for the 2020-2021 plan.
We want to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 program in exchange for more time to budget, allowing employees to prioritize critical tasks and take care of themselves and their families, and to adjust work arrangements for those who need or want to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.
Extending the schedule can significantly reduce the current planning workload and reduce work pressure across the organization.
We will present the proposal to the board next week. If the proposal is approved, we will update the follow-up work arrangements with delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this process.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague from the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precaution, we hired some antiviral cleaners to thoroughly disinfect the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade disinfection solutions to disinfect a variety of surfaces and halls and elevators leading to our floors.
The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement to use the product to keep tenants safe.
We believe that when everyone decides to return to work, the office is fully prepared to meet everyone.
Our Washington, D.C. office uses the WeWork office, which shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all D.C. staff.
As of last week, the D.C. office had moved to full telecommuting, in line with the guidance we shared with our San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some of our colleagues in the New York office already know, we have been discussing the issue of renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing, but may be postponed.
Some colleagues are in contact with telecommuting for the first time.
Other long-distance telecommuting colleagues want to advise them on how to adjust their work:
The meeting time should be limited to one to two hours.
For longer periods of time, consider spreading the content of the meeting across multiple dates.
Clearly define meeting objectives, set the agenda for the meeting, and send reading materials in advance.
Use video conferencing as the default way to meet while using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom for online collaboration and contact.
In each meeting, arrange for a host to chair the meeting, arrange for one person to monitor the questions in the chat window and track the changes in the speaker list, and arrange for another person to be responsible (or multiplayer) to help with the minutes of the meeting.
If you need comfortable headphones, please contact Technical Support by email.
Use your health supplement to buy snacks.
Join the channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations team is working on ergonomic sorority in the form of webinars to help foundation colleagues be more productive during distributed work.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as Edit Song, before the WHO announced the outbreak.
These requests for cancellation and other restrictions may result in these community contributors not being able to complete their original contribution activities, and we have informed them that we understand this, while also promising that none of them will be punished for delaying or modifying these goals.
Over the next week, we will continue to provide additional guidance at Wikimania and other regional community meetings and thematic community meetings.
Global communities now seem to be shrouded in grief from the devastation of the outbreak, but they also reflect relief at the need to be able to clearly focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on the Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and track community interactions with us.
Stay in touch and communicate WITH COVID-19 related issues
We plan to hold a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 (World Time) /07:00 (Pacific Time) and we'll send the invitation to your calendar later.
At the meeting, we'll share some updates, answer your questions, and set aside some time for discussion.
We are united and here we are here to help you.
In the meantime, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT team updates these pages in a timely manner and brings all the information together in one place.
We are seeking to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries that are currently severely affected by the outbreak.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, major workflows or insurance, or need other help, feel free to contact and work with the CRT team.
We are here to provide you with the support and contact you need.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please email Bryan Judan, Head of Global Human Resources Operations.
Although we face these changes, we cannot give up our work and obligations as a result.
On the contrary, the outbreak has made us realize that we may now need to adjust our work and obligations in ways we have not had before.
We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to support each other in continuing to do our jobs, to provide the support we need for our actions, and to continue to bring the services on which they depend to the world.
Always plan well so you can't be afraid of challenges.
Now, please support each other and create space for important work in the coming weeks and months.
We need everyone to contribute to this goal, so please take care of yourself and your family so that you can be at your best when you need it.
Finally, please remember to wash your hands frequently and not touch your face.
Katherine, crT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) with the other members of the leadership team (Grant I, W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N) on the leadership team.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team released the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Rapid Recommendations for diagnosis and Treatment of Infection, which provides lessons for global responses to outbreaks.
However, 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease that is increasingly developing based on ongoing research and clinical experience;
In this letter, we responded to an opinion on the above guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic Programme (seventh edition) issued by the National Health AndI Of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has been officially named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was previously named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendations guide, which was published online February 06, 2020 in the journal Military Medical Research.
Since its release, it has attracted widespread attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new type of disease, and our awareness of the disease is increasing based on ongoing research and clinical experience;
For example, the National Health And Wellness Board of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published seven versions of the COVID-19 clinic between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which have already undergone substantial changes.
Now, our guidelines have received input from Zhou et al, who have come up with a simple scoring scheme based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidelines and a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We recognize and appreciate the important work they have done.
However, their proposals also need to be updated in the run-up to the latest COVID-19 protocol (Trial Phase VII) and recent studies.
According to The Seventh Edition (March 3, 2020), the diagnosis of a suspected case requires a combination of an epidemiological history characteristic with two clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis, and in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical manifestations are met:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or residence history in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities with COVID-19 cases reported within 14 days of symptoms; Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan and other communities reported to have COVID-19 have a history of exposure, and (4) have a history of exposure to clustered confirmed cases (in the 2 weeks prior to the onstheon of symptoms, 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school classes, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) have imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection, and (3) the total number of white blood cells in the early stages of onset is normal or decreased, and the lymphocyte count decreases.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases and have any of the following pathogen or serotonin evidence: (1) SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR test positive; 4 x, higher than the acute period.
As we can see, the second and third releases (January 22, 2020) have increased real-time PCR nucleic acid testing in respiratory or blood samples.
The fourth and fifth editions (February 8, 2020) added blood sample pathogen testing;
These changes are based on the researchers' ongoing work on the best nucleic acid testing kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens, including blood collection, which increase the availability of different specimens and provide evidence for the inclusion of positive results of specific antibodies into the diagnostic criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence to alert us to atypical symptoms and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people withnostic symptoms as "low risk."
In addition, the scoring system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we would like more direct evidence and appeal to readers for their comments.
For diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that you refer to and follow the latest guidelines for the country in which the case is located.
Our team will also update our guide to help.
Bangladesh reports 5 new COVID-19 deaths, new high in single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed the same day the addition of COVID-19 deaths 5 cases.
This is the highest single-day death toll from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Institute (IEDCR) had recorded 114 confirmed cases and 33 cases after rest at home.
A cumulative death toll was 17.
At an online news conference, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also said two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told local news outlet Anadolu Agency that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, head of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Roads, Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, announced via video link that public transport would be suspended beyond the original plan and extended to Saturday.
The public transport outage began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Basic supplies such as medical care, fuel and food are still transportable normally.
On 8 March, two of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh returned from Italy, and one of the other patients was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.
As of March 19, all three patients had recovered.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a continuing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic.
Although the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease and not to the risk level of a particular case, the WHO notes the need to urge governments to take action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are responding to testing, testing, treatment, isolation, tracing and mobilizing their people," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are deeply concerned about the alarming extent of proliferation and severity and the alarming extent of inaction. "
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
"Apart from the flu, no respiratory virus has been found to continue to spread globally after its presence," he said in a comment on CNN in February. "
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a coronavirus-induced pandemic before." "
"Similarly, we've never seen a virus pandemic that can be controlled before," he continued. "
The new state of the pandemic comes after the WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "the most important thing is that it's still getting worse." "
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 CASES of COVID-19 worldwide, killing more than 4,600 people.
Laboratory testing for 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes detecting the presence of the virus and whether antibodies are produced after infection.
RT-PCR detects RNA of coronaviruses and determines whether viruses are present in the sample.
This test is a specific test of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.
Can be used to determine if you have recently been infected or have an active infection.
Antibody testing (serotest) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody testing shows how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with mild symptoms that have not been reported or asymptomatic.
This test result can determine the exact fatality rate of the disease, as well as the level of mass immunity in the population.
Due to the limited number of tests, no country has been able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had more than 3% of its population, and the number of tests completed in each country varied widely.
This discrepancy may also have a serious impact on reported case mortality, which may be grossly overestimated in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection using throat swabs can only be performed within the first week of infection with the virus to obtain reliable results.
In general, results are available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with pharynx swabs can only be performed within the first week of infection with the virus to obtain reliable results.
After that, the virus disappears in the throat, but continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week after infection, the sample scancant can be replaced with a deep respiratory extract obtained through a sputum tube, or coughing (sputum) can be used.
The release of rRT-PCR, one of the early PCR tests, was released in January 2020 at the Charit? Hospital in Berlin, which was one of the early PCR tests and served as the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, a test method was also developed in the UNITED Kingdom. On January 28, 2020, Kogenebiotech, a Korean company, developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It looks for "E" genes common to all beta-coronaviruses, as well as the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the State Drug Administration of China for the production of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testkits. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resources Division.
Earlier versions of the test kit used three genetic tests, one of which resulted in a lack of results due to a reagent defect, and the Atlanta CDC experienced a testing bottleneck that resulted in an average of less than 100 successfulsamplecounts per day for the entire february of 2020.
The two-part test was not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, when state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
This test is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announces that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide as of March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also announced that COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits have been announced; sample collection and processing must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing is developed and produced by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research (VECTOR).
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federal Health Supervision Agency. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a kit that can detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, a testing method at Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA and can be performed in 3.5 hours, enabling a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for testing with Abbott's m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories, and the FDA previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, a test method that takes approximately 45 minutes for Cepheid was also granted emergency use by the FDA.
The FDA has approved a test that uses temperature amplification technology such as nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since the method does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, positive results can be obtained in only 5 minutes and negative results can be determined within 13 minutes.
With about 18,000 such units in the U.S., Abbott expects to increase production to deliver 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a test that uses monoclonal antibodies, specifically binding to the new coronavirus's n-protein, in the hope that it will provide test results in 15 to 20 minutes, as is the case with a fast flu test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of the chest tablets is small, and the performance of CT (computer tomography) may be significant, even before symptoms appear"
Typical features of CT include a double lung polyleaf-grinding glass shadow with peripheral asymmetric and post-part cloth.
As the disease progresses, it will develop underthal appearance, gravel signs and pulmonary reality.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan, where the current pandemic was the site of the initial outbreak, showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, but that CT was less accurate, and that many of its imaging characteristics overlapped with other pneumonia syllas and diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommends that "CT should not be used to screen COVID-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19." Starting in March 2020, the CDC recommends pcR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about 7 days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immunity of the monitored population. Measurements can be performed in a central laboratory (CLT) or through instant detection (PoCT).
These measurements can be performed by high-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by sequence dating samples, it is usually measured using a peripheral blood sample.
For PoCT, a blood sample is generally obtained with a skin puncture.
The extraction procedure is not required before the determination, which is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved 29 entity-declared testing methods that are now able to distribute their antibody testing kits.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one test under the Emergency Use Authorization. In late March 2020, the test kits of Ommon Medical Experimental Diagnostics AG and Epitope Diagnostics were approved in Europe to detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The detection capability can detect hundreds of samples in a matter of hours, so it is much faster to measure viral RNA than traditional PCR measurements.
In general, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody testing kits it had purchased were good enough.
Hong Kong has established a home-based mechanism for suspected patients to "provide sample test tubes in the emergency room" in which patients spit saliva into ivf and then send them back, where results will be received later. NHS England has announced that it is piloting a home-based programme to detect suspected cases, which would eliminate the risk of patients infecting others when they go to hospital and the risk that patients will have to disinfect them after using them. When testing suspected cases of COVID-19 without a drop-off, health care professionals can take appropriate precautions to extract samples.
The drop-off testing center has helped South Korea conduct faster and most extensive testing than any other country. In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2nd that non-inpatients were able to carry out about 12,000 tests a day, and 10,700 in the previous week.
If the test is performed at the request of the doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.
Germany's total weekly testing capacity is 160,000, according to the director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany.
As of March 19, a ride-free test has been available in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany is not known, as only the number of positive tests has been reported.
An initial laboratory survey showed that at least 483,295 samples (including the 12th week of 2020) had been detected by the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) had been detected. SARS-CoV-2 is positive. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for simultaneously testing samples of 64 patients, i.e. summary samples, and only further testing when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, Huada Gene (BGI) temporarily established a 2,000-square-meter emergency testing laboratory called Fire Eye, which opened on February 5, 2020 and can handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory, built five days under the supervision of Wang Jian, founder of China DaGene, showed that if the above testing capacity were not met, cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment and isolation costs would have doubled.
Following the Wuhan Laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately set up FireEye Labs, which are currently established in 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily flux of laboratory tests is 50,000 copies per day. The open source, multi-way design published by Origami Assay allows COVID19 testing of up to 1,122 patient samples with only 93 assays. These balanced designs operate in small laboratories without the need for automatic pipettes.
As of March, a shortage of reagents and a shortage of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EUROPEAN Union, the UK and the US.
This led some sponsors to explore sample preparation schemes that involved heating the sample to 98 degrees C (208 degrees F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on March 31st that it had now tested more of its population for the virus, more than any other country, and was expanding its testing levels to allow large numbers of people to be tested.
This testing capability is achieved by using drive-through testing on the one hand, and funding Group 42 and Huada Gene (based on its "fire eye" emergency testing laboratory in China) to create high-throughput laboratories to respond to large-scale crowd testing needs.
Built in 14 days and capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, the lab is the first laboratory in the world to operate on this scale outside China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have all developed different tests for various parts of the coronavirus gene map.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test kits to send kits to low-income countries that do not have their own.
The German approach was announced on January 17, 2020, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's program will be available until January 28, limiting U.S. testing capabilities. Both China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and both countries and Australia were unable to provide enough testing kits to meet demand and test recommendations from health experts.
In contrast, experts say extensive testing in South Korea has been instrumental in reducing the spread of new coronaviruses.
Thanks to the testing capabilities established by the Korean government over the past few years, it is concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programmes as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to a high demand for testing, which has led to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of swabs and chemicals has become strained.
In March 2020, China reported the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC were "defective" and the government subsequently removed bureaucratic barriers to private laboratory testing. Spain bought test boxes from Chinese company Shenzhen E-Ray Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and found that the test results were inaccurate.
The company explained that inaccurate test results may have been caused by improper collection of samples or the incorrect use of test kits.
Spain's cabinet said it would recycle the kits that returned the wrong results and replace them with another kit from Shenzhen Bioeasy. Eighty percent of the test boxes purchased from China by the Czech Republic are incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China and found it to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi?suggested that the test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. According to Ate?Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health, the test boxes purchased by Turkey from China have a "high error rate" and have not "put them into use". The UK bought 3.5 million test boxes from China and declared them unusable in April 2020.
Positive results can be achieved by testing and isolating people who test positive and tracking the exposure history of SARS-CoV-2-positive people.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V? , where the first COVID-19 patient died in Italy, tested groups of about 3,400 people in two rounds, each about 10 days apart.
About half of them tested positive and asymptomatic, and all cases were isolated.
New infections are completely eliminated by imposing travel restrictions on the community.
By tracking contacts on a large scale, restricting inbound travel, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus is spreading much slower in Singapore than in other developed countries, and Singapore has not resorted to extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled in Singapore and residents were advised to stay at home on 28 March, but schools resumed on time on March 23 after the holidays.
Several other countries, including Ireland and South Korea, have also controlled the pandemic through large-scale contact tracing, restricted inbound travel, detection and segregation, and less aggressive blockades.
A statistical study found that countries with higher numbers of tests, relative to the number of deaths, also had lower case mortality rates, possibly because they were better able to detect groups with only mild or asymptomatic symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited experience in handling COVID-19 in national laboratories send their first five positive and top 10 negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America, and 1 is in Australia.
In the chart below, the "Positive%" column is affected by the country's testing policy.
In other cases of the same conditions, countries that test editonly only for hospital spatients have a higher rate of positive testing than countries that test all citizens, whether or not they show symptoms.
The cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) between the EU/EEA and the UK increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020
In eu/EEA countries as well as in the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly, although different countries are at different stages.
In Italy's experience, the state, hospitals and intensive care units need to be better prepared to meet the surge in THE number of COVID-19 patients, with intensive care tasks particularly heavy.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centerfor Disease Control and Prevention reported that the pathogen is a new type of coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date shows that approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, respiratory infections that accompany or are not accompanied by pneumonia, and that most recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to critical condition and requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% progress to critical and intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 was approximately 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/European Economic Area (EU/European Economic Area) countries, as well as in the United Kingdom (UK), and compared them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
CASE OF COVID-19 IN EU/EEA COUNTRIES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM
After China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the current dynamicchange of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world is similar to that of China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of the journal European Monitoring, Spiteri et al reported the first confirmed CASES OF COVID-19 in Europe based on who's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on 24 January 2020, with the first three confirmed cases, from the returnees of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK as of 15 March 2020, and 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported from 31 December to 15 March 2019, including 1,727 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative number and incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country world at 8:00 a.m. daily, and they are available only from official sources, such as national health ministries, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
These data have been used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and have been compared with Italy.
We calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020 as an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases to take into account the natural course of COVID-19.
We also provided the total number of cumulative cases reported in each country as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, and compared the data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of 14-day constriction of cumulative incidence in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 increases from around 21 February 2020 and then increases dramatically around 28 February (supplementary material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries, as well as in the United Kingdom, shows a similar upward trend (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 and compared with Italy.
It is important to note that as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported by the EU/EEA and the UNITED Kingdom is increasing rapidly.
The observed trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the outbreak is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although individual countries have different stages of public health response, individual countries may have different definitions of cases, and the options for selecting patients who must undergo COVID-19 diagnostic testing, including additional testing, vary, but the same is the case.
In early March 2020, about 10% of COVID-19 patients in Italy were in intensive care, according to doctors in the affected regions of Italy, and media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had reached maximum load capacity.
At the EU/EEA level, the current available data are only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases in the intensive care unit (data are not shown).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of intensive care and medium-term care beds available in Europe varied widely, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and medium-term care beds per 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth update to the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment modeled the scenarios associated with saturation of healthcare capacity and estimated the relationship between the prevalence of each inpatient COVID-19 patient in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom and the risk of exceeding the number of intensive care beds by 90%.
Since cases have so far been concentrated in EU/EEA countries and certain areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve the coverage population of identified areas, it is best to provide information on cases and intensive care beds at the "Standard Statistical Geographical Unit 2" (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the EU/EEA and the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom are developing rapidly.
Therefore, the state, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the continued community spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially in intensive care, as in affected areas of Italy.
As recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment notes, a fast, positive, and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid growth in the number of cases may not give policy makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept, and adjust responses if not implemented ahead of time.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of pandemics.
There is a short window of opportunity that countries are likely to step up controls to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, health care systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge in patients in intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Origin of zoonotic disease in human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutation and resilience have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) flipped the situation and revealed the destructive and deadly nature of HCoV infections.
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has once again put CoV in the spotlight, surprisingly, because it is more contagious but less pathogenic than its sister virus, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease, so it would be helpful to understand the origins of HCoV's zoonotic disease.
Most HCoV sits and is non-pathogenic.
Some of HCoV's intermediate storage hosts are also known.
Identifying animal hosts is of direct significance for the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interactions of CoV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of human CoVs.
In this review, we provide an overview of the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, highlighting their history of discovery, the origin of zoonotic diseases, and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, we discussed the current outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, this paper also focuses on the requirements of successful host conversion and the impact of virus evolution on disease severity.
CoV is part of the coronary virus section and consists of a group of just single-stranded RNA viruses with a encapsulation.
These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, containing between 2.6 and 32,000 bases, and are known as "coV" because of their coronal form under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoV has a non-segmented genome that shares similar tissues.
About two-thirds of the genomecontains contain two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication enzyme polypolymers.
These polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to 16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs of structural proteins, including aphrite (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Many genealogy-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by CoV of different pedigrees.
Depending on the protein sequence, CoV is divided into four genus (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and gamma-CoV), where the beta-CoV genus contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Systemic developmental evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic sources of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the primary hosts of gamma-CoV and gamma-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has been crossing species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
To date, seven infectious coronaviruses (HCoV) have been known to infect humans.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other 5 beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as the common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, lead to severe lower respiratory infections in relatively large numbers of patients, and are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADS) and out-of-lung performance.
In the mid-1960s, the first hCoV-229E strain B814 was isolated from nasal secretions in patients with the common cold.
Since then, more knowledge has been gained from extensive research into both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which can cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the notion that infection with HCoV was usually harmless was widely accepted prior to the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 OUTBREAK of SARS was one of the most devastating events in history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude fatality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the outbreak continued to spread across the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.
The new HCoV virus 2019 (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is a continuing epidemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pathogens that have claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been raised and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, mice or domestic animals.
There is multiple evidence that all HCoV evolution originated in bats, where the virus is well adaptable and non-pathogenic, but exhibits great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 outbreak presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origin of zoonotic diseases of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces, and limiting factors of viral species jumping.
In addition, it will guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts, and expanded animal hosts, and will be important in preventing future virus spills.
In this review, we outline the origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of Zoonotic diseases of HCoV.
In particular, we emphasize and explore a common theme, namely, that HCoV's progenitor viruses are generally not pathogenic in their natural lysmic hosts, but are pathogenic after spreading across species to new hosts.
In addition, we reviewed the evolution of HCoV, where increased spreadability is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal CoV has been widely known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first separation of the HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal secretions of common cold patients, medical scientists had isolated different CoVs from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats, and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been discovered over the past few decades.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV's discovery in chronological order (Table 1) provides us with a wealth of information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections and subsequently adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung cell strain.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E experience common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort, sore throat, and 10 to 20% of patients experience fever, cough and other symptoms.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent succession in the brains of mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to HCoV-229E infections and do not differ significantly in symptoms from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide, mainly in temperate winters.
Typically, the incubation period of both viruses is less than one week, after which they develop about 2 weeks.
A study of human volunteers showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E develop edited mild common colds.
Only a few immunocompromised patients show severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first fully documented hCoV-induced pandemic in human history, and its pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third known HCoV.
The first SARS case dates back to Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002.
The SARS outbreak has resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to the super-spreader, it is estimated that each case may result in about 2 secondary cases with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load on the 10th day of the onset.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially exhibit myalgia, headache, fever, discomfort and chills, followed by late symptoms such as difficulty breathing, coughing, and respiratory distress.
Reduced lymphocytes, abnormal liver function examination and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory check abnormalities for SARS.
In addition, diffuse alve olive damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophage were observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of the patients then need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, may also be infected, often accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a source patient travelling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially found to be endemic in young children, the elderly and immune-impaired patients with respiratory diseases.
Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchostitis are common.
Another independent study showed that the same virus was isolated from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis (also known as Grubb laryngitis).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was admitted to Hospital in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma attacks.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four community-acquired HCoVs are well adapted to humans and are often less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases. But there have also been accidents and unknown reasons, such as a more toxic rare subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Typically, these HCoVs also become less toxic or pathogenic when they gain the ability to effectively spread and survive in the human body.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary transmission to close contacts.
In 2015, secondary transmission broke out again in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute renal failure, a characteristic unique to MERS in hCoV-induced diseases to date.
More than 30% of patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, with a fatality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruss known to humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, patients with concentrated pneumonia were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and a retrospective analysis confirmed a link to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared a continuing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude fatality rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the fatality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the fatality rate outside Hubei is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections characterized by fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
Diarrhea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high nucleotide sequence homologousity, they cluster to different branches in the system development tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections have been reported, which may have accelerated the rapid spread of the virus around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs, we can find interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
At this point, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and 4 community acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics that are more common in community-acquired HCoV infections, including nonspecific, mild, and even asymptomatic manifestations.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infection cases, albeit at a slightly lower rate.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern characteristics of community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as community acquired HCoV.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the spreadability of SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will decline after human transmission.
Finally, sars-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples, as with other HCoVs.
At least in some cases, whether the fecal-mouth transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays as important as in SARS-CoV remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also important to see if SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community-acquired HCoV.
However, the transmission, pathogenicity and continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 will have an important impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All 4 community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms are well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have also adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both sides may be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
The HCoV that causes severe human diseases and those suffering from severe HCoV diseases are dead.
To do this, HCoV must replicate enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations to counter host limiting factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts, the more people infected, and the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, these four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread throughout the population, causing people with normal immune function to develop the common cold.
These viruses do not require an animal host.
By contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and cannot continue to spread in humans.
They need to survive and reproduce in zoonotic hosts and may seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate hosts and expanded hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to THAT of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 community-acquired HCoVs.
It is as highly contagious as community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it can fully adapt to humans and circulate within humans without a host or intermediate animal host.
Before we discuss the animal origin of HCoV, it is of some guiding significance for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of HCoV's evolutionary host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host, and expanded host.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor that is highly homologous at the nucleotide sequence level, the animal becomes the evolutionary host of HCoV.
Ancestor viruses are usually adaptable and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the storage host carries HCoV on a continuous basis over the long term.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCoV is just parasitic to the intermediate host soon or immediately in the human body, it will not adapt well to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a source of zoonotic disease in human infections and thus act as a magnifying host by allowing the virus to replicate briefly and then spread it to humans to expand the scale of human infection.
If HCoV cannot maintain its propagation within the intermediate host, a terminal infection may occur.
In contrast, HCoV can adapt to intermediate hosts and even establish long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural storage host.
Retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that the indexed cases of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seropositive rate studies showed higher levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in animal traders against SARS-CoV than in the general population.
In the live animal market, beavers and a beaver cat were found to be carrying the SARS-CoV-like virus for the first time, almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus.
The fact that no further SARS reports have been reported after all the beavers in the market has been removed, indirectly supports this view.
However, the report says farm beavers in wild or unexposed live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the beavers may be the only ones who are only mid-amplified, rather than the natural hosts of SARS-CoV.
It is important to note that since 80% of different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that many small mammals may also act as intermediate expanded hosts of SARS-CoVs.
All of these animals appear to be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent studies of SARS-CoV natural animal hosts found a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-related chrysanthemum cobat virus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), that survives in Chinese chrysanthemum-head manta rays.
These bats were positive for the genome sequences of SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat coronaviruses are 88-92% homogenous with SARS-CoV nucleotide sequences.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
In addition, the researchers identified a variety of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but no viruses could be isolated as living viruses except for one specified WIV1.
Human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known receptor of SARS-CoV.
Experiments have shown that WIV1, extracted from bat feces samples, uses bats, beavers, and human ACE2 as receptors to enter cells.
Interestingly, serum in patients with SARS recovery is able to neutralise WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to the bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homologous.
Although the two viruses are highly homologous, WIV1 is generally considered not to be a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV, and bats are not direct storage hosts of SARS-CoV.
The system development analysis grouped MERS-CoV with bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor dipeptide peptidease 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.
MERS-CoV's RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence is system-developed closer to the corresponding RNA in bat beta-CoV from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative, bat CoV-HKU25, are only 87% homogenous in nucleotide sequences.
Therefore, bats may not be the direct storage host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-bhu llama is seropositive against MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as are camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV isolated from the nasal swab of the single-peak camel is the same as the virus found in the human body, further indicating that the camel is the true storage host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that in camels infected with MERS-CoV, the general symptoms are mild, but a large number of viruses have been observed to fall off.
It is worth noting that infected camels not only transmit the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal channel, which is also the main route by which bats transmit the virus.
However, the problem persists because many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onsidation of symptoms, which may be attributed to human-to-human or unknown transmission routes, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homologousness with bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from the medium-chrysanthemum head manta ray.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to determine the kinship.
In other words, bats may not be a direct storage host for SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
It is speculated that sars-CoV-2's intermediate animal hosts should be among the wildlife species sold and slaughtered at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, with many initial CASES OF COVID-19 associated with it, suggesting that there may have been an event of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on macrogenome sequencing have shown that an endangered small mammal called pangolin (Malay pangolin) may also carry an ancestor,beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin coronavirus genomes are 85-92% homogenous with SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences.
But they are just as closely related to RaTG13, with approximately 90% homogeneity at the nucleotide sequence level.
In the system development tree, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 virus subgens, one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and has a 97.4% amino acid sequence homologous.
By contrast, the DIFFERENCE between THE RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is greater, although the genome-wide sequences of the two are more homogenous.
An earlier study of the diseased pangolin also reported detection of overlapping groups of viruses from lung samples, with similar results associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different assembly methods and human processing to obtain a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the entire genome of a virus.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to differences in the beta-CoV sequence associated with pangolin SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly from pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV associated with pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homologousness was found in THE RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 have the highest whole-genome sequence homologousness.
It is highly deduced that the high similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is caused by selectively mediated convergence evolution.
Another counter-argument is that pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 recombine in the third wildlife species.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoV.
There is no definitive origin of direct zoonotic disease in SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the researchers also studied the origins of zoonotic diseases in HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1.
Systemic developmental evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while parent-viruses such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.
The report said the bat coronavirus, known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), found in north American tricolor bats, was shown to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus found in Ghana, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, and camels are also suspected to be their intermediate hosts.
For clarity, Figures 1 and 2 summarize existing knowledge about the animal origins of known HCoV.
Systematic developmental analysis provides evidence for historical interspecies transmission events of HCoV.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from livestock across species, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
Bat alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HCoV-229E, has been found.
In between, there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
There is multiple evidence to support the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may come into contact with bats in a common ecological niche.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bats associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca obtaining HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipa and Hendra viruses.
So it's no surprise that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Or, although bat alpha-CoV acts as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpaca and monohumpalones may be intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, as is the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good illustration of the spread from bats to single-peak camels and from single-peak camels to humanspecies.
The evolutionary origin of the bat's MERS-CoV was known in its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries reinforce this argument.
Apparently, bats provide a rich library of virus species for interspecies exchange and interspecies transmission of gene fragments.
Long-lived and dense groups, close social interactions and strong flying capabilities are all favorable conditions for bats to become ideal "virus carriers".
MerS-CoV, on the other hand, has been in the monotoma for decades.
It adapts well to these camels, which have gone from an intermediate host to a stable natural storage host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild illness in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.
It is an accident for sporadic transmission of humans, and because it cannot continue to spread, humans are still the end hosts of MERS-CoV.
The role of pangolin in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different, if any, compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the end hosts of the beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV, similar to the beavers in SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animaltology to humans must be identified or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats may be storage hosts for SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share ecological spaces with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate expanded hosts of new outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating game.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys of livestock and wildlife are necessary.
Third, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may recombine and adapt in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research continues on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to different types of animal hosts, the three main factors in viruses also play an important role in facilitating the cross-species barrier of coronaviruses.
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is estimated to be "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 per site 2 per year, depending on the phase of the coronavirus's adaptation to the new host.
The coronavirus has proofing active RNA exsotosones, and its removal can lead to very high variability and attenuation, even inability to survive.
Interestingly, Remdesivir, a known nucleoside analogue, inhibits coronavirus replication by inhibiting this ribonucleic exalciliase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Redsewe is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of the coronavirus is about 1 million times higher than that of its host.
In addition, if the coronavirus does not adapt well to the host, its mutation rate is usually high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate, indicating a higher adaptability to humans.
It can be inferred that it has adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-peak camels.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause rapid failure of vaccines and antivirals for SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genomes in the coronavirus have additional plasticity in the modification of genetic mutations and recombinations, which increases the likelihood of co-evolution among species, which, when the conditions are right, facilitates the emergence of new coronaviruses.
A large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions encoded toward the end of genomic 3' provide evidence for this.
Third, coronaviruses switch templates randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "copy selection" mechanism.
Chain exchange occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription in the host as a hybrid container.
Highly homologous full-length and sub-genome RNA can be recombined to produce new coronaviruses.
Systematic developmental evidence of natural recombination has been found in animal coronaviruses such as HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interactions related to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with host receptors is another key factor affecting interspecies transmission.
This paper, with the reorganization of SARS-CoV as a typical example, shows evidence of positive selection in interspecies propagation events.
Based on a comparative analysis of isolated strains of SARS-CoV in humans and beavers, the researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through mutations in the S protein RBD.
Typically, RBD in the coronavirus S protein interacts with cell receptors and is closely screened for host antibody responses.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318th to 510aminos of the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors to allow the virus to enter.
THE RBD OF SARS-CoV identifies ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, beavers, mice, and beaver cats, allowing the virus to spread across species.
In fact, only six different amino acid residues were observed in RBD with different amino acid residues of human and beaver virus isolates, four of which were in the receptor binding sequence that interacted with ACE2 receptors.
There are K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of beaver SARS-CoV, which may increase the affinity of the fissure protein interacting with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be critical for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S-protein S1 units is 30%, which means that the affinity of their S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a cryptoscope study showed that the affinity of this binding was 10 to 20 times higher than that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors are needed in SARS-CoV-2 propagation.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E's amino peptide seine N and HCoV-OC43's 9-O-acetylized salivary acid.
They may also explain why the coronavirus escant successfully adapted to humans after spreading across species from animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of interspecies transmission of HCoV are influenced by other host-dependent and restrictive factors.
Differences between these host proteins in humans and HCoV natural hosts such as bats, monopods and rodents may pose barriers to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must deprive the host dependency factor and break the host constraint factor in order to successfully achieve interseed propagation.
In this regard, the molecular determinants of viral-host interaction, an important area, have yet to be determined and characterized.
Unbiased, genome-wide screening of host dependencies and limits of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may yield results.
The Emergence of a New HCoV: Back to origin
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the bat coronavirus acts as a gene pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutationand and gene recombination are drivers of HCoV evolution and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes could radically change the phenotype of a virus.
In the SARS-CoV-assisted protein, BEcause of the isolation of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, but found that they can encode different ORF8 proteins, orF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide deficiencies in SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains of the virus.
This omission divides ORF88 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that facilitates host transformation.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have been recombined with alpha-and gamma-CoV lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been found in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Recombination sites were also found in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the popularity of MERS-CoV has experienced recombination events between different pedigrees, which occur in a single-peak camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were observed in other HCoVs, where HCoV and other animal coronaviruses recombined in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can lead to unexpected changes in the virus genome, most likely due to the reduction of the choice pressure applied by the host immune system facing the virus.
An example of these effects is the absence of dual nucleotides in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, which results in the absence of full-length ORF4.
Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide insertion, causing a transcoding mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the pressure of storage host selection.
After the bat is infected with the coronavirus, asymptomatic or only mild symptoms are detected, indicating that the coronavirus and bats adapt to each other.
From an anatomical and physiological point of view, bats seem to adapt well to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in bat proitis-activated reactions effectively reduce pathological changes caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity of bats is inhibited due to the positive regulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of molecular expression of the main tissue-compatible complex Class I.
Moreover, high levels of reactive oxygen (ROS) produced by high metabolic activity in bats can inhibit coronavirus replication and influence proofreading through ribnucleic acid extrosotosease, thus providing selective pressure for highly pathogenic strains to enter new hosts.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to accommodate the host.
It is no accident, therefore, that three new Types of HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
The coronavirus does not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate in large numbers and do not cause a strong host immune response.
This is why asymptomatic carriers occur and cases of severe infections occur in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storms, so the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy for dechaining the immune response may have an active effect on anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
Interferon responses are particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, it should be beneficial to use type I interferon at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, there are drawbacks to NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats.
Based on this reasoning, using MCC950 to suppress NLRP3 inflammatory bodies may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general themes on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were produced.
Although bat beta-CoV, which has been found to be 95% nucleotide homologous, is also associated with a bat coronavirus with sars-CoV-2 nucleotide homologous ness of up to 96%.
Although beavers and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoV, apparently identical to SARS-CoV-2, has been found, suggesting that pangolinmay be one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin beta-CoV may have contributed gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally manufactured.
Due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the coronavirus has regained the spotlight.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the originof HCoV zoonotic disease and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
There is substantial evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection seofs originate from human-to-fruit beaver contact on the market, closing the wet market and killing the beaver can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Similarly, in view of the discovery of multiple pedigrees of pangolin beta-CoV, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases.
But whether and how SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be studied.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been around for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to follow the chinese wildlife market's practice of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and to sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
In order to stop the recurrence of MERS outbreaks, integrated initiatives should be taken to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge, which in turn can lead to outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in the wild.
In particular, bat coronavirusd diversity with the potential for zoonotic disease is high.
These animal-like coronaviruses have many opportunities for evolution and recombination, leading to the future presence of new coronaviruses that are more likely to spread and/or become fatal in humans.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the severe tests of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, we should develop better preparedness and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have been around on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural hosts until there is an overflow opportunity.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of the virus, if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wild species, human exposure to bats and other wild species is greatly reduced.
In order to better understand the ecological condition of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary, which will prove to be useful in preventing the spread of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In summary, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic diseases is for human beings to stay away from the ecological niche of the natural host of zoonotic viruses.
There are still several missing places in the mystery of the origin of the zoonotic disease of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it makes sense to examine when bats and pangolins can share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it remains to be seen how humans will come into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection studies should be carried out.
In the case of bats, pangolins or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical pro-family viruses are expected to be found in natural hosts in the future.
Further research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which are important for the prevention and control of HUMAN COVID-19.
