B'COVID-19 is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, to help track close contact and to identify individuals ("exposed") who may be exposed to the infection.
A number of applications have been developed or introduced in some regions and jurisdictions with the support of official governments.
Many of the frameworks for the development of close contact tracking applications have been put in place.
Privacy issues also raised a number of concerns, in particular the need for some systems to track the geographical location of application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of blue doses to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that this function in support of blue teeth applications would be directly integrated into an amateur and / or operational system.
In China, the Government has jointly developed an application to support citizens to check for themselves whether they have been in contact with COVID-19.
The procedure is currently in use in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has introduced an application called TraceTous.
This application, developed locally by the IT community, will be released as an open source software and handed over to the Government. North Macedonia introduced a "StopKorona!" Application based on blue teeth to track potential patients' exposure
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Health of Northern Macedonia.
By 14 April 2020, the application was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government announced that the close contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and would be operational in the coming weeks. Ireland and France also planned to launch similar applications ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on Singapore's TraceToace application and BlueTrace agreement. Russia plans to introduce a geo-fence application for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering, University of Cambridge, cited possible practical problems in the application system, including false misrepresentation, and possible lack of effectiveness if only a small proportion of the population used the application.
To put an end to the spread of misleading or harmful "coronary virus" applications, apples limit the type of organization that can publish coronary virus-related applications in apple application shops, that is, "good."
Similar restrictions have been applied in Google and Amazon.
Privacy defenders stated that they were concerned about the use of coronary virus applications for mass surveillance and, in particular, whether the surveillance infrastructure set up to respond to the coronary virus epidemic should be dismantled after the threat of disease.
AI and more than 100 other organizations have called for such surveillance to be restricted.
These organizations have announced eight conditions to be met for government projects:
Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and surveillance expansion must have a sunset clause;
The data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes only;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there must be evidence of effective protection;
Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in accordance with the law;
Safeguards must be provided to prevent data abuse and citizens must be provided with the right to respond to data abuse;
All "relevant stakeholders" are required to "participate effectively," including public health specialists and marginalized groups. The German Mixed Computer Club (ICC) and Reporter ohne Jourzen (RSF) also published a verification list.
The proposed Google / Apple plan is intended to address ongoing surveillance issues and to remove them from the equipment operating system once tracking is no longer required.
Some countries used web-based rather than application-based location tracking, which users did not need to download, while avoiding being tracked.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
Web-based solutions with access to raw location data may have serious privacy problems.
However, not all systems with a central server have access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that communicate with one another using a central server alone have been created (see below for further details).
Korea has introduced a system that is not based on applications to carry out the contact tracking mission.
Instead of using specialized applications, the system selects to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile equipment tracking data and credit card transaction data, which can then be combined to send notifications to potential infected persons through short messaging.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government has been granted access to location information, as the information privacy law has been significantly modified following the outbreak of the MERS epidemic in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, are considering using centralized systems and privacy protection systems simultaneously.
As at 6 April 2020, no specific details had been published.
Privacy protection close contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a large number of relevant research literature dating back to 2013 at least. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups are studying privacy protection solutions, such as blue low (Ble)
PEPP-PT is a coordinated programme with a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single agreement. Decentralized agreements include decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-ppt / DP-3T), interim contact number (TCN).
Under these agreements, identifiable personal data will never leave the equipment and all matches will be made on the equipment.
The Privacy Group of the Media Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or road cross-data to track COVID.
The Platform is based on the development of a white paper entitled "Application robustness: Protecting the privacy of individuals in an outbreak," published in March 2020. In addition to this, a similar technology development company was created and committed.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to support users in sharing sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
By 5 April 2020, groups had jointly formed the Global TCN Alliance around essentially identical methods and fundamentally overlapping agreements, with the objective of reducing debris information and supporting the global interoperability of tracking and alarm applications, which was a key.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that its official government application was based on the source BlueTrace agreement.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apes, respectively, which control the Artistic and Mobile Platform, announced a close contact tracking plan, claiming that it combines blue and low-power technologies with privacy protection plus. Privacy
In addition, they have published core technical norms used in the system.
Apple and Google stated that the system was planned to be rolled out in three phases:
Introduction of tools to support the Government in creating official coronary virus tracking applications that protect privacy
In this system, Google and Apple are first rolled out through operational system upgrades, and the system will be removed in the same way after the outbreak threat, thus addressing follow-up surveillance issues.
Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is an act of cleaning the hand for the removal of dust, oil resin, microbial or other useless substances on hand.
Insisting on washing with soap at some of the "critical moments" daily can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, all of which can be transmitted through dung.
People may also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or general influenza, if they do not wash hands before they come into contact with their eyes, nose or noise (i.e. membrane).
Five key moments in a day that must be washed with soap: Pre- and post-defecation, baby-cleaning, baby-feeding, pre- and pre- or post-poultry handling.
If soap and water are not available, the wooden ash can be used to clean the hand. The World Health Organization recommends washing the hand in the following cases:
Before, during and after food preparation.
Care for patients before and after.
After the replacement of urine or cleaning of children such as toilets.
After nasal T, cough or spraying.
After touching animals, animal foods or animal faeces.
Manual hygiene of medical personnel refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand-washing before prescription or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand-washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms that may cause disease) and chemical substances on hand that may harm the human body.
Hand-washing is particularly important for those engaged in food processing or in the medical field, but it is also a very important practice for the public.
The health benefits of hand washing include minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices contributed slightly to an increase in the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory systems and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by promoting simple behavioural change (e.g. washing hands with soap).
This simple act can reduce the death rate of the above-mentioned diseases by almost 50 per cent.
The promotion of hand-washing interventions can reduce the incidence of approximately one third of diarrhoeal incidents, with the effect of providing clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap can reduce diarrhoea by 48 per cent. As a spontaneous practice in households, schools and communities around the world, hand washing with soap is the most effective and acute respiratory.
Pneumonia, as a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, killing approximately 1.8 million children every year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
UNICEF indicated that making pre- and post-toilet washing with soap ingrained habits save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention could reduce diarrhoea deaths by almost one half and acute respiratory deaths.
As part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) project, other sanitation interventions are usually undertaken while promoting hand-washing.
Hand washing can also prevent septipes transmitted through direct physical contact.
Hand washing has a minor adverse effect that frequent washing leads to dry skin, causing skin damage.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand washing led to skin tampering, fracture, known as hand-wet measles or pneumonia, which was particularly common among health-care workers.
Excessive and frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of forced disorder (OCD).
To reduce animal-oral transmission of the disease, it is necessary to wash the baby with soap at five key moments of the day: After toilet (urine, defecation), after cleaning the child's butt.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, hand washing should also be done in the right way: Before or after the cut or wound; after spraying, cough or nose aldicarb; after touching.
The rate of hand washing with soap is low in many countries / regions.
A study in 2015 on hand-washing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7 per cent of households had the lowest hand washing daily. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 per cent.
The Basic Health Care Plan introduced by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.
At the core of this national plan is the annual deworming, supported by daily hand washing with soap and tabletting with fluorine.
In Indonesia, the programme has also been successfully implemented.
The incorporation of soap or cleaning agents into water would allow for better removal of micro-organisms in the skin.
The main role of soap and cleaning agents is to reduce dissolved barriers and increase solubility.
The use of water alone cannot effectively clean skin, as fat and protein (integral parts of organic soils) are not easily soluble in water.
However, clean washing requires reasonable water...
Solid soap may remain in bacteria from previous use because it can be reused.
A small number of studies have investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap and have concluded that bacteria cannot be removed because bacteria can be washed off by foam.
However, CDC continued to claim that "it would be preferable to use non-contact liquid soap."
Antibacterial soap has been strongly promoted in a healthy mass.
To date, there is no evidence that antibiotic resistant micro-organisms in the natural environment have been selected using the recommended antibacterial or disinfection agent.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as trichlorfon, which has a large number of resistant microbial strains.
Therefore, antibacterial soap may not be as effective as propaganda, even if it is not chosen for antibiotic resistant strains.
In addition to surface active and protective agents, complex formulations may also contain acid (acetic acid, antiblood acid, emulsium acid) as a pH regulator, toxicological acid, and more skin effects.
Hot water washers are comfortable, but their calories are not sufficient to kill bacteria.
Bacteria breeds rapidly at body temperature (37 Â° C).
However, soap water is more efficient than cold soap water in the removal of natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
Scientific studies have confirmed that the use of temperate water has no effect on the reduction of micro-organisms on hand, contrary to the prevailing view.
Hand-free or decontaminated hand-washing is a non-hydraulic hand cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-hydraulic hand cleaning agents (also known as alcoholic gloves, decontaminated gloves or hand-washing) were popular.
Most of the formulations of these washing fluids contain isopropropanol or ethanol and are added to dense agents, such as Kapam polymers, for use in hydraulic fluids.
The addition of diluted hydroxide can further increase antibacterial activity. Free hand-washing fluids containing at least 60 to 95 per cent of alcohol can be effective in microbicides.
Alcohol and cellular fluids can kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (methylene pelagic wine bacteria (MRSA), hepatitis (VRE), tuberculosis
Bacterial content 70% of alcohol and cell use 30 seconds can kill 99.97% of bacteria (reduced by 3.5 quintiles similar to 35 minutes). Hand 1
Viruses (the most common cause of gastrointestinal infections) such as viruses (noroid, or Norwalk) are almost completely non-effective from alcohol or hand-hand fluids. Adequate bacterial use
Washing of hand and hand back and hand fingers and all fingers at the end of the finger will be about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or concrete changes.
The finger must also be fully cleaned and the tip washed on the two height. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the best hand washing rather than using hand-free gloves.
Due to their ease of use and the rapid loss of vitality of micro-organisms, they are increasingly being used; however, they should not be a substitute for correct hand washing unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of alcohol free of hand-washing can lead to dry skin unless wear and / or moisture are added to the formulation.
Glycerine and / or other dry agents may be added to the formulation in order to reduce or eliminate the dermal drying caused by alcohol.
In clinical trials, free hand-washing of alcohol containing wet agents can significantly reduce skin irritation and dermal drying compared to soap or bacterial cleaning agents.
Cases of allergic contact with skin, exposure and measles syndrome, or additive sensitization in alcohol or alcohol are rare.
Alcohol is less likely to induce irritating contact pneumonia than hand washing with soap and water, which is one reason for its attractiveness.
Water-free cleaning agents, while effective, do not remove organic substances from their hands, but only decontaminate them.
Thus, free hand-washing is less effective in preventing the transmission of many pathogens than soap and water, as these pathogens are still on hand.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand-washing depends to a large extent on the composition and formulation, which has historically been much less effective than alcohol and alcohol.
More recently, the formulation of the use of benzhlordecone has been proven to be persistent and cumulative antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be less effective after reuse, possibly due to skin
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use wooden ash or soil substitutes.
Wooden ash or soil is more effective than hand washing with separate water, but not as soap.
One problem is that if soil or woody ash is contaminated with micro-organisms, the spread of disease may be accelerated rather than slowed.
As with soap, grass ash is also a sterilizer, as it generates alkaline solutions when it comes to water.
Who suggested that soap could be replaced with wooden ash or sand if soap was not available.
The correct hand washing steps recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission are as follows:
Moisture with dried temperate or cooled water.
The flow of water is recommended because of the potential for contamination of staging basins, while water temperatures do not seem to be relevant.
A sufficient amount of soap is used repeatedly to wash up to produce foams while cleaning hands, fingers and fingerprints.
Soap can remove bacteria from the skin, and research has shown that people often wash hands more thoroughly when washing with soap rather than with separate water.
Rinse at least 20 seconds.
Washing can create friction, which helps remove bacteria from the skin, the longer the washing time, the more bacteria are removed.
Fully cleaned with fluid water.
Water basin washing can lead to re-contamination.
Strip or natural drying with a clean turban.
Hand moisture is more likely to be re-contaminated. Thumb, hand wire, hand-finger area and hair-seam are the most frequently neglected places.
Artificial fingerprints and fractured finger oils may hide micro-organisms.
It is generally recommended that wet milk be used to avoid manual drying; skin drying leads to damage to the skin, thus increasing the risk of transmission.
Where access to piped water and / or soap is not available in developing countries, low-cost measures are available to facilitate hand washing, for example, through a barrel or spawning water, and where necessary.
The technique of simple hydraulics is simple, with a pipe mounting a water tank and then turning a small amount of water into the hands through a fetch plate and reusing soap.
Effective handcuffing is an important step in the manual health process, but there is some debate about the most effective way of doing it in public health.
An increasing number of studies have shown that paper scarves are healthier than electric dry mobile phones provided in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, carried out a study sponsored by the European Step Research Institute (European tissue) in the headscarf industry, comparing the headscarf, warm dry and more modern.
After hand-washing, a heating dry hand drying hand was found to have increased the total number of fingerprints by 194 per cent and the number of hand-held bacteria by an average of 254 per cent.
On the other hand, the total number of hand-held bacteria increased on average by 42 per cent and the total number of hand-held bacteria increased by 15 per cent.
Hand washing leads to an average 76 per cent reduction in the total number of fingerprints and 77 per cent reduction in the total number of cervical bacteria. Scientists have also conducted tests to determine whether dry methods may.
Spray handphones are said to spray air at 180 m / s (650 km / hour; 400 miles per hour) to blow off microorganisms on hand and on the machine, which may contaminate health workers and other facilities. 2 m
The use of warm dry phones can spread micro-organisms to areas other than dry phones of 0.25 metres.
The results of the use of paper turban drives indicate that there will be no serious microbial transmission. In 2005, TÃV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess different dry methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after dry hands:
The study involved a large number of different handphone producers who compared them with those with paper scarves.
In the absence of soap and water during travel, hand washing using hand-sterile wet turban is the option.
Alcohol should be free of hand-washing at least 60 per cent of the alcohol content.
In 1846, the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis found that hand washing was effective in preventing the spread of disease in the hospital, but only after a very long period of time the medical staff was required.
The hospital uses electronic equipment that provides feedback in order to alert hospital staff when washing their hands.
One study found a decrease in infection rates as a result of the use of these devices.
Medical staff wash up at least 15 seconds and hand-washing uses sufficient soap and water or concrete to produce foam and wash all parts of the hand.
Hand-held fingers are intertwined.
If there are residues between seams, they can be removed with rigid scrap.
Since there may still be bacteria remaining on hand, they must be adequately cleaned and stripped with a clean turban.
After abrasions, the headscarves should be used to close the taps (if necessary, to open the export doors).
This prevents re-contamination of the hand as a result of exposure to these surfaces.
In health institutions, the purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic micro-organisms ("bacteria") and to avoid transmission.
Reports in the New England Medical Journal indicate that, in most medical settings, hand washing does not reach acceptable levels and that large numbers of medical personnel often forget hand washing before reaching patients, leading to microbial transmission.
One study showed that proper hand washing, together with other simple procedures, could reduce the prevalence of vascular-related infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a questionnaire that demonstrated standard hand washing and hand methods.
The organization also publishes a draft manual on manual hygiene on its website for public comment.
A related overview was made by Whitby et al.
If there is a need to verify compliance, commercial equipment can measure and validate hand hygiene.
Who recommends "five moments" of hand-washing:
After exposure to blood / body
Before and after detoxification
After taking care of the patient. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap ("soap" or "bacterial soap") can cause microbicides by hand-washing agents.
Such microbial operations may be required in an environment prior to operation or in which there is a high number of antibiotics-resistant microbial organisms. "Friction" hands for surgical purposes must be used without exposure.
All jewellery is taken.
This procedure requires washing the hand, the front arm and up to the elbow, usually for two to six minutes.
Prolonged washing is not required (10 minutes).
When washed up, water from the front arm must be prevented from flowing back to the hands.
After washing, use of sterile friction drives and wear surgical clothes.
In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, it is advisable to wash hand or use hand-free microbicides before and after exposure to the patient.
In order to control vinelosis infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from cleaning the cell comes from the 20 per cent washing frequency, with very limited further benefits when the frequency increases to more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the use of bacterial soap, the use of common soap washing leads to a threefold increase in the proportion of bacterial infections transmitted to food. The use of alcohol or hand fluids is compared
However, there are more effective interventions to reduce pistol-type H1N1 influenza (HIN1enza A) and hard-to-light bricks (Clostrip difficile).
Further research is needed on what interventions are most effective in various medical settings.
Hand washing with soap is considered to be an important cost-effective tool for achieving physical health and even good nutrition in developing countries.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes universal hand-washing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even where hand-washing stations are built at low cost, hand-washing is rare in the vicinity of every private or public health clinic.
However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be due to deep-rooted customs, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating the use of soap washing can influence policy development, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term behavioural change among the population.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based methods were effective in increasing hand-washing rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMIs), while social marketing activities were less effective. An example of clean schools
When minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star to the top three stars.
Hand-washing campaigns may include the construction of hand-washing stations to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of hand-washing activities is World Lwashing Day, which seeks to bring about behavioural change. The United Nations Children's Fund has promoted the use of a hand-washing slogans due to.
Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing and the avoidance of disability adjustment years (DALY) in developing countries.
However, reports indicate that the promotion of hand washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The earliest recognition of the importance of hand-washing to human health - in particular for those with weak health (for example, mothers who have just given birth in hospital or wounded soldiers) is the pioneer in the field of health in Austria.
At that time, most people still thought that the infection was caused by the malicious odour known as poisoning.
The outbreak of dietary diseases and medical infections in the 1980s prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to become more active in promoting cell hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The 2009 pig influenza outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand-washing with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
For example, German washing ponds in public health rooms, office buildings and airport toilets are sighted with "correct hand washing methods" posters.
The classical term "washing does not work" means that a person declares that he or she is unwilling to be responsible for or not willing to participate in a particular matter.
It derives from the Evangelical Evangelical of the Bible, and Pontius Pilate washed hands after deciding on the death of Jesus and later evolved into a wide range of English-speaking.
In Sababiya's McNee, McWhite started forced washing hands in an attempt to cleanse the premeditated spots, demonstrating her guilt in the crimes she committed and encouraging her husband to commit.
Research has shown that those who want or envisage immoral behaviour tend to wash hands more frequently than others and often value hand-washing facilities more often.
In addition, those who can wash hands when immoral behaviour is envisaged are unlikely to engage in other "purification" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religion requires hand washing for sanitary and symbolic purposes. Toilet washing, but not symbolic washing with soap, is part of many religious symbols, including Baha'i faith, Hinduism (
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing after toilets.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikh, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
Acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronary virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) has so far caused many deaths in China and other regions 80
Similar to the virus SARS-CoV - which in 2003 led to the infection of thousands of people with SARS - SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19 are lower than those of SARS, they are more widespread and affect more older persons than young people, with more men than women.
In view of the rapid increase in new pneumonia-related publications, this paper is intended to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving research topic.
We will present basic knowledge on epidemiology, pathology, viruses, diagnosis, treatment, pre-treatment and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this overview will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The spring of January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and ingrained memory of Chinese, and the outbreak of a new virus disease forced all to leave the entire holiday and several weeks thereafter.
The virus is highly homogenous to the coronary virus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named 2020 V2, 11. SARS
The epidemic began in Vukhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country, then spread to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in over 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases, of which more than 40,000 had been hospitalized and more than 3,000 had died.
Who Warning COVID-19 has become the "front-line enemy," a threat that may outweigh terrorism.
According to data published in the PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), the first report of the virus has been released from multiple patients.
The purpose of this paper is to summarize the progress of research in this emerging subject area.
It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV - Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss the knowledge gained so far with regard to the prevention and anticipation of the disease, as well as some urgent issues that remain to be addressed.
CoV has been considered a non-lethal pathogen to humans in the past, causing about 15 per cent of the general feeling.
But this century has seen two highly pathogenic categories of CoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, outbreaks in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012 respectively, rapidly spreading to many other countries with terrible.
Thus, this COVID-19 outbreak is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, Vukhan first reported a number of cases of unexplained pneumonia to the National Health Board of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoV was published.
The first case of death was reported in Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
At the same time, the epidemic rapidly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, an infection was reported among health-care personnel, suggesting that there might be an artificial phenomenon.
On 23 January, the city of Wukhan was closed and all public transport was closed.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study on new coronary pneumonia, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Vuhanhuan Seoul market, which was considered the starting point.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency."
At the time of publication of the present report, the disease had spread throughout China and close to 50 countries around the globe (figure 2 (Fig.2)).
Owing to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and magnitude of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
In February 2020, a multi-centre study for 8,866 patients (including 4,021 diagnosed COVID-19 patients) provided an update of the epidemic, as follows:
SARS-CoV-2 is available to all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 are more infected men (0.31 / 10,000) than women (0.27 / 10,000).
COVID-19 Concentrated dissemination mainly in the northern lake and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 Average time from morbidity to diagnosis 5 (2-9) days.
The average lateness period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time between morbidity and mortality is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially by 23 January 2020, in line with the time of mass population movements prior to the spring of China.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases is 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and for all patients 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large meningitis family with a single justice chain RNA.
They may be divided into four groups, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and Tex, of which al- CoV and beta-CoV are known to be infected with humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV encapsulated sugar protein (S) with its cell isotopic stress conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2) and diphetaminated 4 (P4)
Viruses RNA genome is released into cell form; after its replication, the genome RNA, together with sugar proteins and nuclear cartridge proteins, formed the virus and then merged with the organism.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV, with gene consistency exceeding 99.98 per cent of 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China Seas market in Vukhan.
In contrast to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genologically similar to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the molecular shopping of the human gas through the diameter.
The study found that the person ACE2 was the subject of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, in comparison to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S protein and human ACE2 is weaker, which corresponds to SARS-CoV-2, which causes infection less serious than SARS
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new types of short protein coded by orf3b and endocrine protein coded by Orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role and inhibit the expression of IFNBa; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional structure area or sequence.
By 18 February 2020, Zhou et al. Reported on the cryo 2.9-EM structure of the refrigerated electronic magnetometer (cryo-EM) of ACE2, the full length of the complex with ammonate.
They found that the compound had open and closed configurations and was assembled into two poles, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins to provide evidence of co-identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be the target point for screening drugs to contain SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Origin and intermediate hostels
As is well known, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate in bats and are transmitted to humanity through fruit and camels, respectively.
Through SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV system development, bats are considered to be the natural hostel of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is consistent with the two BAT-VAT BV -
However, it is not clear what middlemen help the virus become infected with human beings across the species barrier and the pathways of transmission are yet to be clarified.
JI et al. Raised the issue of smuggling from bats to people living with the virus, which involved the reorganization of congeners within S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China considered that one of the most commonly found CoV and SARS-CoRS, 99 per cent, given that it was used in mountainous - a long diet.
However, the difference of 1 per cent between the two genome remains significant; as a result, decisive results are yet to be provided with concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The rational nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 Â° C and 40-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar nature.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be thermally sensitive to ultraviolet and - 56 Â° C 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine sterilants, peroxyacetic acid
The general lack of human immunization against SARS-CoV-2 makes this new virus susceptible.
At present, there are no detailed studies on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoV, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure (Fig.4) 4).
Generally, the virus is first identified by the host's intrinsic immune system (PRR) following the invasion of the host, including C type concrete sample receptor, Toll sample receptor (TLR).
The virus is induced by inflammatory factors through different routes, tree cell maturity and the combination of type I disturbance (IFN), which can limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the penetration of the virus.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help to lift the virus out of the immune response.
Adaptive immunization promises to join the fight against the virus in the near future.
T lymphone cells, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, play an important role in anti-virus defence.
CD4 + T cell irritation B cells produce viral isomers, while CD8 + T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Auxiliary T cells produce hepatitis cell factors to help these defensive cells.
However, CoV can stifle T-cell function by inducing T-cell abatement.
Liquid immunizations, including supplementation, such as C3a and C5a - and antibody resistance, are also critical in the fight against HIV infection.
For example, antibody separation from rehabilitated patients can be mediated and MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of liberal foundations, which can cause serious damage to lung and other organs and, in the worst case, to multi-organ failure or death.
SARS-CoV-2, characterized by concentrated morbidity, is more likely to affect older persons with multiple syndrome, as well as pregnant women.
Typically, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impairments of the immune function are more likely to be infected than others.
According to a study of the earliest 425 cases in the city of Vukhan, the average latent period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average latent period of 3 days and a range of 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that, based on demographics of 8,866 cases, the probability period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective length of isolation to the most accurate latent periods so as to prevent the transmission of the virus to others by persons suffering from symptoms.
As a rule, people exposed to or infected with the virus usually need to be segregated for 14 days.
Should the length of isolation be extended to 24 days?
Heat is usually the main and first symptoms of COVID-19 and can be accompanied by no other symptoms, including dry cough, air, muscle pain, dizziness, hair, hair.
Some patients experience respiratory difficulties and / or low oxygen anaemia one week after the outbreak.
Severe people are rapidly progressing into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic fumes, metabolic acid poisoning and concrete function disorders.
Even in the absence of lung imaging anomalies, patients with hot and / or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should undergo viruses screening for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98 per cent fever, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent respiratory difficulties, 3 per cent diarrhoea and 8 per cent.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies on the incidence of family agglomeration and the incidence of molestation caused by symptoms of individual transmission.
In contrast, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients were also mainly affected by heat (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and respiratory difficulties (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of these patients require ventilation support, far more than COVID-19, in line with MERS's higher mortality rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26 per cent) and swallowed pain (21 per cent) were also observed among MeRS patients.
Among SARS patients, hot fever (99% - 100%), dry cough (29% - 75%), respiratory difficulties (40% - 42%), diarrhoea (20 - 25%) and swallowed pain
By 14 February, the global number of COVID-19 cases had reached 66,576 and the mortality rate was 2 per cent.
By comparison, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10 per cent in 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate for 2,494 confirmed cases was 37 per cent.
In an early study, SARS-CoV-2 R0 high 6.47, 95 per cent confidence zone (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2.
Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a proliferation capacity higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter.
Control of SARS-CoV-2 is therefore more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Concentrated morbidity usually occurs in the same household or from the same gathering or means of transport, such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have travel or residence history in Vukhan or other epidemiological areas, or close contact with infected persons or patients, within the last two weeks prior to their illness.
However, it was reported that people could carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and that cured patients who were out of hospital could again bear the virus, thereby alerting them to prolonged periods of isolation.
The number of blood cells (especially lymphoid cells) is normal or decreasing in the early days of the disease.
For example, white cell count & LT was found among 1,099 COVID-19 patients; 4 x109 / L - including lymphocylene cell count & LT; 1 x109 / L reduction.
Increases in liver and muscles in blood and muscle protein levels are observed in some patients, most of them with higher blood C reactive protein and blood deposition.
High blood fibre protein degradation products are observed in heavy patients with higher D-II polymers and a decrease in lymphic cell count.
The majority of COVID-19 patients are exposed to anomaly in the chest, characterized by two-sided films or lung glass.
Patients usually experience atypical pneumonia, acute pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammatory conditions, liquid accumulation and sexual fibration can seriously impair the exchange of gases.
Skin cell function disorders in type I and type II lung bubbles reduce surface activity levels and increase surface weight, thus reducing lung expansion capacity and increasing the risk of lung landslides.
As a result, the worst chest imagery usually coincides with the greatest severity of the disease.
By 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 found pneumatic cell decontamination in the lung of a patient who died of the disease, transparent membrane formation, mesosal
Test SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the RCC Reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19.
However, since a higher probation rate is likely to accelerate the epidemic, China began diagnosing clinical performance on 13 February 2020 (instead of relying solely on RT-PCR).
A similar situation occurred during the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical performance, laboratory examinations and photographic results is essential for effective diagnosis.
By 14 February 2020, the top team had reported a programme using Sherlock technology based on CRISPR, 10 SARS-CoV-2, which did not require complex instruments and used a test paper for less than one hour.
If validated in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of diagnosis.
Due to the lack of experience in treating the new type of CoV, doctors mainly support COVID-19 patients while attempting to use or propose other CoV - e.g. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV - and others
These treatments include current and potential treatment methods such as antiretrovirals, immunosuppressors, opioids, plasma, poisoning and psychological support for rehabilitated patients.
It is even recommended that the plasma of the rehabilitated patient be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibiotics and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacked primarily the lung and, to a lesser extent, other organs of ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidney.
Nevertheless, respiratory disorders and failure are the main threats to patients and the leading cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential for mitigating symptoms and saving lives, including conventional oxygen adsorption, high flow oxygen, non-ventilation and creative ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive support from the ECMO, an improved cardiovascular bypass technique to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and sepsis and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is well known that the disproportionate response of the immune systems of SARS and MERS patients leads to cell-induced storms.
IFS-cell storms are a form of pneumatic reactions characterized by a range of cell factors, including TNFpha, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNpha, IFNCP.
These cell factors can induce immune cells to release large amounts of free base, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppressing is crucial in the treatment of cell storms, especially among severely ill patients.
Leather-cool and pearl monograph - a resistant IL6 monograph - have been used to treat cell storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cell storms include: Regulation T cell targeted immune response; interruptions IFN-gamma, IL-1 and TNF; depression Jak; Bombasal resistance;
Ethanol is widely used as an immunosuppressor to treat SARS in order to mitigate the severity of the damage caused by inflammatory conditions.
However, large doses of solid anol do not contribute to severe lung damage among SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can have serious side effects, particularly haemorrhagic fractures, which seriously affect the anticipation.
Nevertheless, short-range treatment of high-risk diseases COVID-19 patients with low and medium doses of dermal solid anol is recommended.
At the time of writing, the existence of effective ART had not been confirmed.
However, it has been found that Ridseau - a nucleotide analogy - intravenous drugs are effective against a CVID-19 patient in the United States.
Redsey, a new antivirus drug developed in Gilide, was initially used to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
It was later proved that Ridsewe could contain other single chains of RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gilide has made the drug available to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, the results of which are expected.
In addition, potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms have been recommended in Bareksnie, alpha-disturbance, Losenabe / Litonavibe and Libevin.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur as a result of co-treatment in Lopenawe / LitonowÃ©.
The interaction between these treatment methods and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibiotics of rehabilitated patients
It is a long history for patients recovering from infectious diseases to collect blood for the treatment of other patients with the same diseases or to protect healthy individuals from the disease.
In practice, rehabilitated patients usually contain relatively high levels of resistance to pathogens in their blood.
Antiquities are an immune protein (IG) generated by B lymphic cells to counter pathogens and other isomers, which identify and directly confront unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this rationale, blood plasma was collected from a group of rehabilitated COVID-19 patients and then injected into 10 high-risk patients.
Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours, while pneumonia and viruses were found to have decreased and oxygen saturation had increased.
However, before special heterosexual therapy is developed, there is a need for validation and clarification to suggest methods that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, given the effects of treatment, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, resistance can excessively stimulate immune reactions and cause cell factors to release syndrome, a toxic response that can endanger life.
Antibody concentrations in blood are generally low, while plasma demand for treatment of high-risk patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce heterogeneity resistance sufficiently quickly to confront a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more critical and practical to remove B cells from the body of the rehabilitated patient and to identify genetic passwords for effective antibody coding, or to screen effective antitics against the protein necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibiotics.
In China, TCM has been used to treat multiple diseases for thousands of years.
However, the effectiveness of their treatment depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple components in the prescription, which differs in the diagnosis of diseases based on the TCM theory.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and validate such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and heterogeneous treatments for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from severe.
For example, it has been found that optical detoxification caps and incineration pest caps are effective for COVID-19 treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87 per cent of patients use TCM treatment, with the highest treatment rates observed for COVID-19 patients, including sugar (63.7 per cent), ningia (50 per cent) and Lakes
However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other influences, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Zhang Due and his colleagues published a study on the comparison of Western drugs (WM) for individual treatments with WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for WM + TCM group temperature restoration, symptoms disappearance and hospitalization was significantly shorter than the pure WM group.
The most impressive is that the symptoms of the WM + TCM group (from light to heavy) are significantly lower than pure WM (7.4 per cent versus 46.2 per cent) and WM is equally lower.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of TCM still need to be confirmed by better quality exposure tests, greater scope and more centres.
Recognition of the role mechanisms of TCM treatment or its combinations and, where possible, articulation of their effective components will also be of concern.
Most of those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 are extremely frightened by this highly contagious and even lethal disease, as well as isolation, isolation and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, oxygen deficiency and cough, as well as poor responses to treatment, such as sleep caused by pyrozol, can increase anxiety.
A range of psychological responses were reported in the early stages of the outbreak of SARS, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic behaviour, mental activism, psychiatric symptoms, adventurism and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19, mandatory close contact tracking and segregation increases anxiety and guilt with regard to the effects of transmission, isolation and stigmatization on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams to avoid close contact through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, using specialized electronic equipment and applications.
Effective vaccines are critical to interrupting the transmission chain from animal hostels and infected persons to vulnerable ones and are often used as a complement to anti-virus treatment in controlling emerging virus-induced epidemics.
Industry has made efforts to develop a S-protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and effective intermediate and antibody and / or protective immunization against SARS-CoV.
The detoxification vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.
However, prior to the initiation of clinical research, the internal effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in old age and lethal assault models, as well as their role in protecting human and animal co-infection with the virus, had not been determined.
This is probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
By contrast, sporadic cases and concentrated infections persist in the Middle East region and spread to other regions due to the persistence of a common source of human and animal disease in the affected areas.
Vaccination strategies against MERS, some of which have been evaluated in animal models, have been developed through the use of living viruses, DNA particles, virus carriers, nanopes, virgin particles and the restructuring of protein.
The development of safe and effective vaccines for non-immunized individuals, targeting SARS-CoV-2, is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging owing to the long time required for vaccine development (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in CoV.
As a new type of disease, COVID-19 has just begun to demonstrate its complete clinical process among thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can be gradually rehabilitated with no sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has high morbidity and mortality rates.
Therefore, the establishment of pre-treatment models for the disease is essential for health-care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be prematurely related to COVID-19 patients (Table33):
Age: Age is the most important factor affecting the advance of SARS, as is COVID-19.
As noted earlier, COVID-19 was mainly found in the 30-65 age group in a study that included 8,866 cases, of which 47.7 per cent were over 50 years of age.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have basic syndrome and complications and are significantly older than those who do not need it (median age 66 to 51), indicating a predicted age of COVID-19.
Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men than women are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31 / 10,000 to 0.27 / 10,000).
Syndrome and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart damage and heart disorders.
Heart incidents are also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be combined with ACE2 positive fibre cell, which could lead to liver malfunctions among COVID-19 patients.
It is noteworthy that age is closely related to, and may affect, underlying diseases.
Laboratory results are abnormal: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammatory or organizational impairment and is considered a potential predictor of disease, treatment response and eventual recovery.
It was also suggested that CRP levels were relevant to the severity of COVID-19 and the predetermined existence.
In addition, elevated mammoxate (LDH), winter ammonia transfer enzymes (AST), AST (ALT) and muscle acid laser (ck) may also help predict.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
As a result, they are traditional signs of heart or liver function disorders.
Main clinical symptoms: The timing of chest imaging examinations and clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict the occurrence and complications of COVID-19.
Use of stomethanol: As previously mentioned, it is an immune inhibitor and is usually used as a supplementary treatment for infectious diseases in order to mitigate the severity of the damage caused by inflammatory diseases.
As large doses of dermatol are widely used in heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from ischaemic bones, leading to lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if needed, pyrocline should be used in the case of COVID-19 patients with small doses and short periods of time.
Psychological stress: As noted earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under great stress because they were often subjected to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of relatives and friends.
Psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients escape stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from those of SARS.
In addition to reproduction in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated effectively in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or symptoms at an early stage of infection, similar to V Co.
As a result, the infection generates a large number of viruses in the course of day-to-day activities at an early or latent stage of the disease, which makes it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV is considered to occur at a time when the patient is seriously ill and most of it does not occur at an early stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more serious and difficult to control than in SARS.
China is currently making great efforts, including the blockade of Wukhan and surrounding cities, as well as the continued isolation of almost all the population, with a view to interrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have caused serious damage to China's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the pace of the epidemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and that the decline phase will last 3-4 months.
However, other experts were less optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. Estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more infectious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
IRA Longini et al. Have developed models to predict the consequences of the epidemic, arguing that SARS-CoV-2 may be infected with two thirds of the global population.
A Canadian team reported that patients who had been rehabilitated and discharged two weeks ago had been detected in their nose and swallowed, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.
However, with the decrease in the number of new cases, China has shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.
Ebola was predicted to cause 100,000 cases and 50,000 deaths.
However, through strict segregation, the disease is eventually controlled.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases may weaken and eventually disappear or become less pathogenic viruses living with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and can be transmitted by cough or spraying, even through direct exposure to articles contaminated with the virus.
The virus is also found in the faeces, increasing the likelihood of its spread.
A recent study, which included 138 cases, indicated that 41 per cent of cases could have been caused by indoor infections, including 17 patients previously suffering from other diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, more intensive preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health-care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have been in contact with the patient or the infected.
The first line of protection that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks; the use of surgical and N95 dust masks (1860s series) contributes to controlling transmission of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent liquid drip from potential infected persons from spreading in air or being clouded to the surface of articles that may be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks prevent inhalation of viruses ranging from 10 to 80 NM, with only 5% of the viruses fully penetrating; SARS-SAV-2.
Since the virus particles can even penetrate five overlapping surgical masks, health-care personnel in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear separate clothing in order to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted from the eyes.
By 22 January 2020, a doctor had contracted SARS-CoV-2 while wearing N95 masks; the virus could have entered its body through a hepatitis eye.
Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or glasses when facing patients.
For the general public in areas affected by or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people use sterilized soap washers more frequently than at normal times, keep themselves as isolated as possible and limit contact with potential.
Three feet is considered to be the right distance from the patient.
These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, on the basis of deep memories of the 2003 outbreak of SARS, it was reported on 7 January 2020 that it was a high alert to SARS.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the Director of the Vukhan Disease Prevention and Control Centre continued to reassure the population that the new virus was less infectious, had limited human potential and that the epidemic was preventable.
The news clearly lowered public vigilance and, at the dawn of the spring, missed key nodes of containment of the epidemic in Vukhan.
China's disease control agencies are likely to learn from this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more cautious when issuing pronouncements, since each word is critical to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) seek to be more sensitive and responsive to outbreaks from hospitals.
COVID-19, caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 appears like SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
More older persons than young people are affected by COVID-19, more men than women, and the severity and mortality of older persons is higher than that of young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
Even in the absence of symptoms, COVID-19 transmits the virus, while SARS usually transmits the virus when the condition is serious, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Among some COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 regular RNA results may be negative.
On the other hand, cured patients may return to the sun again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Considering that the study on COVID-19 is so fast, the following key issues remain to be addressed:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Although 96 per cent of genotoxicity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the bats SARS sample CoV, we are unable to reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal is the transmission of the virus from the original hostel - assumed bats - to the middleman of humanity?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off the means of transmission and there is a risk that outbreaks may recur at any time.
Although molecular models and bio-chemical analyses have proved that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how can the virus accurately enter turbine cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with the cell of ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically advance in the course of human transmissions?
Would it become a global pandemic? Would it disappear like SARS? Would it revert to it on a regular basis, as in the case of influenza?
It is important to find answers to many of these and other questions, but it may take longer.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore normalcy to our lives.
B A COVID-19 Vaccines refer to a hypothetical vaccine against 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
Despite the absence of a vaccine to complete clinical trials, various attempts to develop such a vaccine are still under way.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that no vaccine against the virus was expected within 18 months.
In April, five candidate vaccines entered the I safety study.
COVID-19 was found in December 2019.
By 2020, a massive epidemic had spread globally, triggering significant investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are developing a possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using the published virus genome.
CEPI presented its vaccine development plan in April and stated that the immediate priorities were speed, production capacity, mass deployment and global accessibility.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technical platforms were studying and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.
The main platform targets for entry I safety studies include:
Perfluorooctane sulfonate (DNA and RNA) (I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus carrier (I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, 5 thyroid carrier)
CEPI scientists reported in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in the early stages of development, of which 78 were identified as ongoing projects (79 according to data from the Mirkenko Institute) and 37 were almost announced.
The I-II test carries out initial safety and immunoprophylaxis tests, usually at multiple points of random and comfort control, together with the identification of more precise and effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines for disease prevention, while monitoring adverse reactions at the best dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (confirmed up to the beginning of April 2020), 74 have yet to undergo a human evaluation (still in "pre-clinical" studies).

Some vaccines have heterogenic effects, also known as non-heterogeneous effects.
This means that, in addition to disease prevention, they can bring other benefits.
Further random tests in Australia are in the process of recruiting 4,170 health-care personnel.
Vaccines under development may be unsafe or ineffective.
The use of COVID-19 heterosexual animal models, such as ACE2 genetically modified rats, other experimental animals and non-human elegates, to assess vaccine efficacy and conduct early research to ensure biosafety
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there are no safe and effective SARS treatments or preventive vaccines for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for SARS treatment is a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world. Moreover, there is currently no effective vaccine against MERS.
At the time of the prevalence of MERS, it was felt that the existing SARS research could provide useful templates for the development of vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has been completed, and three other vaccines are under development, all of which are VV-1, ChRS (two of them).
Various social media articles had fuelled the plot, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 had been found and that vaccines were available.
Patents cited in various social media articles refer to other existing coronary viruses (such as SARS coronies), gene sequences and patents of vaccines.
Cardiovascular stress conversion enzymes 2 (Angiotensin-tating Enzyme 2, ACE2) is attached to lung, stomach, heart, kidney and intestinal.
ACE2 Reduce relevant vascular stress conversion enzymes (Angiotensin-talting Enzyme) by reducing cardiovascular stress II levels and increasing Ang (1-7). ACE
The human source version of the enzyme is commonly referred to as hACE2.
Cardiovascular stress conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc metal enzyme in the inner cell and other cell surfaces.
ACE2 protein consists of a N-end pentachlorophenol M2 structural area and a C-bottom collection trin kidney ammonium acid transporting protein structure.
ACE2 is a single-molecular protein whose enzyme structure is exposed to the cell surfaces of lung and other tissues.
Another enzyme known as sheddase separates the outer cell structure of ACE2 from the terra-musical structure, releasing soluble protein into blood and eventually excreting into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes, mainly lung II lung bubble cells, intestinal dermal cells, most organ pulses and intravenous cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression has also been found in brain skin, fingerprint, undercover and brain.
The main function of ACE2 is the checks and balances of ACE.
ACE decontaminated vascular stress I into cardiovascular stress II with a cardiovascular compression.
ACE2 follow-up vascular tension II (ASP-ARG-Val-Ile-p-Pro-Phe) with cardiovascular hydraulic hydraulate;
ACE2 can also break down many other penta, including decontaminated ammonia 9 passivation, apelin, neurodepressants, strong morphall A and stomach.
ACE2 can also regulate the meningage transport of median ammonia acid transporting protein SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup.
As a cross-membrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for some coronary viruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (leading to SARS virus); and SARS-Co2
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 S1 irritated protein are integrated with the enzyme structural area of ACE2 on the cell surface, leading to internal assimilation, and
This process of entry, which also requires hostel silamine protein TMPRSS2 activation of S protein, is currently being studied as a potential treatment. Some speculate that a reduction of ACE2 in cells.
However, several professional associations and regulators have recommended the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis, published on 11 July 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia for those at higher risk of pneumonia, especially for jails and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in mortality associated with pneumonia, but the results are less reliable than the overall risk of pneumonia. "
Reconstitution ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new method of treating acute lung damage, which seems to improve the pneumatic mobility indicators and blood saturation in pigs due to acute respiration.
RhACE2 has a half-life of about 10 hours in humans, 30 minutes in effect and 24 hours in the course of action (duration).
Some studies show that acute kidney-vascular stress systems (renin-angiotensin systems, RAS) inhibitors are highly resistant patients or circulatory vascular stress II advanced drugs.
The 2011-2020 coronary virus epidemic is a continuing epidemic of 2019 new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19), triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The current outbreak in Vukhan, China, in December 2019 confirmed that 1 January 2020 was recognized as a public health emergency of international concern and 11 March 2020 as an epidemic.
By 10 April 2020, an estimated 161,000 COVID-19 cases and 97,000 deaths had been reported in 210 countries and territories globally,
Treatment amounted to 364,000 people.
The mortality rate in China is about 4 per cent, while in all regions of the globe it is between 0.08 per cent (New Zealand) and 13.04 per cent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and haste.
It may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The probability period from exposure to morbidity ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.
There is no vaccine or specific anti-virus treatment programme.
Clinical treatment focuses on symptomatic support treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, cough shopping, safe distance from others, surveillance of suspected infections and self-segregation.
Official State agencies have responded with regard to travel restrictions, isolation, curfews, hazardous workplace controls and facility closures.
The epidemic has had a severe impact on the global socio-economic situation, with the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, exacerbated by panic shopping.
Global 193 countries and territories have national or local discontinuation measures, affecting some 99.4 per cent of primary and secondary school students.
There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian descent and appearance groups and groups in regions with severe epidemics as a result of the spread of false virus information online.
However, reduced travel and heavy industrial closures have reduced air pollution indices and reduced carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health sector in Vukhan, Province of Hubei, China, reported an unexplained case of pneumonia and launched a survey in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the wholesale market in the South China Sea and, as a result, new coronary viruses are considered to be common to humans and animals.
The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to bats' coronary virus, mountainous coronary virus and SARS-CoV. 2012
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were confirmed to be linked to the South China Seat market.
An unconfirmed increase in the number of cases reported outside of the Republic of Korea on 13 March 2020 was reported by the Republic of Korea. The first case may be traced back to November 2019, with 55-year-old males.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially minor cases.
By 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among adolescents, with only 2.4 per cent globally aged 19 and under. The British Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Wallens, estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the population needed effective immunization.
The number of cases refers to the number of persons tested by COVID-19 and confirmed positive under official programmes.
As of 23 March, no more than 3 per cent of the total population had been tested worldwide, and many countries had issued official policies for people not to be tested for minor diseases, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March indicated that, as of 23 January, 86 per cent of the estimated COVID-19 infections in China had not been tested and that 79 per cent of recorded cases were recorded.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the actual number of infections in Italy was far higher than the number of reported cases.
The basic transmission (R0) of COVID-19 was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is likely to be 5.7 R0.
Most COVID-19 patients can be rehabilitated.
The period between morbidity and death of insolvent patients is 6-41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As at 10 April 2020, some 970,000 people had died from COVID-19.
As of 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths in China were among those over 60 years of age and 75 per cent were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official statistics refer to new cases.
Actual COVID-19 deaths may well exceed statistics, as they may not include undetected patients, such as those who die at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times higher than the number of deaths from neoponous pneumonia in official statistics.
A female spokesman for the CDC in China spoke: "We know that [the number of deaths published] is below the actual figure," and anecdotal stories about the underestimation of United States data attest.
The first case of death outside China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February and the first case outside Asia in France on 14 February.
As at 28 February, there were more than a dozen deaths outside China, in Iran, the Republic of Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than 40 deaths had been reported in all continents except Antarctica. Several methods were often used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region and vary over time and are influenced by detection levels, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the first outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status. Incidence of death
According to statistics from John Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as at 10 April 2020 was 6.0 per cent (97,039 / 1,617,204).
Morbidity and mortality rates vary from region to region.
In China, the estimates of the disease mortality rate decreased from 17.3 per cent (the number of confirmed deaths between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (the number of deaths diagnosed) (the number of deaths after 2 months). Measures
These statistics are time-bound and track the entire process from infection to case resolution for specific populations.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these data for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-based Medicine estimates the overall rate of infection mortality in the epidemic to be between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The range estimate ceiling is consistent with the first random test conducted by Germany for COVID-19 and a statistical analysis study of the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims that the epidemic is manageable.
Peak outbreaks and final duration are uncertain and vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni from the State University of Bong states: "If not controlled, outbreaks of infectious diseases tend to stagnate after the depletion of existing dormitories and then begin to slow down.
But it is almost impossible at this time to reasonably predict when the abduction will occur. "
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Chonanama, believes that an end to the epidemic in June can be expected if all countries mobilize and adopt the recommendations of the World Health Organization to take measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "could be repeated for a period of one to two years."
Neil Ferguson, a study led by the Empire Institute of Technology, states that "physical distance and other measures are essential before vaccines can be used (possibly 18 months or longer)."
William Schaffner from the University of Vanderburg stated: "The coronary virus is very widespread and I do not think it is likely to disappear completely" and "may evolve into a seasonal disease that breaks."
The severity of the re-outbreak depends on the immune power of the group and the level of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-heterogeneous and some of the infected may have no symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory fluids (blood), sniper loss, stick, muscle and shock pains, head pain, cold, vomiting, diarrhoea
The CDC classifies respiratory distress, continuous chest pain or stress, sudden perception blurred, hard awakening and face or mouth lips as acute symptoms; if they occur, they are recommended for immediate medical.
Some infected persons may have no symptoms and no clinical symptoms, but the results are positive, and researchers therefore recommend close observation and examination of close contact with diagnosed patients to exclude the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the rate of invalids varies from very low to 44 per cent.
Latent periods (time interval from infection to morbidity) are generally between 1 and 14 days; 5 days are the most common. Uncertainty can be illustrated by an example: COVID-19 patients were estimated to have lost 30 per cent.
Some details of the pathway have not yet been determined.
It is considered that the disease is transmitted mainly through close contact and foam from cough, spraying or talking; close exposure refers to intermittent 1-2 metres (3-6 feet).
The study found that cough failure could result in the most distant transmission of foam 4.5 m (15 feet) -8.2 m (15-27 feet).
It was also suggested that the long time spent in air by the foam generated at the time of the statement could also lead to the transmission of the virus. Although the virus is usually not transmitted by air, people may also produce bubbles.
This foam may fall into the environs' nose and may even be inhaled into the lung.
Medical procedures such as injection and cardiovascular recovery (CPR) may aerosol respiratory endocrine, leading to air transmission.
In addition, if a person touches the surface of the virus, including skin, before touching his or her eyes and nose, it may also lead to the transmission of the virus.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through excreta, but this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese Government denies the possibility of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 excreta. The virus is the most contagious in the first three days of the disease, but also contagious before and after it.
Positive results can be detected at the earliest three days before the onset of the disease, indicating that the new coronary virus is already contagious prior to a clear symptoms.
Despite the low number of reported cases of symptoms diagnosed by laboratories, a number of countries have found symptomatic infections in the course of contact-tracking surveys.
The European Centre for Surveillance and Control (ECDC) indicated that although the transmission power of the neo-coronary virus is not yet fully clear, general 1 people will be infected between 2 and 3 people. The virus
Specifically, new coronies are known to survive for up to three days on plastics (polypropene) and 304 less steel, one day on paper and four hours on copper.
However, their lifetime is also affected by humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals COVID-19 have been tested positive.
There is currently no evidence that animals will re-transmit the virus to humans, but official British agencies have advised people to wash their hands after exposure to animals, just as they are exposed to the surfaces of other potentially infected persons.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, first separated from three pneumonia patients from a group of acute respiratory diseases in Vukhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the relevant coronary virus in the natural world. The virus can be eliminated with domestic soap, since RS is able to dissipate the virus.
It is now considered to be a co-disease in humans and animals.
Genetic analysis shows that this coronary virus is genetically associated with the beta-coronary virus in Sarbeco and submarine (B-B) and two bat-source groups of virus strains.
New coronies are consistent with other bats' coronary virus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at a level of 96 per cent of the whole genome.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that in some parts of the genome sequence there was a difference between the virus in mountains and the virus in human body, only one ammonium acid.
A comparison of the entire genome to date found that a maximum of 92 per cent of the genetic material between the mountain coronary virus and SARS-CoV-2 was not sufficient to prove that the dress was an intermediate.
The virus can be initially diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but ultimately only through the RRT-PCR (RRT-PCR) or CT imagery of the infected endocrine.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan shows that CT is clearly more sensitive than PCR, but is less heterogeneous and that many imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the American Radiation Society recommended that "CT is not suitable for screening COVID-19 or as a first test for diagnosing the disease."
The World Health Organization has now published several programmes for the detection of nuclear acidification in SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was launched on 17 January.
Nuclear acid testing uses real-time reverse polymers chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
Respiratory or blood samples can be used for testing.
The results are generally available within a few hours and days.
In general, this testing is done either by nose or by swallowed. Many laboratories and companies are developing seropositive tests for the detection of antibody resistance.
As at 6 April 2020, none of these tests had proved sufficiently accurate to allow widespread use.
In the United States, seropositive experiments developed by Cellex have been approved for use in emergency situations only in a validation laboratory.
Typical imaging features of X and computer stratifier scanning (CT) for the sick include the asymmetry of grinding glass and the absence of chest stomach.
The Italian Radiology Institute is compiling an international online database on the image performance of confirmed cases.
There is limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19 for images that are not confirmed by PCR due to their re-association with other viruses, such as breast virus.
A large Chinese study comparing chest CT results with PCR results found that although images were less specific to the detection of infection, detection was faster and more sensitive and could therefore be considered as a means of screening for endemic areas.
A molecular neurological network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to jointly use X and CT to test the images of the virus.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good hygiene practices, hand washing, avoidance of unwashing to touch directly the nose of the eye, cough or jet with paper scarves, and direct loss of paper scarves
Persons suspected of being infected should wear medical surgical masks when they enter public places.
Measures to maintain physical distance are also recommended to prevent transmission of the virus. Many Governments have restricted or recommended that travel to and from countries and regions affected by the epidemic be avoided when unnecessary.
However, the virus has now reached a community transmission stage in most parts of the globe.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community and that some community residents are not aware of where or how they are infected. Health care providers who come into contact with suspected infections should take standard precautions, exposure prophylaxis and exposure
The use of mobile phone positioning data by the Government for tracking purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations, such as Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for such monitoring to be restricted.
Various mobile applications have been put into use or entered into proposals for voluntary use, and by 7 April 2020, over 10 expert groups were working on solutions with privacy protection functions, such as the distance between users of blue dental records and other mobile phones.
Once in close contact with COVID-19 patients tested positive, the user receives a reminder of the information. Misinformation about prevention of infection continues to spread; such as washing nose and washing is ineffective.
There are currently no COVID-19 vaccines, but many organizations are actively developing them.
It is recommended that the spread of disease be prevented by hand washing.
CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and running water up to 20 seconds, especially after toilets or visible sludge on hand, before meals, and after inhaling nose, cough.
This is because, before entering the human body, the virus can destroy its protective blast by using household soap only, thereby contributing to its extinction.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-containing hand-washing fluids with at least 60 per cent alcohol if there is no soap or running water.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without hand washing.
The object surface can be sterilized with multiple solvents (sterile fluids can become effective within one minute of the less steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1
Other solutions (such as benzaline and chlor-alkali) are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if new coronary virus suspected cases or confirmed cases occur in facilities such as offices or day-care facilities, all areas should be decontaminated, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, common equipment
Who recommended that people wear their slogans or paper towels in cough or spraying and immediately dispose of all contaminated towels.
Persons suspected to be infected are advised to wear medical surgical masks, as wearing masks reduces the amount of foam called when speaking, spraying and cough and reduces the distance of transmission.
The World Health Organization has issued a note on the conditions and methods of use of masks.
The Virturer Stephen Griffin of the University of Lyz believes that "masks can reduce the tendency of people to find themselves, which is also a major source of infection in the absence of toilet."
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that healthy populations should wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for COVID-19 patients, although the organization also recognized that mask wearing helped to avoid.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical masks made with plastics. China explicitly recommends that healthy citizens also wear one-time medical masks, especially in the range of 1 m (3 feet).
Hong Kong, China, proposes to wear masks when using public transport or entering crowd densely populated areas.
Thai health officials advised people to mask themselves and cleanse them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are forbidden from wearing masks or from hitting nose into public places.
On 16 March, Viet Nam asked all people to wear masks in order to enter public places in order to protect themselves and others.
According to the Government of Austria, all persons are required to wear masks when entering miscellaneous stores.
Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million hooden days since mid-March, and 1 April has begun to require masks to be mounted in train and inter-city buses.
Panama made it mandatory to wear masks and advised that the masks could not be purchased from the residents themselves.
The cover has also been widely used in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infection prevention and control measures relating to social distance (also known as physical distance) are aimed at minimizing close human contact and thus reducing the spread of disease.
Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension from school, shutdown of work and closure of stadium, theatres or shopping centres.
Measures that individuals can take to maintain social distance include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas, switching to non-contact interrogation methods and maintaining physical distance to others.
Many Governments have now made it mandatory or recommended that social distances be maintained in areas affected by the epidemic.
With regard to the size of the largest crowd, United States Government agencies and WHO initially recommended 250 people (in areas not covered by COVID-19), which was quickly reduced to 50 and later to 10.
In March 2020, Germany banned more than two people from public gatherings. "It was recommended that the elderly and those with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and impairment of the immune system should replace."
The use of the term "social distance" has the implication of requiring people to be completely isolated from society and does not encourage other ways of maintaining human connections. Some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines applicable during the pandemic.
Recommendations included sexual intercourse only with partners living with and without viruses or symptoms.
Recommendation COVID-19 Identify people living with and suspected to be infected in their homes for self-segregation.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on correct self-segregation. Many Governments have imposed or recommended self-segregation on the entire population of the affected areas.
The most severe self-segregation instructions were also issued to high-risk populations.
If it is possible to have access to COVID-19 patients, or to countries or areas where widespread transmission has occurred in the near future, it is recommended that they be separated from the last possible exposure of the virus for 14 days.
Epidemic prevention strategies include containment / containment and mitigation.
Containment applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolating infected persons, along with other measures of infection control and vaccination, to stop the spread of the disease to other populations.
If the spread of the disease is not contained, efforts should be made to move to a mitigation phase: Measures to slow the spread of the disease and to reduce its impact on health systems and society.
Containment and mitigation measures can go hand in hand.
Containment requires even more extreme preventive measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic regeneration to less than 1 per cent. Part of the effort to control outbreaks of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which we know.
This would reduce the risk of the collapse of the health service system and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programmes.
Non-drug interventions to control the epidemic include individual preventive measures, such as handcuffing, masks and self-isolation; community-based measures aimed at maintaining physical distances, such as suspension and elimination of mass gatherings; and
Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Republic of Korea has introduced large-scale screening and localized isolation measures and has issued alerts on the activity trajectory of infected persons.
Singapore provides financial support for self-segregated infections and imposes a significant fine on those who refuse to separate themselves.
Taiwan, China, increased mask production and imposed penalties on suppliers of medical goods that were sold at best. Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States showed significant challenges in mitigating (but not halting the spread of the epidemic).
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak health needs by two thirds, halving deaths, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the breakdown of health systems.
Containment may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus ceases to spread among the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever is the case), or if the measure is relaxed.
Long-term interventions aimed at curbing the pandemic have social and economic costs.
No specific antiretrovirals have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.
The use of non-prescription impressions, rehydration and rest may help to alleviate symptoms.
Oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required depending on the severity of the disease.
The use of opioid is likely to worsen the situation.
Several compounds previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being studied to determine their applicability to the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also noted that some "traditional and family therapy" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
According to the World Health Organization, improving treatment capacity and adapting health systems to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients are essential epidemiological responses.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including concentration of laboratory services in COVID-19 testing, elimination of selective procedures, segregation and segregation.
Speculation on the origin of the first case (that is, the so-called Zero patients) is mixed.
The first known case of new coronary virus pneumonia may be traced back to 1 December 2019, located in Wukhan, North Lake China.
Within one month, there has been a gradual increase in new coronary virus cases in Hubei Province.

The central bank responded faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public places such as tourist destinations and the recommendation of Governments to avoid the impact of travel.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights as a result of declining demand, including British Airlines, China Oriental Airlines and Australian Airlines, while British Airlines Flybe has unfortunately collapsed.
The cruise ship industry has been hit more heavily than ever before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been forced to close.
The epidemic coincided with the spring season, which was an important tourism season because of China's Spring holiday.
The national and local governments have eliminated a range of activities involving crowd mobilization, including the annual spring, and private enterprises have closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong Didiennius and Shanghai Dini.
Many New Year of Agriculture events and tourist sites, including the Beijing Palace and the Temple of Temple, have been abolished and closed to prevent large-scale population mobilization.
In China, 24 out of 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions extended the new annual leave to 2 months and 10 days, requiring most enterprises not to resume work before that date.
These regions account for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong, China, raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, suspended schools for three months and cancelled New Year celebrations. The retail industry was affected globally by reduced business hours or temporary closures.
Retail outlets in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 per cent.
Retail outlets in North America and the Middle East declined by 50-60 per cent.
In addition, the epidemic has led to a 33-43 per cent decline in passenger traffic from shopping centres in the month of February.
Shopping centre operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as increasing health facilities, installing heat scanners to measure the physical temperature of buyers, and eliminating some activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people were unemployed in China during the peak of the Wukhan epidemic.
There were close to 300 million farmers in China, many of whom were left behind in the interior provinces or in Hubei Province. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans had been unemployed and had applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis, the new coronary virus could lead to unemployment of 47 million people in the United States and 32 per cent in the United States. The Indian blockade has resulted in thousands of.
In the second half of March, 400,000 French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 100,000 British workers applied for general benefits. Close to 500,000 companies in Germany introduced a government-subsidized reduced working hours for their employees.
Both France and the United Kingdom have introduced German compensation for part-time work.
The performing and cultural industries have also been hard hit by the epidemic, and the functioning of organizations and employees and individuals around the globe have not been spared.
The Arts and Cultural Industries Organization strives to uphold its mission (usually funded by the Government) by demonstrating cultural heritage to the community, preserving the safety of its employees and the public, and supporting artists to the extent possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, performing places and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and original exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or postponed.
In response to this situation, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The epidemic has also recently resulted in many religious services, major sporting events and other social events (such as concerts, concerts, technical seminars)
The film industry was also hit. The Vatican announced that it would cancel the holy week to be observed in Rome in the last week of Ramadan, south of Christianity.
Many parishes suggest that older Christians stay at home and that places of worship are not used for places of worship; some churches practise worship through radio, online live broadcasts or television, while others allow in-car worship.
Other religious groups have also cancelled or restricted gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and places of worship, owing to the closure of churches and churches in the Roman Catholic District and the absence of Christian pilgrims.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the subsequent closure of holy sites, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the Mecca and Metina.
The pandemic has caused the worst damage to the world sports agenda since the Second World War.
Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 European championship contests, 2019-20 supercontests, 2020 European championship contests, 2019-20 Nba
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 summer Olympic Games planned for the end of July; on 24 March, IOC announced that the games would be "rescheduled to 2020," but not later than 2021.
This in turn led to a shift towards online gambling, with several web-based gambling websites reporting a significant increase in their new registrations. The entertainment industry was also affected, and various music groups suspended or cancelled circuits.
Many large theatres, such as cyclones, have also suspended all performances.
Some artists have also sought to continue producing and sharing works through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live concerts or the creation of a network of "festivals" for performances, distribution and publicity.
On the Internet, many networks on the subject of new coronary viruses spread out and, in the midst of uncertainty, many people began to turn to a ghost and attention-shifting approach.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asian and people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have experienced incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred.
The numerous reports of February this year (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) document the racist sentiments against Chinese by different groups around the world that Chinese should be infected with the virus or subjected to so-called legitimate reprisals.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also increased in some African countries.
It is reported that a large number of residents in the Wuhan and Hubei regions are subject to geographical discrimination.
There is a voice, both online and online, to support the Chinese and the inhabitants of the severely affected areas.
As the epidemic spread to other hot spots, Italy became the first European COVID-19 country in which populations from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Korea initially signed petitions
In Japan, the topic # ChineseDontComeToJapan, launched on Twitter, was widely disseminated.
Chinese and other Asian nationals in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing racial abuse and attacks.
The President of the United States, Donald Tranp, has been criticized for referring to the new coronary virus as the "Chinese virus," which is perceived by critics as racial discrimination and anti-Chinese tendencies.
Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari, carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.
Students from north-eastern India (bordering China) and attending major cities in India were also reportedly harassed by the outbreak of new coronary viruses.
The Chairman of the Indian People's Party Western Bengal State, Dilip Gosch, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and that "the above empires had to retaliate against them."
These statements were later denounced by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as "mistakes." In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents were also exacerbated by the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage,"
Many newspapers with pay walls have removed payment wall restrictions for partial or full coverage of new coronary viruses.
A number of epidemiological-related scientific papers have been made public by many scientific publishers.
Some scientists have also chosen to share their research findings quickly on pre-printed servers such as bioRxiv.

COVID-19 Workplace prevention
COVID-19 Workplace prevention refers to the use of dangerous occupational safety and health measures to prevent coronary virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriateness of risk prevention in the workplace depends on the specific workplace and tasks and should be determined on the basis of risk assessments of exposure sources, the severity of community diseases and risk factors for individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure is the least exposed to the public and other colleagues, and basic infection precautions are recommended, including hand-washing, occupational segregation
Moderate exposure risks include the need for regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes staff who reach out to the general public, such as schools, high population density work environments and some large retail environments.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should use efficient air filters and spraying protective devices for ventilation, personal protective equipment and other hazardous precautions during exposure to COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers that there is a high risk of exposure to health and home staff who are known or suspected to be COVID-19 patients, if the staff member has performed aerosol-generating operations from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Hazard control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering control, such as pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.
The outbreak of COVID-19 could have serious effects in the workplace.
Staff may be absent because of illness, need to care for others or fear of exposure.
There may also be changes in business patterns, including changes in demand for or access to commodities (e.g. purchases during non-peak periods, or the use of delivery or removal services).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the logistics of products from high-risk areas of the COVID-19 epidemic. Plans for the prevention and response of infectious diseases can be used to guide protection actions.
These plans address the level of risk associated with various workplace and work tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from family and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the precautions needed to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Plans to prevent and respond to infectious diseases may need to be subject to national or local advice.
Targets for responding to the outbreak included reducing inter-worker transmission, protecting populations at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the community in which the enterprise operates.
The hazard control level is the regulatory framework widely used in occupational safety and health and is used to classify hazard control measures according to effectiveness.
If the hazards of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control and, ultimately, personal protective equipment.
Engineering control, which involves separating staff from work-related hazards rather than relying on staff behaviour for control, is also the least cost-effective solution.
Administrative control refers to changes in work policies or procedures that require action by staff members or employers themselves.
PPE has a less defensive effect than engineering and administrative controls, but helps to prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE are to be selected according to the hazard level faced by the staff member and must be properly worn (e.g. breathing), regularly inspected and maintained, if necessary to avoid replacement, storage and decontamination.
Under the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure is the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces adopt basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, home isolation of sick employees, cough or spraying to follow respiratory procedures, provide paper turban and garbage drums, prepare
Timely identification and segregation of potential infectious individuals are key to the protection of workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that employees with acute respiratory symptoms should be kept in isolation for at least 24 hours until the absence of hot, heat and any other symptoms is determined. Sick leave policy should be flexible
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risks include those requiring frequent or close contact within 6 feet (1.8 m) with unknown or suspected COVID-19, but may cause a person to spread to a community near the workplace.
Such staff include protective clothing in schools, high-density working environments and high-volume buffers Efforts Intensifying staff members in the general public. Protective equipment for this group and high-risk groups includes ventilation.
Such staff would ideally need to be equipped with respirators.
In the event of illness on board an aircraft, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including arranging the patient to a distance of 6 feet away from other passengers, designating a crew to cover the patient. Or
Crew members shall wear one-time medical gloves when caring for sick travellers, touch fluids or potential contaminated surfaces. They shall also wear any additional symptoms such as hot, continuous cough or respiratory.
Gloves and other one-off items should be treated in bio-hazard bags, followed by cleaning and disinfection of contaminated surfaces. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard precautions also include travel
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the segregated room. For schools and child-care settings, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommend that schools be completely closed for short periods of time, regardless of community spread.
For medium and low-level community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as elimination of other large gatherings such as field visits, rallies and sports classes, joinder or cafeteria meals, increased office distance
In cases of high levels of community transmission, in addition to social distance strategies, extended school breaks may be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform routine routine activities, the CDC considers that they face a lower direct health risk.
It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who must have access to COVID-19 identify patients or suspected individuals act at the same level of protection as medical first aid technicians, including with appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, staff members shall cleaning and decontaminating their cashew belts and equipment before reusing home cleaning sprays or sabotage and shall comply with standard PPP sealing procedures
OSHA considers certain health care and accommodation staff to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
Staff at high risk of exposure include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff who are physically exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 infected persons.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff carry out foam generation procedures for known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process samples of infected or suspected infected persons.
Foam generation procedures include plumbing, cough induction procedures, bronchial screenings, some dental procedures and examinations, or pyrology collection.
High-risk foam mortuary staff include staff involved in the collation of dead bodies, who were previously COVID-19 diagnosed or suspected cases, and additional risk of exposure if autopsies are performed. ID
Some health-care facilities and morgues may also be equipped with a specialized pressure ventilation system.
Biosafety level 3 precautions should be taken in the handling of samples.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends the designation of different waiting areas for patients on the basis of whether they are COVID-19 suspected cases. OHS recommends, in addition to other personal protective equipment, persons known or suspected to be infected. SARS-Co.
The United States requires the use of N95 filters or better masks approved by NIOSH in the context of comprehensive statutory respiratory protection schemes such as health tests, training, medical examinations, etc.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. Who does not recommend the use of protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through liquid fluids.
Who Recommended that screening persons at entry points only wear a medical surgical mask.
For staff who are required to collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients and to provide care or transfer services to patients without performing foam generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of medical surgical masks, burns or glasses.
If foam generation procedures are to be implemented, medical surgical masks must be replaced with N95 or FFP2 masks.
In view of the inadequate supply of PPM equipment globally, WHO recommends that physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, direct caregivers only be allowed to access COVID-19 patients' rooms and that multiple PPE be used
SARS-CoV-2 outnumbered millions globally
Data from John-Hopkins University indicate that the total number of global SARS-CoV-2 coronary virus infections has exceeded 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to diseases caused by coronary viruses - COVID-19.
On the same day of the milestone, Malawi confirmed the country's first coronary virus infection and the first death related to the coronary virus in Zambia.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea declared that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that had no coronary virus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 105,1635 confirmed cases, including 79332 cases within 24 hours prior to 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) in central Europe on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronary virus cases have been recorded, resulting in at least 59,000 deaths.
CBS news cites data from John-Hopkins University that, on Wednesday, coronary virus infections killed more than 1,000 people in the United States.
Throughout the world, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of disease.
On Thursday, the Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the sealed city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians throughout the country would continue to receive compensation for the suspension of work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; it was adopted by 215 votes to 10, with 1 abstention.

201. Coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and haste.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle acid pain, diarrhoea, swallowed pain, sniffing loss and diarrhoea.
The probability period from exposure to morbidity ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.
Although most cases have minor symptoms, some of them develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
By 17 April 2020, 210 countries and territories worldwide had reported more than 224,000 cases and more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people are currently treated and rehabilitated. The virus is transmitted mainly between people through close contact, often via cough, spraying or foam generated when speaking.
Although the call gas can produce foams, the foam usually falls on the ground or on the surface of various objects and does not result in long-range transmission.
In addition, if people touch the surface of the virus and then touch their eyes and nose, they may also be infected with the virus.
The virus can survive on the object's surface for up to 72 hours.
Although it is also possible to spread in the pre- and post-recovery stages, the first three days of the disease are the most contagious. The standard diagnostic method is a real-time reversal of the RRT (RRT).
People suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
The suggestion that the public should wear a mask varies from one place to another, with some authorities opposing the wearing of a mask and others demanding that it be worn.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine or ultra-antivirus treatment programme.
The vast majority of countries in all six WHO regions have reported partial transmission of the disease.
People living with the virus may have no symptoms or suspicious influenza symptoms, such as fever, cough, lack of power and haste.
Acute symptoms include breathing difficulties, continuing chest pain or chest slurry, vague consciousness, difficult to awakening and face or mouth; in the event of these symptoms, immediate medical attention.
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms, such as spraying, nose aldicarb or throat.
A different proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, were also monitored.
Some Chinese cases were initially characterized by chest and cardiac symptoms.
Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure and even cause death.
We call it a latent period.
COVID-19 usually has a latent period of 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.
97.5 per cent of infected persons will suffer symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report states that not all infected persons will suffer from symptoms.
The role of persons with symptoms in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully defined; however, there is preliminary evidence that people with symptoms may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with symptoms has not yet been determined and research is continuing. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Centre (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of confirmed cases showed no symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Council of China has included cases of symptoms in its daily newsletter since 1 April; of the 166 infections at that date, 130 (78 per cent) were tested without symptoms.
Both hydraulic and saline fluids can carry a large number of viruses.
Big speech spills more bubbles than normal speech.
A Singapore study found that cough-free cough could lead to the most distant transmission of foam 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although such viruses are generally not transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States has determined that they may be transmitted via biosols, and air collectors on off-site corridors have tested viruses RNA positive samples.
Medical procedures such as injection and cardiovascular recovery (CPR) may aerosol respiratory endocrine, leading to air transmission.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through faeces, but this risk is considered to be low. The virus is most contagious when the patient suffers symptoms; although it may be transmitted before the symptoms.
The European Centre for Surveillance and Control (ECDC) indicated that although the transmission power of the neo-coronary virus is not yet fully clear, general 1 people will be infected between 2 and 3 people. The virus
Specifically, new coronary viruses are known to survive one day on paper boards, up to three hours in plastics (polypropene) and ruble steel (AISI 304) and 99 per cent in pure products
However, their survival times are also affected by humidity and temperature.
If properly used, soap and cleaning agents can also have the effect of extinguishing the virus. Soap products degrade the fats of the virus and render it inactive while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as phenzalmonium and chlor-alkali (an surgical disinfection solution), have been less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China, shows that, on average, saline samples.
5 / 6 patients had the highest number of viruses in their first sample and 1 / 6 had the highest number of viruses detected the following day.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), beginning with three pneumonia patients from a group of acute respiratory diseases in Vukhan.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronary virus associated with nature.
Before the virus enters the human body, it can be eliminated by domestic soap, which can destroy the virus's protective film. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
Lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cell via vascular stress conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2), which has the highest concentration of lung type II lung.
The virus is integrated with ACE2 through a special surface sugar protein called "Tunisia" (particles) into the hostel cell.
Of the patients admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, 12 per cent found acute heart damage and a higher proportion of seriously ill patients.
Cardiovascular symptoms are more frequent as a result of general inflammatory and immune system disorders as a result of disease deterioration, but acute cardiovascular damage may also be associated with heart ACE2.
ACE2 Receptors express and participate in the regulation of heart functions in the heart.
ICU is known to have a high incidence of blood boses (31%) and intravenous blood bolts (25%) in care of COVID-19, which may be associated with progneumatic examination
Although SARS-COV-2 is inflammatory to the respiratory cells of the adulthood ACE2, COVID-19 severely ill patients are subject to a pneumonia response.
In particular, COVID-19 pathogenic in patients GM-CSF endocrT cells are associated with the collection of hepatitis IL-6 endocrine monomer cells and severe lung pathology.
The autopsy report also saw the leaching of lymphone cells.
Who has published several disease detection programmes.
The standard method of detection is the use of a real-time reverse polymeric enzyme chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
This test is usually tested for respiratory samples obtained through nose swallowed; however, nose gauges or hydraulic samples may also be used.
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours and two days.
Blood tests can also be performed, but two blood sampling times of two weeks are required, with the result that there is little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate coronary viruses strains and publish gene sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymeric chain responses (PCR) testing agents to detect infection with the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (not only operational infections can be detected, but also individuals who have been infected with the virus in the past) is still under development but has not yet been rolled out.
Based on China's experience, the accuracy of testing is only 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the United States FDA approved the first instant diagnostic reagent and became operational at the end of the month. The diagnostic guide issued by the Minan Hospital of Wuhan University sets out a clinical and epidemiological.
Early infections are more frequent than lung grinding glass, with asymmetry and backscattering.
With the development of the virus, pneumonia can become visible in the chest, gravel signs (lung bubble surpluses to varying degrees with small leaf spacing) and lungs.
Very little information is available on COVID-19 micropathological injuries and pathological physiology.
The main findings of the autopsy were as follows:
Eye screening: Chest meningitis, pneumonia, pneumonia mutation and lungs
Four levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Mild pneumonia: Pneumonia, lung cell growth, large numbers of non-typical pulmonary cells, meshepatitis accompanied by lymphoba cell infestation and multi-nuclear cells
Severe pneumonia: Contagious pneumonia damage (DAD) is accompanied by contagious pneumonia infiltration.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe anaemia.
Resuscitation pneumonia: Hydraulic seepage of pneumonia and pneumatic fibres
Blood: Dispersive vascular concrete (DIC); infant-child red cell reaction
Preventive measures that can be taken to reduce infection rates include staying at home; avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas; often washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; avoiding
The CDC proposes to cover the slogans with paper towels when cough or spraying; if they do not, it is suggested that they be covered from within the mangrove.
It is recommended that hand hygiene be properly cleaned after cough or spraying.
DC proposes to wear face masks in public places to some extent prevent the transmission of viruses by invalids. The core of social distance strategies is to close schools and workplaces, limit travel and cancel large public gatherings.
In addition, social distance guidelines provide for a minimum of 6 feet (1.8 m) distance in interpersonal interaction.
There are no effective drugs to prevent COVID-19. Given that vaccine development is expected to take at least 2021, efforts to reduce the epidemic peak are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, which is known. "
At the same time, the DC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and running water up to 20 seconds, especially after toilets or visible sludge on hand, before cooking, and after nose.
In addition, it is recommended to use alcohol-containing hand-washing fluids of at least 60 per cent, but only in the absence of soap and running water. For areas where water-free water cannot be purchased, WHO
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydroxide is not a "cell sterilizer."
Glycerine is added as a moisture preserver.
People are provided with support care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and other vital organ support that is affected.
CDC recommends that persons suspected of having a virus wear improvised masks.
An in vitro film oxygen compound (ECMO) has been used to mitigate the effects of respiratory failure, but its benefits have yet to be studied.
It is recommended to improve immunization by maintaining hygiene and promoting healthy lifestyles and dietary habits.
For those with early symptoms, support therapy may be effective. Who and the National Health and Health Council of China launched an initiative calling for proper care of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital for treatment.
American experts in critical diseases and lung specialists have compiled and made available free of charge through IBCC the treatment proposals made by various agencies.
As of April 2020, COVID-19 was not developed.
In response to certain symptoms, some medical experts have recommended the use of pyrolysis (ethylamidophyl PCP) to replace Blofin for first-line treatment.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, with particular attention to protection when performing operations that may result in aerosols, such as plumbing or ventilation, in a medical environment.
For health-care providers caring for COVID-19 patients, CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure prevention measures and air-borne prevention measures, patients should be transferred to air-borne infectious disease isolation room (AIIR). CDC Summary guidelines
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, it is preferable to use respirators (rather than masks).
While N95 masks are authorized for industrial use, FDA has authorized the use of such masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is used primarily to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust) but cannot be used for other purposes to ensure effective insulation of specific biological formulations.
In the absence of masks, the DC proposes to use masks and, if necessary, wear self-prepared masks.
Most COVID-19 cases have minor symptoms and do not require mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Health personnel are actively undertaking research aimed at providing respiratory support to COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms. There is evidence that gas injection can be avoided through high nasal-flow oxygen therapy.
It is not clear whether the two treatment options are equally effective for seriously ill patients.
If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use innovative mechanical ventilation because this technique can also limit the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high flow through nose. Older persons (over 60 years of age)
In many developed countries, the number of beds per capita is insufficient and, given medical conditions, the health system is unable to cope with the critical situation resulting from the surge in COVID-19 cases, which necessitates hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5 per cent of patients were to be taken to a custody room for serious illness, 2.3 per cent to have mechanical ventilation and 1.4 per cent to die as a result.
About 30 per cent of COVID-19 admissions in China were eventually sent to ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) triggered by COVID-19, mechanical ventilation is becoming more complex and oxygen is becoming more difficult.
The stress control model and high PEEP breathing apparatus will then be used to maximize the delivery of oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung damage and chest from respirators.
Old breathing apparatus may not achieve high PEEP.
Research on potential therapies began in January 2020 and a number of antiretrovirals have now entered the clinical trial phase.
Ridsewe appears to be the most potent drug at present.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or have reached the advanced testing stage.
Serious patients can experiment with anti-retroviral drugs.
Who Call on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential therapy effectiveness and safety tests. FDA has provisionally authorized the restoration of blood blood transfusions as experimental treatment for life-threatening serious cases.
The necessary clinical studies have not been carried out to demonstrate the safe and effective treatment of the disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain the outbreak.
Users are required to enter names and identification numbers as required.
This application can gauge the potential risk of infection by testing "close contact" with monitoring data.
Each user may also check the status of three other users.
Once a potential risk has been detected, the application will not only recommend self-segregation, but also alert local health officials. Combined use of mobile data big data analysis, face-to-face identification techniques, cellular tracking and human intelligence. Tracking
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security agencies to track mobile phone data on suspected coronary virus carriers.
The aim of this measure is to enforce segregation and protect groups who may be exposed to infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, the German telecommunications and the German federal government agency, Robert Koh Institute, shared the aggregated cell phone location data in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed face-to-face identification techniques to detect persons who violate the rules of separation.
According to the Italian Regional Commissioner for Health, Giulio Gallera, data from mobile phone operators "40 per cent of citizens are still moving around."
The German Government organized a 48-hour weekend, black Marathon, with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions on a global scale to prevent the spread of the coronary virus.
Isolation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of self-infection can all be troubling.
BBC cites Rory O'Connor's view that "social isolation, isolation, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are perfect storms that harm the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease is more moderate, with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as general influenza.
Cases of mild illness can normally be recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to other similar viruses (e.g. SARS and MERS), pregnant women are at a higher risk of becoming COVID-19 severely ill, but lack data support. COVID-19 may cause pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, haemorrhaging or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19 Relevant complications include haemorrhagia, concrete anomalies, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Six per cent of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital had concrete anomalies, in particular the extension of the original gasoline time, while 4 per cent of the group had kidney disorders.
About 20-30% of the COVID-19 patients' liver enzymes (transmonia) were elevated.
According to the same report, the average time between morbidity and mortality was 10 days, with the average hospitalization time being 5 days.
However, the average time of hospitalization to death for patients transferred to ICU was seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with an overall time range of 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Council of China (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for males and 1.7 per cent for females.
Autopsy pulmonary samples and the organization's pathological examination indicate that both lungs are subjected to corrosive pulmonary bubble damage accompanied by cell fibre anomalies.
Viral cell changes were observed in lung cells.
Lung images are similar to those of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by the National Board of Health and Health of China, 11.8 per cent resulted from heart damage due to increased muscle calcium protein levels or heart disruption.
According to data released in the United States in March, 89 per cent of admitted patients had prior medical history. The availability of medical resources and regional socio-economic conditions could also affect mortality rates.
Estimates of disease mortality vary according to regional differences and methodological difficulties.
Underestimation of cases of petty disease may lead to overestimation of mortality.
However, if the death is due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers have developed a 1.4-fold high rate of COVID-19 seriously ill patients, requiring intensive custody or death rates some 2.4 times higher. Concern was expressed about the long-term legacy of the.
The Hospital Authority in Hong Kong, China, found a 20-30 per cent reduction in the lung activity of some of the rehabilitators, with lung scanning showing damage to organs.
In addition, rehabilitation may lead to post-partum syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is uncertain whether past infections will lead to effective long-lasting immunization of the rehabilitated.
Other coronary viruses were identified as potentially immunized, but some COVID-19 cases were reported to be tested positive shortly after rehabilitation.
These cases are considered to be continuing to deteriorate rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered to be a natural virus that originates from animals and is infected through spillover.
The actual origin has not yet been determined, but by December 2019 the infection was almost entirely interpersonal.
The first case study of COVID-19, published by Lancet in January 2020, showed the earliest date of morbidity as 1 January 2019.
Who The earliest date of morbidity reported in official publications was 12 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality rates.
These figures vary from region to region and vary over time and are influenced by testing levels, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the first outbreak of the epidemic and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status.
By the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths, and U07.2 to Clinical or Epidemiological Infection COID
According to statistics from John Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as at 17 April 2020 was 6.9 per cent (153,822 / 2,240,191).
Mortality rates vary from region to region. Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflect the percentage of confirmed cases of disease and the percentage of undiagnosed cases (including confirmed cases).
These statistics are time-bound and track the entire process from infection to case resolution for specific populations.
Although not all infected persons are resistant, the presence of resistance provides information on the number of infected persons.
The Italian Epidemiological Centre Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with a population of 4600, with 80 people (1.7 per cent) now dying of the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various fanatical days, even among young people, but mortality is relatively low and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially categorized.
In addition, the German medical system is already overburdened.
An assessment by blood donors shows that about 3 per cent of Dutch citizens may be resistant.
To date, 69 people (0.004 per cent of the total population) have been identified as having died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and mortality rates vary by gender.
Studies in China and Italy show that male mortality is higher than female mortality rates.
Men are at the highest risk of death between the ages of 50 and 60, with only a close gender gap in the age group of 90 years.
China has a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent for males and 1.7 per cent for females.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unclear, but may be caused by genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based differences in immunization, the lower prevalence of smoking among women and the lower age at which men experience syndrome, such as hypertension, lead to higher mortality rates among men than among women.
In Europe, men account for 57 per cent of infections, and men account for 72 per cent of all deaths due to COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the United States Government had yet to track gender-related data on COVID-19 infection.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher, as is the rate of exposure to the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease "COVID-19."
Who leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained: CO represented the "champion," VI on the "virus," D on disease, "19 on the first outbreak of the disease (20112).
The name was chosen to avoid the invocation of specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or populations in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigmatization. Introduction of COVID-19 as the virus acute respiratory syndrome
In addition, WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "Introduction of COVID-19 virus" in mass communication.
Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronary viruses."
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronary virus" and "uterine coronary virus."
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary viruses and disease names, based on the 2015 guidance on the use of location in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have started printing health-care materials, such as nose watches and respiratory components.
For example, an Italian hospital was in desperate need of ventilation valves, with suppliers unable to deliver parts within the required time, a local start-up company performing reverse works and printing the 100 ventilation valves required.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy, misinformation and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were spread rapidly through the network.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
No evidence of the replication of the virus was found in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research and the development of vaccines and medicines for the treatment of COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity experiment" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing anti-virus compounds that are most likely to produce therapeutic effects.
There is no vaccine yet, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.
As both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through ACE2 receptors, the results of previous work by SARS-CoV need to be used.
Three vaccine strategies are being studied.
First, researchers plan to develop a full-virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, both inactive and neonatal, is aimed at triggering rapid human immune response at the time of new infections COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop subunit vaccines aimed at developing a vaccine that motivates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such research focused on the S-irritation protein that supported the infiltration of the virus into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the experimental vaccines developed under the above-mentioned strategies must be tested. In 2020, on 16 March, four Seattle volunteers launched their first clinical vaccine trials.
Vaccines contain a non-gene sequence that is replicable from the virus that generates the disease. It has been argued that resistance dependency enhancement can be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines.
By April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.
Seven tests have been assessed and approved for malaria treatment, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chlorine quaquine.
Conversions of antiretrovirals account for the vast majority of Chinese research, with nine third clinical trials on Ridsewee to be conducted in a number of countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing anti-virus drugs are currently being assessed for COVID-19 treatment, including Sedway
As of March 2020, the efficacy of the treatment in Ridsewee has been prima facie confirmed.
The clinical symptoms of patients treated with compassionate medications were observed to have slowed down.
At this stage, the United States, China and Italy are conducting a third clinical trial. In February 2020, China initiated a chlor-alkali (previously used to treat malaria) study and produced preliminary results.
However, a call was made for a peer review of the study.
The health authorities of the Republic of Korea and China have recommended the use of chlorine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Epidemiology recommended a daily dose of 1 g, reminding that the doses were very dangerous and could even be fatal.
By 28 March 2020, FDA had issued emergency use authorizations for chlorine and hydrochlorine, but doctors had the right to decide whether to treat COVID-19 patients. The seventh edition of the Chinese guide also proposed the use.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of Libavelin have inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
After validating SARS-CoV-2 low concentration inhibitors, further in-vitro studies are recommended using nitazolite. Studies indicate that cross-meningine dioxic acid Co2 (TMRS SS2)
There are serious limitations in the studies of chlorine quine and hydrochloroquine, whether combined with Achicoxin or not, which cannot be accepted by the medical community unless further research is carried out. OD-2 Not
Cell storms may become a complication of later treatment by COVID-19 seriously ill patients.
There is evidence that hydrochloroquine may have anti-cell storm properties. Upon completion of a small study, the National Health Council of China included the tapet resistance in the treatment guidelines.
Following the positive results of the tests for seriously ill patients, Italy is conducting a national level 2 non-random test.
In conjunction with blood and iron protein tests, cell storms are identified with the aim of deterring the development of the disease, which is believed to lead to the death of some of the infected.
In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, FDA approved the use of white cell doses to treat other causes of incurable cell factors such as CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no random cross-checking evidence that the tapee is effective in treating CRS.
The extraction of pure enrichment resistance from COVID-19 rehabilitated immune systems is being studied and injected to people in need as passive immunotherapy prior to successful vaccine development.
SARS tried this strategy during the epidemic, but the efficacy of the therapy has yet to be determined.
The virus is and is an expected role mechanism for passive antiretrovirals to guide SARS-CoV-2 immunization.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody dependence cell toxicity and / or infestation can achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antimalarial therapy are being developed, such as the use of man-made mono-cloning resistance.
Haemorrhage during rehabilitation is likely to increase to facilitate rapid deployment. The serum consists of the liquid part of the blood of the rehabilitated patient, which includes specific heterosexual resistance to the virus.
Coronary virus disease, a closely related syndrome
Li Shin, a doctor at Vukhan Central Hospital, raised awareness of the spread of the new coronary virus, which unfortunately contracted COVID-19 and died.
Australian shops have lowered the maximum number of sanitary paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday, Australia's chains, Woolworth and Coles, reduced the maximum purchase of each traded sanitary paper for all their shops nationwide to two and one package, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a one-size-fits-all restriction on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of news on the bank desk or on the Facebook page of the chain.
It was reported that buyers had accumulated goods for fear of COVID-19 in order to prevent them from being isolated.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also limited the purchase of sanitary paper for door-to-door delivery to a single package.
Prior to these changes, Woolworth and Coles introduced restrictions on four packages per transaction on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
In its press release of 8 March, Coles reported that "many shops were still unavailable within one hour of arrival" after the restrictions on the purchase of four bags and that the demand was "unprecedented on Tuesday," ALD
According to a Woolworth spokesperson, sales had increased "sharply" last week.
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra was also limited to two parcels.
To further mitigate the shortfall, Coles ordered more packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworth ordered additional stocks, and ALDI prepared inventories in advance for the planned Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said that retailers tried to increase stocks, but the local council restrictions on truck delivery time made this difficult.
He expected that production costs would increase as suppliers tried to meet their needs, while preferential activities would be reduced.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that a number of shops would not be able to hold Wednesday preferential events after early release of stocks.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert from the University of Science and Technology of Queensland, stated that stores replenish stocks every night.
He said that sanitary paper was a large item, so that stocks were smaller and that, once sold, huge shell space would be left, exacerbating the perception of a shortage of materials.
The view of Coles and Woolworth is that if there is much on the shell, goods like cartridges and hand-washing fluids can be [bought] and in sufficient quantities, you may say Rus. "
The manufacturer of recycled sanitary paper, Who Giva Crapb, indicated last Wednesday that they were no longer in stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberley-Clark, who produced comfortable and hygienic paper, and Solaris, who made Sorbent sanitary paper, all stressed that they were working round-the-clock.
The real estate website Domain.com reported that some real estate vendors offered free sanitary paper to the first bidder at an auction held in Melbourne owing to the small number of auctions that the buyer had to break on weekends.
The NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, contains eight pages in its Thursday version to be used as a sanitary paper for scrapping.
According to ABC Australia's report of 3 March, shops were initially unwilling to impose restraints, and they stated that they did not plan to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other commodities, including masks, hand-washing, dry, hand-washing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Ocado, Online Online UK, limited the purchase of Andrres sanitary paper to two packages on Sunday evening for 12 volumes per package.

We have experienced some difficult circumstances since this month.
In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we have a clear sense of solidarity in the destiny of all humanity and of our responsibility to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best measures to address them require people all over the world to feel, work together and promote community-building, which is the core philosophy of Wikimedia.
The exchange of fraternity and care among all our colleagues by e-mail, telephone and chat is a testament to the distinctive points of our colleagues, who have the privilege of working with you.
I am very grateful and proud to be with you.
Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.
Let me be aware of how meaningful it is for the world to use Wikipedia at this time, and of the symbolic power that this vital resource brings to people around the world to maintain its proper functioning.
Whether your work is responsible for the operation of the website, the payment of salaries or community safety, the proper functioning of Wikimedia depends on your hard work.
More than ever before, the world needs information from Wikipedia.
At this stage, the content and even the way in which we work will have an important impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities of our colleagues, we will make some important adjustments to our collaborative approach from next week.
Working methods and schedule adjustments
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the senior management team met yesterday evening to discuss the company's modus operandi and timetable for the next few days to months.
At that meeting, we considered what we believe is an appropriate response to the current challenges facing companies, as well as best practices to ensure that companies maintain sustainable development during the epidemic.
The senior management team agreed to relieve pressure on company staff so that they can sustain their support for the company's mission.
We support you in properly reducing the pressure on your work.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), subject to subsequent changes.
This adjustment is not a false announcement. If you can work longer on a daily basis, we will have a long assignment to you in accordance with your hours of work.
However, given the unpredictable nature of the current world situation, priority will be given to your personal needs, such as care for family members, outdoor shopping or medical consultations.
We will not follow your working hours.
If you are ill, let you get down to work.
That is self-evident, but we would like to remind you of that.
You do not need sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team revise the work calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan, the human and cultural operators, who will support you and ensure that your situation receives due attention from management.)
In the case of part-time employees, we will pay them in full.
We have already expressed our commitment and reaffirmed our commitment to adhere to the commitments made to contractors and hourly workers.
Our pay to all will continue to be calculated on the basis of their remuneration for normal working hours.
Even you are ill or unable to work.
If you are willing to work, we will support you.
Many chose to unlock their pressures by communicating with the outside world through their work.
Our work can yield incredible returns, especially in times such as the present one.
But care for themselves is still the first place.
We ask you to communicate with the manager so that we can be kept abreast of your situation and adjust it accordingly.
Priority is given to safeguarding vital work.
We must maintain the proper functioning of some important work.
The work of the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operations team, the trust and security team and the fund-raising team (and other teams) is essential and may require additional support.
We will begin to assess the current goals with all sectors and shift our focus to support some of the matters that are essential to our mission.
We all have much work to do, but we need to focus our work on the most important items.
A temporary slowdown would not affect future developments.
We do not intend to "work overtime" after the epidemic.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet your working hours, as it now seems impractical.
We accept that the current environment has changed, and we will set new targets and timetables, as appropriate.
What will APP (annual plan) change?
In order to adapt to new realities and daily working time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time for budget formulation to enable staff to prioritize key work and care for themselves and their families, while adjusting working arrangements for those who need or wish to reduce.
The extension of the schedule would significantly reduce the current planned workload and reduce the pressure on work throughout the Organization.
We will present these proposals to the Board next week. If they are adopted, we will update the working arrangements for follow-up to delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thank the APP team for its leadership in this process.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague from the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, for the sake of caution, we have hired anti-virus cleaners to fully sterilize the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-level disinfection solutions to dissipate surfaces and halls and elevators leading to our floors.
The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement and using the corresponding products to secure tenants.
We are confident that the Office is fully prepared to come to you when you decide to return to work.
Our Washington, D.C. office is based on the WeWorkoffice, which shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington, D.C. staff.
As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office had been converted to a full-time remote location, in line with the guidance we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some colleagues in the New York office have already been aware, we have also been discussing issues related to the leasing of office space in the Brooklyn area.
These discussions continue, but may be postponed.
For the first time, some colleagues were contacted to work remotely.
Other long-term telemedicine colleagues would like to provide them with some suggestions for adapting their working methods:
Meeting time should be kept within one to two hours.
If more time is required, consideration should be given to decentralizing the content of the meetings to multiple dates.
Clearly define the objectives of the meeting, set the agenda for the meeting and send reading materials in advance.
Videoconferencing is used as a default meeting modality, with online collaboration and networking using tools such as Google Doc and Zoom.
In each meeting, one moderator will chair, one person will be responsible for monitoring questions in the chat window and tracking changes in the list of speakers, and another will be responsible (or in multi-person collaboration) for the proceedings.
If you need a comfortable headphone, please send an e-mail to contact the technical support unit.
Your health allowance is used to buy zero food.
Insert # remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations Team is studying the manual engineering guidance in the form of webinars to help all Foundations colleagues to improve their efficiency during their distributed office hours.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public activities funded by Wikimedia, such as editors, before WHO announced the end of the epidemic.
These requests for cancellation of activities and other restrictions may result in the failure of recipients of these communities to complete their intended contributions, and we have informed them that we understand this and have pledged that no one will be punished for postponing or modifying them.
In the following week, we will continue to provide more guidance at community meetings and thematic community meetings in Wikimania and elsewhere.
The global community now appears to be mourning the grief caused by the devastation of the epidemic, but it also reflects a sense of comfort in being able to maintain a clear focus on their respective communities, Wikimedia.
In the future, the CRT team will set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for communities to monitor impact and track community-to-our communications.
Maintain contact to communicate COVID-19-related issues
We plan to convene a special staff meeting next Friday at 14: 00 (UTC) / 07: 00 (Pacific time), and we will send an invitation to you later in the calendar.
At this meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and allow some time for an exchange of views.
We stand united and do our best to help you.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this e-mail and other important information relevant to COVID-19 at the Office Wiki.
The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and bring all information together in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries / areas currently severely affected by the epidemic.
If you have any doubts about travel, activities, main workflows or insurance, or if you need other help, please contact and cooperate with the CRT team at any time.
We are ready to provide you with the support and liaison you need here.
If you have an intimate or sensitive issue, please send an e-mail to contact Bryan Judan, Chief of Global Human Resources Operations.
Despite these changes, we cannot abandon our work and obligations as a result.
On the contrary, the epidemic reminds us that we may now need to adjust our work and obligations in ways that have not been done in the past.
We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to continue our work with each other, to provide the support needed for our actions and to continue to bring the services on which they depend to the world.
There can be no challenge if we are ready to plan at all times.
Now, I ask you to support each other in creating space for important work in the coming weeks and months.
We need all to contribute to that goal, and we therefore ask everyone to take care of themselves and their families in order to remain in the best position when needed.
Finally, I ask you to bear in mind that you wash hands and do not face the face.

Need to update COVID-19 Diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases"
By 6 February 2020, our team issued the Quick Recommendations Guide for the Diagnostic and Treatment of New Toponies (2019-nCoV) Infections, which provides lessons and lessons for a global response.
However, 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease, and our knowledge of the disease is increasing on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are being updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on the above-mentioned guidelines and provide updated "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" and based on the latest COVID-19 diagnostic programme issued by the National Health Health Council of the People.
In December 2019, 2019 new coronary virus (2019-nCoV) broke out, and the disease is now officially named 2019 Coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which was named.
On 11 March 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
In response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid recommendation guide, which was published online in Military Medical Research magazine on 2 February 2020.
Since its publication, it has attracted widespread attention.
It should be noted, however, that COVID-19 is a new type of disease and that our knowledge of the disease is increasing on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Health Council of the People's Republic of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /) has published a total of 7 editions of COVID-19 from 16 January 2020 to 3
Our guide now receives the views of Zhou et al., who propose a simple rating programme based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidance and valuable references to this global pandemic.
We acknowledge and thank them for their important work.
However, their proposals also need to be updated on the basis of the latest COVID-19 diagnostic programme (pilot version 7) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases requires a combination of an epidemiological history characteristic with two clinical performances for a comprehensive analysis and, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical:
Epidemiological history: (1) Previous exposure prior to symptoms 14 days Previous exposure (COVID-19) Previous exposure in Vukhan or in other communities with reported cases (2); SARS
Clinical performance: (1) heat and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) photographic properties with COVID-19 infections; and (3) normal or reduced number of early childhood white cells, and lymphometer.
Diagnoses of diagnosed cases should be based on a suspected case, with any of the following hypothesis or seropositive: (1) SARS-CoV-2 positive CRR (2);
As can be seen, the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions add real-time PCR tests in respiratory or blood markers.
The fourth (1-27 January 2020) and fifth (2-8 February 2020) editions have increased the prophylactic testing of blood signs; the seventh edition has since added blood seropositive evidence.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to study the best nucleate test boxes for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory labels, including blood mining, which increase the availability of different samples and provide evidence of positive results.
In addition, there is growing evidence that reminds us of the symptoms of atypical symptoms and symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify persons without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
In addition, the rating system needs to be validated in further clinical practices and studies.
Finally, we would like more direct evidence to emerge and call on the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we propose to refer to and follow the latest guidelines of the country in which the case is committed.
Our team will also help by updating our guidance in a timely manner.
5 new COVID-19 deaths reported in Bangladesh, a single-day high
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths that day.
This has created a new rate of single-day deaths due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Control (IEDC) recorded 114 confirmed cases and 33 cases were cured after rest in the home.
A cumulative total of 17 deaths.
At the online press conference, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, head of the IEDRC, stated that these deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were between the ages of 60 and over, two cases between the ages of 51 and 60 and one case between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also indicated that two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic disease (Pandemic).
A hospital official revealed to the local press, Anadolu Agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been treated at Kuwait Maitrer.
On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridge of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, announced through an online video that public traffic would be halted beyond the original plan until Saturday.
This public transport stop began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Essential goods, such as medical, fuel and food, continue to be transported normally.
On 8 March, two of the first COVID-19 confirmed cases recorded in Bangladesh returned from Italy and another patient was the wife of one of the diagnosed patients.
By 19 March, all three patients had been rehabilitated.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a major exodus
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 (diseases caused by coronary virus SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.
While the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease and not to the risk of a particular case, WHO notes the need to urge the Government to take measures:
"All countries / regions can still change the process of this pandemic.
"The Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said, if each country / region responded by testing, testing, treating, isolating, tracking and mobilizing its people.
"We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and severity, as well as the levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
In February, he commented at CNN that "except for influenza, no respiratory virus has been detected and continues to spread globally."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said that "we have never seen a general epidemic caused by the coronary virus before."
He continues to say, "Similarly, we have never seen a controlled pandemic of the virus."
Prior to the onset of the pandemic, in January, WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.
According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute for Sensitive and Infectious Diseases of the United States, "most importantly, it is still deteriorating."
By Thursday, the Federation had reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 globally, resulting in over 46,000 deaths.
2019 Laboratory testing methods for respiratory coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include detection of the presence of the virus and the generation of antibiotics.
RT-PCR can detect the coronary virus RNA and thus determine the presence of the virus in the sample.
This test is the characteristic test of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
They can be used to determine whether they have recently been infected or whether they have been sexually active.
Antibody testing (serum testing) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody testing shows how many people are infected with the virus, including those with mild symptoms without reporting or symptoms.
The results of this test determine the precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunization of the population groups.
Owing to the limited number of tests, no country / region was in a position to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population by March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country / region had more than 3 per cent of its population and the number of tests completed varied significantly from country to region.
This difference may also seriously affect the reported case mortality rate, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Real-time RRT-PCR (RRT-PCR) tests using swallowed throat watches are only completed within the first week of the virus before reliable results can be obtained.
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test, carried out using swallowed seismers, is only completed within the first week after the virus has been infected, and reliable results can be obtained.
Since then, the virus has disappeared in the throat but continues to flourish in the lung.
For infected persons tested in the second week of infection, samples may be substituted for deep respiratory extracts obtained by injection tubes, or cough extracts may be used (blood).
In January 2020, RRT-PCR was issued at CharitÃ© Hospital in Berlin, one of the early PCR tests and served as the basis for 250 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, WHO).
A detection method was also developed in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2020. On 28 January 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical level based on PCR's SARS-CoV-2 test.
It looked for "E" cartoons for all beta coronies, and SARS-CoV-2 for RdRp. In China, the China Large Vehicle (BGRS I Group).
The early version of the test agent box uses three gene testing methods, one of which is the inability to determine results due to reagent defects and the detection bottleneck in Atlanta CDC; this results in an average of 100.
The two-part test method was found to be reliable only on 28 February 2020, when the state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was authorized by the United States Food and Pharmaceutical Supervisory Authority on the basis of an emergency use authorization. The United States commercial laboratory started testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR could be conducted nationwide from 5 March 2020.
Quest Diagnostics similarly announced that a nationwide COVID-19 test would be available as of 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limits are announced; sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with the DC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 was developed and produced by the National Centre for Research on Epidemiology and Biotechnology (Vector).
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Health Supervisory Authority of the Russian Federation. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Meo clinic had developed a test box to detect COVID-19 infection, Diche 3
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued to Abbott Laboratory an emergency use authorization for testing using the Abbott m2000 system (EUScientific A); FDA was previously issued to Thologic.
An approximately 45-minute test method for Cepheid was also authorized for the emergency use of FDA on 21 March 2020.
FDA has approved a detection method to replace PCR with temperature augmentation technologies such as nuclear acid.
Since the method does not require a series of temperature cycles, positive results can be obtained only 5 minutes and negative results can be determined within 13 minutes.
The United States currently has approximately 18,000 such devices, and Abbott is expected to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a single-cloud resistant test (specifically like a new coronary virus) nuclear protein
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "the diagnostic value of chest tails at the early stages of the virus is small, while the performance of CT [computer crane scanning] may be evident even before the symptoms."
Typical features of CT include double lung grinding glass, exterior asymmetry and backscattering.
As the disease progresses, it will be developed to become visible in the chest, rock feet and lung mutations.
A study of PC R and CT in Vukhan (where the current pandemic began) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but that CT is less precise and that many of its visual characteristics overlap with other pneumonia.
As of March 2020, the American Radiation Society recommended that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a one-line test tool for diagnosing COVID-19." Initial screening 3 March 2020 CDC recommended use
Part of the immune response to infection is resistance, including IGM and IgG.
These antigens can be used to detect individual infections around 7 days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immunization status of the monitored population. They can be measured at the central laboratory (CLT) or through instant testing (PoCT).
These measurements can be performed in many clinical laboratories with high-throughput automated systems, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by serial samples, it is usually measured using an exterior blood sample.
For PoCT, a blood sample is generally obtained using skin piercing.
This is different from the PCR method prior to determination. On 26 March 2020, FDA approved testing methods for 29 entities that are now able to distribute their anti-medical test kits.
As of 7 April 2020, FDA had approved only one test under the emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Epitope Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics test kits were approved for tests.
Hundreds of samples can be detected within a few hours of detection capacity, so that the rate of detection of the virus RNA is much faster than that of the traditional PCR.
Generally, resistance can be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom found that none of the anti-medical test kits it purchased were of sufficient good use.
Hong Kong has put in place a mechanism to prevent suspected patients from living in their homes. "Emergency rooms provide them with sample tubes," patients must pass through the tube and send the tube back to the home at a later stage.
The Vehicle Exemption Testing Centre has helped Korea to conduct faster and widest testing than other countries. In Germany, on 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Doctors indicated that non-hospitalized institutions were able. The previous week
In the case of testing at the request of a doctor, the cost is borne by health insurance.
The Director of the Robert Koch Institute of Germany indicated that Germany had a total detection capacity of 160,000 per week.
As of 19 March, car-free testing had been provided in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only the number of positive tests was reported.
A preliminary 10,000 laboratory survey showed that by 2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples (including 12 weeks of 2020) had been tested "at least 12 weeks" and only 33,491 samples were tested (6.9%).
The laboratory, which was constructed 5 days under the supervision of the Greater Gome Founder, showed a 47 per cent increase in the cases in Hubei and a doubling of the corresponding costs of treatment segregation, if not.
Following the Wuhan Laboratory, the Fire Laboratory was established immediately after Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, and currently has 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, laboratory test daily flux totals 50,000 per day. Origami Assays release source, multicircuit design, which is self-tested through 93 tests, can be performed with multiple dars 1122 patient samples
By March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had been an obstacle to large-scale testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led a number of sponsors to explore sample preparation programmes involving the heating of samples to 98 Â° C (208 Â° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced more testing on 31 March
This capacity has been achieved through the use of decommissioning (Drive-pass) tests, on the one hand, and the funding provided to groups 42 and China (based on their Fire Emergency Testing Laboratory).
The laboratory, which was constructed within 14 days and is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PC tests per day, is the first laboratory of this size in the world to operate outside China.
Different testing methods have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States for various components of the coronary virus genetic spectrum.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test kits by sending test boxes to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own test kits.
The German approach was published on 17 January 2020; the programme developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not be used later than 28 months, limiting United States detection capabilities. China and the United States encountered inadequate testing,
In contrast, extensive testing in the Republic of Korea was seen by experts as useful in reducing the spread of new coronary viruses.
Thanks to the detection capacity established by the Korean Government over the past few years, its main focus has been on laboratories in the private sector.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for additional testing programmes as the best way to mitigate COVID-19 epidemiological development. Widespread transmission of the virus led to high demand for testing, resulting in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test box.
In the United States, test kits developed by CDC contained "defects"; subsequently, the Government removed bureaucratic barriers to private laboratory testing. Spain did not purchase test boxes from the Chinese company Shenzhen Biotechnology.
It explained that the inaccuracy of the results of the tests could be the result of the incorrect collection of samples or the incorrect use of test agent boxes.
The Spanish Cabinet indicated that the test box to recover the erroneous results would be replaced with another test box provided by Shenzhen Bioton. The Czech Republic did not find it correct to purchase 80 per cent of test boxes.
Prime Minister MatoviÄ suggested that the test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. The Turkish Ministry of Health Atek Kara stated that the test cartridges purchased by Turkey from China were "incorrectly tested."
Testing and segregation of those who tested positive and tracking the exposure history of SARS-CoV-2 positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vos (Italy's first COVID-19 place of death) conducted two rounds of testing for a total of approximately 3,400 people, each lasting about 10 days.
About half of them had tested positive and had no symptoms, and all the cases found had been isolated.
By imposing travel restrictions on communities, new infections have been completely eliminated.
Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restricted travel, testing and isolation, 2020 coronary virus transmission in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries / regions, and Singapore has not introduced extreme restrictions, such as mandatory closure of restaurants.
In Singapore, many activities were cancelled and residents were advised to stay at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened on time after the holiday period of 23 March.
Several other countries / areas, such as Ireland and the Republic of Korea, have also contained large-scale outbreaks of disease through large-scale tracking of contacts, restricted travel, detection and isolation, and less radical closure measures.
A statistical study found that the higher the number of cases tested compared to the number of deaths, the lower the case mortality rate, possibly due to the better ability of those countries to detect only mild symptoms or symptoms.
Who Recommended that countries with no detection capacity and limited national laboratory processing COVID-19 experience send one of their top five positive and top 10 negative COVID-19 samples for validation in one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the graph below, "Testing positive%" is influenced by the national testing policy of the country in question.
In other cases with the same conditions, the positive detection rate is higher in countries where only hospitalized persons are detected, as compared to those where all citizens (whether or not symptoms are detected).
There was a rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
In EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) shows similar trends, confirming that while different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 epidemic.
According to the Italian experience, the State, hospitals and psychiatric wards need to be better prepared to cope with the surge of COVID-19, which is particularly important.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were reported in the city of Vukhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 September 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported that pathogens were a new coronary virus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronus 2 (Severe Acute Coavius).
Since then, diseases caused by infections in SARS-CoV-2 have been named coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that about 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases are minor, that is, respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most can be recovered.
Of the approximately 14 per cent of cases, COVID-19 will progress in terms of severe illness and need for hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent will progress in critical condition and need to be re-cared for.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is about 4 per cent.
In this study, we assessed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the European Union / European Economic Area (European Union, EU / European Economic Area, EEA), as well as in the United Kingdom (UK).
We also compare the number of current COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
EU / EEA National and British COVID-19 Cases
Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic are now similar to those of China in other parts of the world.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the European Surveillance magazine published on 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first COVID-19 cases in Europe based on the WHO definition of cases.
In EU / EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on 24 January 2020, involving naturalized persons in the city of Vukhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, all 30 EU / EEA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, had detected COVID-19 cases, of which between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2012, 7 were reported.
Access to COVID-19 cumulative quantity and incidence
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the reported COVID-19 cases from each country worldwide at 8 a.m. each day and is obtained only through official sources such as national health ministries, national and regional health authorities.
These data have been used to assess trends in EU / EEA and UK COVID-19 and to compare them with Italy.
We calculated a 14-day cumulative incidence rate for each EU / EEA country and the UK COVID-19 case between 1 January and 15 March 2020 to be considered as activity COVID-19
We also provided the total number of reported cumulative cases for each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8.00 a.m. and compared with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
EU / EEA Country and British COVID-19 Trends
The trend in the EU / EEA country and the UK's COVID-19 case 14-day cumulative incidence is generally consistent with that of the Province of Hubei (China) (figure 1).
For EU / EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased since around 21 February 2020 and then dramatically around 28 days (supplementary material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but similar increases are observed in all other EU / EEA countries as well as in the UK COVID-19 cumulative morbidity (supplementary information).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 and compares them with Italy.
It should be emphasized that as of 15 March, at 8.00 a.m., 15 other EU / EEA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, have reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy in less than 3 weeks.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported by EU / EEA and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly.
Observed COVID-19 cumulative morbidity trends indicate that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although different countries are at different stages of their public health responses, countries may have different definitions of cases and options for selecting patients subject to COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including supplementary testing, vary, but the situation is the same.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, while media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care wards in those areas had reached maximum capacity.
At the EU / EEA level, only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of COVID-19 cases are currently available for hospitalization and / or access to intensive care wards, respectively (data are not available).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of places in custody and medium-term care available in European countries varied considerably, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal for every 10,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive custody and medium-term care beds per 10,000 people in 2010-2011).
ECDC's sixth update of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment modelled on health-care saturation and related landscape and assessed the relationship between each EU / EEA country and United Kingdom residential COVID-19 patients;
Since cases have so far been concentrated in EU / EEA countries and in certain regions of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care wards usually serve the population covered by the identified areas, it would be preferable to provide information at the standard geographical unit. "NUTS-2
The Italian experience and current trends in other countries indicate that the EU / EEA and the British COVID-19 pandemic are developing rapidly.
The State, hospitals and intensive care wards should therefore be prepared to respond to the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of people in need of health care, especially COVID-19, in Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, rapid, positive and comprehensive approaches are critical to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and require a transition from containment to mitigation, as early decision makers and hospital
The rapid risk assessment also identified public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity through which countries may further strengthen controls to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, health-care systems in other EU / EEA countries are likely to face a surge in the number of people in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Source of co-disease among human animals with human coronary virus
For thousands of years, mutuality and adaptability have been driving the common evolution of coronavirus, CoV and its host (including human beings).
Until 2003, two human coronies (HCoV) were known to cause minor diseases, such as general influenza.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) reversed the situation.
SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in central China at the end of 2019, once again placed CoV at the centre of concern, surprising that it was very sexually transmitted compared to its sister virus SARS-CoV.
As HCoV infection is a common animal disease, it would be useful to know the origins of HCoV's co-disease.
Most HCoV originates from bats and are non-pathogenic.
The owner of some HCoV intermediate storage is also known.
Identification of animal hostels is directly relevant to the prevention of human diseases.
Research into the interaction of CoV hosts in animals may also provide a deeper understanding of human CoV morbidity mechanisms.
In this overview, we provide an overview of the knowledge available in seven HCoV categories, highlighting their discovery history, the origins of co-disease in humans and animals and the intergenerational transmission.
Importantly, we have compared and compared different HCoV from the point of view of the evolution of the virus and the restructuring of the genome.
In this context, we have explored the current epidemic of the 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, the paper focuses on the requirements for successful host conversion and the impact of virus penetration on the severity of the disease.
CoV is part of the coronary virus section and consists of a group of justice blanket chains RNA viruses.
These viruses contain the largest genome in the RNA virus, with 2.6 to 3.2 million alkali, and are referred to as the "coronary virus" (CoV) for presentation of coronary form under an electronic mirror.
Structurally, CoV has a non-subset genome that shares similar organizations.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b) that have been translated into pp1a and pp1ab for replication of enzyme polyprotein.
These multi-polar proteins were further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1 ~ 16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORF for structural proteins, including irritation (S), film (E), film (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Many auxiliary proteins of spectrum heterogeneity are also coV coded by different spectral systems.
According to differences in protein series, CoV is divided into four parts (al- CoV, beta-CoV, gamme-CoV and Delhi-CoV), of which beta-CoV comprises the majority.
System development evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic sources of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main hostels of gamma-CoV and Delhi-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
To date, 7 infections are known to be coronary virus (HCoV).
Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alCoV.
Other 5 species, beta-CoV, including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, Middle East RS-CoV (SARS-CoV).
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually give rise to minor symptoms such as common feelings and / or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, leading to severe lower respiratory infections among a relatively larger number of patients and are more likely to acute
20 Century In mid-1960s, the first HCoV-229E strains B814 were separated from the nose endocrine of common influenza patients.
Since then, human beings have gained more knowledge through extensive research on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which can give rise to both self-critical symptoms.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of SARS, the concept of infection HCoV, usually innocent, was widely accepted.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude death rate of about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, following the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.
2019 New HCoVviruses (2019-nCoV, later known as SARS-CoV-2) are the continuing 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) multiple days, 2020.
The alarm has begun and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All 7 HCoV have a common source of disease in human animals from bats, rats or domestic animals.
There is a variety of evidence that all HCoV penetration originates from bats, where the virus is well adaptable and non-pathogenic but exhibits great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic poses enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world as a whole.
Tracking the origins of HCoV's co-infection in human animals provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and constraints of the leapfrogging of viruses.
In addition, it will guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 depositors, middlemen and extended animal dormitories, which will be important in preventing future spillovers of the virus.
In this overview, we provide an overview of the co-incidence, inter-plant transmission and morbidity mechanisms of HCoV's human animals.
In particular, we have highlighted and explored a common theme that HCoV's intimate viruses are not usually pathogenic in its natural receptacle, but are pathogenic when transmitted across species to the new host.
In addition, we recall the trend towards the evolution of HCoV, where increased portability is often accompanied by reduced morbidity.
In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Animals CoV has been widely known since the end of the twentieth century.
Prior to the first separation of HCoV-229E strains B814 from the nasal endocrine of common influenza patients, the physicians were already in various affected fauna (including chickens, rats.
Over the past few decades, 7 HCoV have been detected.
A brief chronological summary of the history of HCoV discoveries (table 1) would provide us with rich information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E virus strains were separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections and subsequently grown in Wi-38 lung-cell strains.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E suffer from common feeling symptoms such as headaches, spraying, discomfort, throat, and 10 - 20% from hot, cough and other symptoms.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from organs development in the mice brain and subsequent successive generations.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to HCoV-229E infections, with no significant differences in symptoms compared to other respiratory pathogens such as the influenza virus and nose.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in the winter of the temperate climate.
As a rule, the two viruses have less than one week of latency, followed by approximately 2 weeks of illness.
A study of human volunteers shows that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E may experience moderate general influenza.
Only a few patients with low immune capacity exhibit severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," is the first well-documented epidemic in human history caused by HCoV, whose pathogens are SARS-CoV, the third found HCoV.
The first case, SARS, dates back to the late 2002 province of Guangdong, China.
The outbreak in SARS resulted in 8,096 reported cases, 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.
With the exception of super-transmitters, it is estimated that each case may result in some 2 subsequent cases, with a probation period of 4 to 7 days and a 10-day high in the load of the virus.
Infections SARS-CoV patients began with muscle pain, headaches, heat, discomfort and cold war, followed by later symptoms such as respiratory distress, cough and respiratory distress.
The reduction of lymphocytes, liver screening anomalies and the rise in muscle acid laser enzyme are common laboratory checks in SARS.
In addition, corrosive pneumatic foam damage, leather cell propagation and increased infiltration cells were observed among SARS patients.
Some 20-30 per cent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal, liver and kidney, are also likely to be infected and are usually associated with cell storms, which may be fatal among patients with low immunology.
The virus was first separated from an open lung test of a relative from a source patient who travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there has been a commitment to the HCoV study.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent among young children, the elderly and those suffering from respiratory diseases.
Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, nasal, meningitis, fever and bronchitis are common.
Another independent study showed that the same virus had been separated from the nasal slogans of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, in practice it is distributed globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with a peak in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive pneumonia (also known as Grophoritis).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community access to sexual pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with acute asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four communities have been well adapted to humans and are often less likely to cause highly pathogenic diseases as a result of mutagenic changes. There are also accidental and unknown causes such as HV CoV-N
Typically, these HCoV are less toxic or pathogenic when they acquire the capacity for effective transmission and continued survival in the human body.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the pneumonia of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases are reported in European countries and Tunisia, where there are occasional cases of STIs to close contact.
In 2015, there was a resurgence of sexually transmitted infections in Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical performance of MERS is similar to that of SARS and is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have experienced acute kidney failure, a characteristic characteristic of the disease that has so far been caused by HCoV.
More than 30 per cent of patients suffer from gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases and a high death rate of 34.4 per cent were reported from laboratories, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In late December 2019, concentrated pneumonia was found in the city of Vukhan, Hubei Province, China, and it was confirmed by retrospective analysis that it was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization declared the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude death rate of 3.4 per cent.
It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2 per cent, compared with 1.2 per cent in areas other than Lake North.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe respiratory infections in the form of fever, cough and respiratory difficulties.
Some patients also suffer from diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms that can rapidly develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the homogeneity of 82 per cent of the denotide serial series, they are clustered into different branches in system development trees.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are significantly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV-2 but more infectious.
The reported emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to accelerate the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
By comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other 6 HCoV, we can discover very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the probability and duration of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trends of other 6 HCoV categories.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms ranges from SARS-CoV to 4 communities HCoV (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HV-1
On the one hand, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in community access to HCoV infections, including non-heterogeneous, light or even symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infections, albeit at a slightly lower rate.
Third, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of community access HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as community accessibility HCoV.
On the other hand, it remains to be tested whether SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will decline after human transmission.
Finally, as with other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in excreta samples.
At least in some cases, the mass-oral dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, which plays an important role as in SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified in future studies.
It is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community access HCoV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, transmission, morbidity and continuous transmission after generations will have important implications for the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All 4 communities with mild symptoms HCoV have been well adapted to humanity.
From another perspective, humankind has also well adapted to these 4 HCoV species.
In other words, both may be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoV, who causes serious human diseases, and those suffering from HCoV diseases have all died.
To this end, HCoV must undergo adequate replication in humans in order to accumulate adaptive surges in order to counter host constraints.
In this sense, the longer the epidemic continues, the greater the number of people infected, the greater the likelihood that it will be fully adapted to humanity.
If it is well adapted, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four of these communities have acquired sexual coronary viruses that have spread among the population, leading to common influenza among people with normal immune functions.
These viruses do not require animal hostels.
In contrast, high pathogenicity SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to human beings and cannot be transmitted continuously in humans.
They need to sustain and reproduce among paediatric dormitories and may find opportunities to spread to vulnerable populations through one or more middlemen and extended hostels.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to those of SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and 4 community access HCoV.
It is as highly infectious as community access HCoV, at least at present.
However, it is more pathogenic than community access to sexual HCoV, and lower than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to humanity and circulates within humans in the absence of dormitories or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV's animal, the definition and characteristics of the intake, natural, storekeeper, middleman and expanded hostel of HCoV are of some guidance to us.
If an animal has a closely related ancestral heterogeneity at the denotide sequence level, the animal will become the intricate hostel of HCoV.
The ancestral virus is usually highly adaptable and non-pathogenic in the host.
Similarly, storage owners will carry HCoV on a permanent and continuous basis.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its viruses.
By contrast, if HCoV has just been placed in the middleman or immediately in the body, it will not be well adapted to the new hostel and will usually be pathological.
Such dormitories can serve as a source of co-infection among human beings and serve as hostels by allowing the virus to be replicated briefly and then transmitted to humans to scale up human infections.
If HCoV is unable to maintain its transmission within the middleman, end-of-life infections may occur.
On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt to middlemen or even create long-term localities.
In such cases, the middleman becomes the natural receptacle.
Epidemiological data retrospective analysis found that SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals in indexing cases.
Subsequent seropositive surveys show higher levels of immune proteg (IgG) in animal vendors against SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
In the living animal market, orchards and a cal were found for the first time to be almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus SARS-CoV sample virus.
This view is indirectly supported by the fact that there is no further SARS report after removing all the fruits from the market.
However, it was reported that the testing of SARS-CoV was largely negative in the wild or unexposed farm fruit market, which suggests that it may be only the middleman hostel and not SARS Co.
Notably, since 80 per cent of the different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV resistance, it cannot be excluded that a wide range of small mammals may also serve as hosts in SARS.
All of these animals appear to be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent study of the SARS-CoV natural animal hostel found a closely related bats coronary virus known as SARS-related pyredron virus HKU3 (SARSr-RBatV).
These bats are positive to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bats coronary viruses are homogenous to SARS-CoV with 88-92 per cent serial serial denotide.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept of bats as hostels of emerging human pathogens.
In addition, researchers have identified multiple SARS coronary viruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but with the exception of one designated WIV1, none of the viruses can be separated as live viruses.
Human cardiovascular stress conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2) are known to be SARS-CoV recipients.
WIV1, extracted from bats faecal samples, has been shown to use bats, fruits and human ACE2 as its admissions to the cell.
Interestingly, SARS is able to moderate the serum and WIV1 among patients in the recovery period.
To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestors to bats SARS-CoV, with 95 per cent of the serial homogeneity of nucleotide.
Although the two viruses are highly homogeneous, WIV1 is generally not considered to be a direct kinship virus of SARS-CoV, nor is the bats the direct collector of SARS-CoV.
The systematic development analysis classifies MERS-CoV as the same group as Bats CoV-HKU4 and Bats CoV-HKU5.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV invaded the virus with the same host of diphetaminated herpid enzyme 4 (DPP4).
RNA dependency RNA polyenzyme sequences in MERS-CoV are more close to RNA in system development than in bats and beta-CoV from Europe and Africa.
To date, MERS-CoV has not been found alive in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close bats CoV-HKU25 have only 87 per cent serial homogeneity of nucleion.
Therefore, bats may not be direct depositories of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single jockeys are seropositive to MERS-CoV heterogeneity and antibody blood, similar to camels originating in the Middle East.
The work separated from the nose of a single camel MERS-CoV is the same as the virus found in the body, which further demonstrates that camels are the true hostel of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that in the camels of the experimental infection MERS-CoV, the general symptoms were minor, but a large number of viruses were observed to have dropped.
It is worth noting that infected camels transmit the virus not only through respiratory channels but also through septic channels, which are also the main means of spreading the virus to bats.
However, problems remain, as many of the confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camel prior to symptoms, which may be attributed to artificial or unknown channels of transmission, including unidentified species MERS Co.
SARS-CoV-2 Bats CoV RaTG13, separated from the pyrethyroids, have 96.2 per cent nucleate acid homogeneity.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to determine kinship relationships.
In other words, the bats may not be the direct receptacle of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bats are found in the future.
It is assumed that many of the first COVID-19 cases of wild species sold and slaughtered by SARS-CoV-2 dormitories at the wholesale market in the South China Sea are relevant.
Recent studies based on macro-genome sequencing have shown that a endangered small mammals known as wearing mountains (Malay worms) may also carry ancestral beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV.
These new isotopic viruses genomes are homogenous to SARS-CoV-2 with 85-92 per cent serial serial densification.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with about 90 per cent homogeneity at the serial level of nucleotide.
In system development trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 sample virus subsystems, one of which is more similar to SARS-CoV-2 with a base serum of 97.4 per cent.
In contrast, the RBD differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are greater, although they are more homogenous to the entire genome.
An earlier study on pneumonia also reported an overlap of viruses detected from lung samples, with results similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Using different assembly methods and manual processing, the study obtained some of the genome sequence of approximately 86.3 per cent of the entire genome of the virus.
We cannot rule out the possibility that mountains are one of the stomach hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from mountains due to differences in the sequence of beta-CoV associated with the wearing of mountains SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 associated with impressions.
SARS-CoV-2 pathway in bats, mountains and other mammals remains to be determined.
Although the highest sequential homogeneity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and mountain alloys, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2.
It is highly assumed that the high similarity between penetrating SARS-CoV-2 related to beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD is fuelled by selective convergences.
Another contrary view is that beta-CoV and RaTG13, associated with mountainous SARS-CoV-2, have been reorganized in the third wildlife species.
As a driving force for evolution, reorganization is widespread in beta-CoV.
The source of direct human and animal co-disease at SARS-CoV-2 is not yet determined.
In addition to high pathogenic HCoV, researchers studied HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1
Systematic developmental evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bats coronary virus, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1
It is reported that the bats' coronary virus found in three North American bats, known as Appalachian Ridge CoV, shows that it is closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has genetic links with another bats coronary virus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008), of which camel animals are suspected.
For clarity purposes, figures 1 and 2 summarize existing knowledge of known animal origins of HCoV.
Systematic development analysis provides evidence of historical episodes of intermittent transmission in HCoV.
After 1890, when HCoV-OC43 transgendered from livestock to humans, there was a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases.
The history of inter-ethnic transmission of HCoV-229E is not yet known.
Bats alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HCoV-229E, has been found.
Between the two, a grain alpha-CoV emerged.
There is multiple evidence to support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, rather than goats, may be exposed to bats in a common ecological position.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with sheep camels.
Secondly, bats alpha-CoV associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV causes respiratory outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV was not found in wildlife.
Therefore, the possibility of obtaining HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from human sources cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nepa virus and the Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, although bats alCoV serves as a gene bank for HCoV-229E, sheep camels and pockeys may be intermediate hosts of transmission of the virus to humans, exactly the same.
MERS-CoV is a good illustration of the spread from bats to single jockeys and from single pockeys to human species.
The source of the penetration of the Bats MERS-CoV was known in its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries reinforced this argument.
It is clear that bats provide a rich reservoir of viruses for interplant exchange and inter-plant transmission of gene tablets.
Long-lived and intensive groups, strong social interaction and strong flight capabilities are all favourable conditions for bats to become ideal "virus transmitters."
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in a single cap for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have also been transformed from intermediate hostels to stable natural receptacles.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains a relatively low volatility rate.
It is an accident to the sporadic spread of human beings, who are still the end-occupants of MERS-CoV because it cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the dissemination of MERS-CoV, the role of mountains in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, if any, is different.
In particular, the wearing of mountain a beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in mountains.
They may be SARS-CoV-2 associated end-occupants of beta-CoV similar to those in SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission from animals to human species must be identified or excluded in future studies.
In the first place, bats may be the custodian of SARS-CoV-2 viruses almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share ecological positions with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, mountainous worming may be one of the middlemen of the new invasions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Human beings are infected with the virus through slaughter and the consumption of wild tastes.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for antibiotic surveys of livestock and wildlife.
Thirdly, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be reorganized and adapted in the third species that have been exposed to bats and mountains.
Research continues on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the different types of animal hostels, the three main elements of the virus also play an important role in promoting coronary viruses across interplant barriers.
First, they have a high volatility rate in RNA replication.
In comparison to other single chains RNA viruses, the probability of coronary virus mutation is estimated to be "medium" to "high," with an average replacement rate of about 10 per year for new dormitories
The decontamination of coronary viruses with prophylactic nucleate spraying can lead to very high variability and decline, or even survival.
Interestingly, the known nucleotide analogy, Remaivir, can inhibit coronary virus replication by suppressing this nucleate spillover enzyme and RNA dependence RNA.
Redsey is one of the most promising resistant drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the coronary virus is about 100,000 times more volatile than its host.
Moreover, if the coronary virus is not well adapted to the host, it is usually very high.
SARS-CoV is significantly lower than SARS-CoV-2, which has a high volatility rate, indicating that it is more adaptable to humans.
It can be assumed that it has adapted to another host close to humanity.
Apart from SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a single cap.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to result in the rapid neutralization of vaccines and antiretrovirals targeted at SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger coronary virus RNA genome has additional plastic properties in genetic mutations and reconfigurations, thus increasing the potential for inter-plant synergy, which facilitates the emergence of new coronary viruses.
This is evidenced by the large number of unique open-reading boxes and protein functions that are coded towards the genome 3 'end-of-end code.
Third, in RNA replication, coronary viruses switch templates randomly and frequently through unique "replication options" mechanisms.
In hostels that are commingled packagings, chain exchanges are frequent during the transcription process.
The entire population of highly homogeneous sources and the subgenome RNA can be reorganized to produce new coronary viruses.
Evidence of the development of natural regroupment systems has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in bats SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Transmission-related virus-host interactions
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, the interaction between the virus and host receptors is another key factor affecting transmission between species.
A case in point is the reorganization of SARS-CoV, which shows evidence of a positive choice in the case of episodes of transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis of the separated strains of man and fruit tape SARS-CoV, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can adapt quickly to different hostels, particularly through the mutation of S proteRBD.
Typically, RBD in coronary virus S protein interacts with cell receptors and is closely screened for host resistance.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318 to 510 ammonia acid in the S1 section, which is integrated with the human ACE2 and its co-receptors to enable the virus to enter.
RBD in SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 recipients of various animals, including bats, fruits, rats and mal, so that the virus can spread across species.
In fact, in RBD, only six different ammonium acid residues were observed, including four in the sequence of interacting receptors with the ACE2 receptor, separate from the human and fruit virus.
The presence of K479N and S487T mutations in RBD of SARS-CoV may increase the likelihood of fibre protein interacting with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two ammonia acids may be essential for the adaptation of the virus to human beings.
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell bodies as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S protein S1 means that the association and strength of S protein with human ACE2 may change.
Indeed, a cold telescope study shows that the relative strength of this combination is 10 to 20 times higher than that of the man ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be useful to determine whether any other co-receptors were needed in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also combined with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E ammonide phetaminated enzymes N and HCoV-OC43 9-O-ethyl.
They may also explain why the coronary virus has successfully adapted to humanity after spreading across species from animal hostels.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of the spread of the HCoV species are also influenced by other host dependency and restrictive factors.
Differences in these staple proteins between humans and bats, single camels and rodents HCoV natural hostels may constitute barriers to intergenerational transmission.
HCoV Successful intergenerational transmission can only be achieved by depriving the host of the dependency factor and breaking the host's constraints.
In this regard, the molecular determinants of the important field of HIV-host interaction have yet to be identified and identified.
The use of the latest CRISPR technique for an impartial whole genome screening of SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and restrictive factors is likely to yield results.
The emergence of a new type of HCoV: Back to its origin
The diversity of bats' coronary virus offers ample opportunity for the emergence of a new type of HCoV.
In this sense, bats' coronary virus serves as a gene bank for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic regroupment are drivers of HCoV evolution and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coded genes could radically change the shape of the virus.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 was considered important for human adaptation because it separated SARS-CoV-related bats but found that they could be coded differently by ORF8 proteins.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 NRN missing features of SARS-CoV were found in separated strains of viruses.
This absence divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation to facilitate host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have been reorganized with the al- and gamma-CoV spectrum, where a large number of smaller reorganization areas have been identified in RNA dependency RNA polymer enzymes.
Relocations were also found in nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the prevalence of MERS-CoV has experienced an inter-spectral reorganization, which took place in a single camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganization incidents were observed in other HCoV, where HCoV and other animal coronies were reorganized in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial choices may lead to accidental changes in the virus genome, probably due to reduced pressure on options such as host immune systems to which the virus is exposed.
An example of these roles is that, in the HCoV-229E prototype virus strains, the absence of dual nucleotide acid has led to the absence of a full-time ORF4.
Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV shows the insertion of individual nucleaciers, causing a drastic change.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by pressure from the storekeeper's choice.
After bats were infected with the coronary virus, no symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected, indicating that coronary viruses and bats were adapted to each other.
Bats appear to be well adapted to coronary viruses from an anomaly and physiological point of view.
For example, bats' inflammatory flaws have been effective in reducing pathological changes caused by coronary viruses.
In addition, bats' natural injury cell activities are inhibited by the ongoing regulation of depressive NKG2 / CD94 and the low level of molecular expression of the main tissues, Class I.
Moreover, high-level active oxygen (Ros) generated by high metabolism in bats can contain the replication of coronary viruses and can provide high pressure for exposure to new dormitories.
More pathogenic coronary strains may also be transformed through reorganization, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to accommodate hostels.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new models have emerged in the past two decades.
The coronary virus does not cause disease or mild symptoms in hostels such as bats and camels.
They are heavily replicable and do not engender a strong host immune response.
That is why there are symptoms and cases of serious human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the excessive activation of the immune response and cell storms, the greater the immune response and the greater the lung damage.
In contrast, among those with symptoms, the immune response has been removed from the coronary virus replication.
The same strategy to link the immune response may have a positive impact in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The disturbance reaction in bats was particularly strong.
Therefore, the use of type I jamming elements at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection should be useful.
In addition, the pneumatic activity of NLRP3 in bats is flawed.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 depression NLRP3 hepatitis may be useful for COVID-19 treatment.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general themes on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were created.
Although 95 per cent of the congeners with SARS-CoV have been found to be bats beta-CoV, there is a bat coronary virus with SARS-CoV-2 as high as 96.
While fruits and other animals in the market have been found to have the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct middleman of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified.
Mountainous beta-CoV, which is clearly associated with SARS-CoV-2, has been found to indicate that it may be one of the median hosts, or that it has contributed to the final version. SARS
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentional or unintentional.
As a result of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the coronary virus has re-emerged as a focus of attention.
Research on the coronary virus in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the origins of HCoV co-disease and the importance of animal dormitories in human transmission.
There is considerable evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humanity through middlemen.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the exposure of humans to the fruit market on the market, closing the wet cargo market and killing the fruit market can effectively put an end to the prevalence of SARS.
Similarly, in view of the discovery of multiple spectrum bands that wear mountains, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, mountainous alpha should be removed from the wet cargo market in order to prevent.
However, further research remains to be done on whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through mountains and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed for a long time in a single cap.
These camels are important means of transport and are the main source of meat, milk, leather and straight-line products for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to follow the practice of the China Wildlife Market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by sacrificing all camels in order to control MERS.
In order to stop the resurgence of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camel, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
As we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genes may emerge, leading to outbreaks.
A variety of human and animal-borne coronary viruses are circulating in wildlife environments.
In particular, bats with potential for co-infection in human animals are highly diverse.
There are many opportunities for the evolution and restructuring of the coronary virus, which is common to these animals, thus making it easier for future new coronies to spread and / or fatal in human beings.
In some parts of China, the culture of consumption of wildlife should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the critical tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better prevention and response plans.
Indeed, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.
They remain in their natural hostels until spillover opportunities arise.
Although bats have many characteristics conducive to transmission of the virus, human exposure to bats and other wildlife species can be significantly reduced if people are educated away from bats and other wildlife species.
In order to better understand the ecological status of coronary viruses and their natural hostels, continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary and will prove useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
In sum, the most effective way to prevent the co-infection of viral animals is for humans to stay far from the ecology of the natural habitants of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 also suffers from several deficiencies in the origins of co-infection in human animals.
First, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to mountains, it would be useful to examine under what circumstances the same ecological position could be shared between bats and mountains.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human communication, how humans are exposed to bats remains to be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammalian acts as a genuine median, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and mountains.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection studies should be conducted.
In the case of bats, drones or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be found in the natural hostel in the future, or almost identical to it.
Continuing research in this area will reveal SARS-CoV-2 pathways to penetration in animals, which are important for human COVID-19 prevention and control.
