Report on the results of parallel checks on the management of value added tax between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out in 2005
Introduction Word
The material presented reports on the progress and results of parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší kontrolní úradom Slovenskej republiky, which focused on the field of value added tax administration and the use of the VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).
In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so that the revenue from value added tax affects not only the national budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.
Parallel control actions were aimed, in particular, at checking the tax authorities' process for examining the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions between individual Member States of the European Union.
The introduction of VIES made it possible to exchange information electronically on the registration of value added tax payers in the various Member States of the European Union and on commercial transactions carried out by those payers.
The discrepancy between the VIES data and the data in the taxpayer's VAT return should alert the tax authorities to suspicious cases and allow tax evasion or fraud to be detected.
The benefits of the parallel checks carried out were not only in the exchange of information on the procedure followed by the financial and tax authorities in the administration of value added tax, but in particular in the examination of the use of the VIES system in checking the application of the right to value added tax exemption in intra-Community transactions.
The knowledge gained from the implementation of parallel controls is beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used to carry out further parallel controls in cooperation with the control institutions of the Member States of the European Union.
Report on the results of parallel controls on the administration of value added tax for the period 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005
Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005
Subject: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration, (SK) Control of the tax authorities' procedures for the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and the performance of VIES tasks for the exchange of information between EU Member States
The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO, the Czech Republic) and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky (hereinafter referred to as the SAO of the Slovak Republic) concluded a contract on cooperation in auditing activities on 12 September 2005.
The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implementation of parallel auditing actions “Value Added Tax Administration”, included in the SAO, Czech Republic's 2005 audit work plan under No 05/19, and “Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and recovery of taxes on prized value and fulfilment of roles under the VIES system on the deletion of informácii medzi by the members of ECA”, included in the SAO's audit work plan under No 22/2005.
The control actions carried out in parallel were in the nature of coordinated control.
The result of the joint coordinated inspection has been processed within the meaning of the European Enforcement Regulation No 31 on INTOSAI control standards.
The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract and producing a joint final report on the outcome of the parallel checks.
The purpose of the coordinated inspection was to verify selected cases of supply and acquisition of goods in suspicious commercial transactions between taxpayers of value added tax from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the ‘SR’).
Both parties contractually undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the VIES electronic system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on requests received and sent to examine commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
The checks were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the control was carried out by the state budget department and territorial departments of central Bohemia, northwestern Bohemia, southern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.
The audited persons were the Ministry of Finance and 12 Financial Offices: the Tax Office in Mlada Boleslav, the Tax Office in Kolín, the Tax Office in Teplice, the Financial Office in Karlovy Vary, the Financial Office in Tábor, the Financial Office in Brno III, the Tax Office in Znojma, the Financial Office in Zlín, the Financial Office in Šumperk, the Financial Office in Ostrava I, the Financial Office for Prague 7 and the Financial Office for Prague 9.
The audit was carried out in the territory of SR by the Finance and Tax Division of the SAO of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the SAO Expozituras of Banská Bystrica and Košice on 9 selected tax offices: Bratislava I, Komárno Tax Office, Trenčín Tax Office, Prievidza Daňový úrad, Zvolen Daňový úrad, Dolný Kubín Daňový úrad, Košice II Daňový úrad, Košice V and Michalovce Daňový úrad.
Objective of inspections:
The aim of the parallel control actions was to examine the procedure of the financial and/or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (VAT) following the incorporation of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (EU) and to examine the use of the VIES electronic information system, in particular when checking the application of the right to VAT exemption.
The audited period of the coordinated inspection was the period from 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions An electronic VIES system is in place in EU Member States, allowing tax authorities to check whether a supplier has been authorised to exempt a taxable transaction from VAT and, in the country of destination, to check whether the purchaser has properly declared and taxed the goods acquired.
VIES is not centralised within the EU, each Member State develops its own system.
The audit found differences in the national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the following areas:
The recapitulative statements indicate the values of supplies of goods to other EU Member States, the values of services provided are not included in recapitulative statements.
Data from summary reports filed by Czech payers are processed at the level of tax authorities in the Czech Republic, where they are compared with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States included in VAT returns.
The tax authorities transmit the data from the recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to the other EU Member States.
In SR, data from recapitulative statements filed by Slovak taxpayers at tax offices are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of SR (CLO).
In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of supplies of goods and services to other EU Member States on separate lines of VAT returns, which makes it possible to compare the values reported in the recapitulative statements with the values of supplies of goods according to VAT tax returns and to identify any differences between them.
In SR, the values of goods and services supplied to other EU Member States are reported cumulatively on a common line of VAT return.
As a result, in SR, the system does not make it possible to automatically identify differences between the values of supplies of goods according to VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
Separate reporting of goods delivery values in VAT returns allows the results of data reconciliation to be used in controlling VAT exemption of supplies of goods to the EU.
The data received from the recapitulative statements filed by payers in other EU Member States are processed into CLOs and compared with the value of acquisitions of goods declared by payers from the Czech Republic and SR respectively in VAT returns.
In the SR, these data are sent to the tax authorities, and the tax authorities decide for themselves which cases of difference to examine.
In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which quantified differences between the values of delivery and acquisition of goods must be checked by the tax authorities, and gives a list of these cases to the tax authorities responsible locally.
This ensures that, for the most significant derogations, it will be verified that VAT was correctly declared when the goods were acquired.
Furthermore, the audit highlighted some problems in the VAT management system due to the different reporting of intra-Community transactions (i.e. supplies and acquisitions of goods made by payers from different EU Member States):
Summary reports are filed in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum period for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the respective quarter.
Reducing the reporting period of recapitulative statements to one month, together with reducing the processing time, would allow earlier access to VIES data.
Tax authorities would thus be able to check more effectively whether VAT was declared at the correct amount when intra-Community acquisitions were made.
At the same time, the submission of VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same tax year (month) would allow quicker verification of whether the payer has declared in both the recapitulative statement and the VAT return the same value of the supplies of goods to the EU.
Differences between EU-payer declared goods delivery values and those reported by CR and SR payers were due, among other things, to different reporting of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions data across EU Member States.
These were, for example, the presentation in recapitulative statements of advance payments received, or the presentation in a supplier's recapitulative statement of intra-Community supplies in a quarter other than intra-Community acquisitions in the acquirer's VAT return.
The harmonisation of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to streamlining of the control activities of national tax administrations.
The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic was also aimed at examining selected intra-Community transactions carried out between the two states.
A total of 40 cases of commercial transactions between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined together, where there were doubts about their implementation or suspicions of VAT evasion.
The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic have found out the following:
tax entities have declared in their VAT returns for the purpose of unduly obtaining an excess VAT deduction the execution of intra-Community transactions which have not actually been carried out;
Tax Entities reported intra-Community deliveries in carousel transactions, in which there were deliberate multiple decreases in the value of the deliveries in order to draw excessive VAT deductions;
suppliers declared in their VAT returns and recapitulative statements intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to purchasers who were so-called "lost companies" and did not declare the tax on the goods acquired;
the suppliers made an intra-Community supply of VAT-exempt goods to tax entities which were not registered for VAT in another Member State.
In those cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier's country;
suppliers declared intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns at a higher value than the intra-Community acquisitions declared by the acquirers, in some cases with an incorrect amount of VAT declared.
The lessons learned from the audit action showed that VIES provides tax administrations with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.
In particular, tax administrations should pay close attention to rigorously examining the differences between the data reported by VAT payers and the VIES data and using any information in tax proceedings.
Value Added Tax Issues After the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic Join the EU
Value Added Tax
On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic became members of the EU.
Internal borders and border controls on the movement of goods within EU territory have been abolished since EU accession.
Until 30.4.2004, the VAT administrator was the competent financial and tax office, with the exception of the importation of goods and occasional bus services within the country, where the tax authority was the customs office.
In the context of the adoption of the new Act No 235/2004 Coll. on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Act No 235/2004 Coll.") and Act No 222/2004 Col. on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Act No 222/2004 Coll."), the administration of VAT on the acquisition of goods and services (formerly imports) from other EU Member States has shifted from customs offices to financial and tax offices respectively.
The supply of goods in the Czech Republic, according to the provisions of Section 13 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., means the transfer of the right to dispose of goods as owner.
The delivery of goods from the Czech Republic to another EU Member State is the delivery of goods that have actually been dispatched or transported to another EU Member State.
Pursuant to Article 64 of Law 235/2004 Coll., a taxable transaction is exempt with the right to deduct VAT if the goods are supplied to a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.
A supply of goods in SR under the provisions of Article 8 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z. is a supply of tangible property in which the right to property is altered.
The transfer of goods owned by a taxable person from the territory of the country to another Member State shall also be regarded as a supply of goods if those goods are dispatched or transported by that person or on his behalf to another Member State for the purposes of his business.
Pursuant to Article 43 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z., the supply of goods from the national territory to another Member State is exempt from VAT if the purchaser is a person identified for VAT in another Member State.
Acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in the Czech Republic pursuant to Section 16 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. is the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of goods that are dispatched or transported to the customer by a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.
The Czech payer purchases goods at a VAT-free price and is obliged to declare VAT in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of Section 25 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., if he fulfils the conditions of Section 73 of this Act, he is entitled to deduct VAT.
Acquisition of goods domestically from another EU Member State in SR, pursuant to Article 11 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z., means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of movable tangible property dispatched or transported to the person acquiring it by or on behalf of the supplier or the person acquiring it within the country from another Member State.
The SR tax becomes chargeable to the payer when the goods are acquired within the country from another Member State in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of Act No 222/2004 Z.z.
Under Paragraph 49 of Act No 222/2004, the taxpayer may deduct VAT if the tax is charged by him on the acquisition within the country of goods from another Member State in accordance with Paragraphs 11 and 11a of that Act.
Three-digit trade is, according to the provisions of Section 17 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. and/or Section 45 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z., a trade concluded between three persons registered for VAT in three different EU Member States where the object of the trade is the supply of the same goods between the three persons.
Intra-unitary transactions are supplies and acquisitions of goods made between VAT payers from different EU Member States.
The total volumes of intra-Community transactions made between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are shown in the table below.
VIES system
A VAT information exchange system has been set up within the EU to control the exercise of the right to VAT exemption on intra-Community supplies of goods.
It includes the VIES electronic system, which allows EU Member State tax authorities to check whether the supplier has been entitled to exempt the taxable transaction from VAT and vice versa, whether the purchaser has properly declared and taxed the goods acquired.
The VIES information system is not centralised within the EU.
Each Member State develops its own VIES system.
The national systems work on a common principle and are interconnected via a common EU communication network, the Common Communication Network (CCN; see diagram below).
In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was linked to the Automated Tax Information System (‘ADIS’), in the Slovak Republic with the Tax Information System Application Software (‘APV DIS’).
These systems are used by the financial and tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in the management of taxes and charges.
International administrative cooperation
Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU country receives information on tax entities that it would not be able to obtain on its own without such cooperation.
The main objective of international administrative cooperation is to combat tax evasion and tax losses.
Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each Member State establishes a central department within the internal organisational structure in the field of administrative cooperation between EU Member States in the management of VAT, the Central Liaison Office (CLO).
In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance – Central Financial and Tax Directorate, where the International Cooperation in VAT Administration Unit (hereinafter referred to as the MF CLO) has been established, performs the tasks arising from international cooperation.
The function of the CLO in the SR is fulfilled by the Tax Directorate of the SR, the Department of International Administrative Cooperation (DR CLO).
These departments communicate with EU foreign administrations in particular in the area of exchange of information under VIES, exchange of spontaneous information and information at the request of EU tax administrations, coordination of multilateral (simultaneous) tax controls, verification of tax identification numbers (TIN) of persons registered for VAT in other EU Member States and communicate with the European Commission.
In order to examine a particular intra-Community transaction or to obtain further information relating to a particular tax entity, the financial and tax authorities send requests for information to the EU via MF CLO or DR CLO respectively.
Through these requests, they obtain information from the requested Member States which they can use to correctly determine VAT.
Requests for information are sent mostly in electronic form between the CLOs of EU Member States, using the standardised SCAC form.
Selected control findings when verifying business transactions
The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic was mainly aimed at examining selected intra-Community transactions carried out between the two states, as well as the level of use of information obtained through international cooperation by the financial and tax authorities.
The SAO, Czech Republic, requested the SAO SR to verify in 30 cases the business transactions carried out between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.
The SAO requested the SAO of the Czech Republic to verify in 10 cases the business transactions carried out between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.
Examination of intra-Community transactions revealed, inter alia:
o
The SAO, Czech Republic asked the SAO SR to verify the procedure of the tax administration, which was sent a reply to the request for information.
The Slovak Tax Office requested through the SCAC form a verification of the delivery of goods (footwear) in Q3 2004 from a Slovak payer worth 2 847 thousand Sk.
The Tax Office in the Czech Republic replied that the Czech payer had declared the acquisition of the goods at this value only in a supplementary VAT return and had returned the same goods to Slovak tax entities worth CZK 2,550,000 by the end of 2004.
Based on the international cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR, it was found that the tax office of the Slovak supplier has fully recognised the right to an excess VAT deduction arising, inter alia, from this supply.
This tax office did not provide information about the suspected re-export to the tax authorities locally responsible buyers of goods imported back from the Czech payer.
This will provide an impetus for further examination of trading activities in relation to possible carousel fraud.
o
The Czech tax administrator requested through the SCAC form a verification of the delivery of a technology line to SR worth 4,850,000 CZK in the 2nd quarter of 2004.
The tax procedure carried out in SR showed that only part of the technology line was delivered, components worth CZK 3,395,000 were not delivered.
In examining this case, the SAO SR found that the VAT on the taxable transaction carried out was declared by the Slovak taxpayer on the amount of CZK 4 850,000 in the VAT return (DAP) for tax year 7/2004.
The SAO, Czech Republic also found that the Czech payer had reported in his DAP an excess VAT deduction of CZK 655,000 for that quarter, which was generated by the application of a VAT deduction on the purchase of this technology line from another domestic payer.
Based on the results of the investigation, the Czech Tax Office concluded that the Czech and Slovak Tax Entities had formed a business relationship for the purpose of illegally obtaining an excess VAT deduction, disputed the realisation of the taxable transaction and failed to recognise part of the Czech taxpayer's right to deduct the amount of CZK 647,000.
o
The Slovak tax administration requested in 2004, via the SCAC form, a verification of the supply of goods (copying machines) to the Czech payer worth 24 246K Sk made in December 2002.
These goods were purchased by a Slovak payer in November 2002 in SR from another tax entity for a value of 29 667 thousand Sk and subsequently sold to a Czech payer.
The Slovak taxpayer claimed an excess VAT deduction for the relevant tax period.
A tax investigation carried out in the Czech Republic found that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administration and did not file DAPs for the 4th quarter of 2002 or the following period.
The SAO SR found that the Slovak tax administration, based on the outcome of the tax inspection, did not recognise the right to an excess deduction of EUR 5 541 000. Sk applied in the DAP for the month of 11/2002 and set the tax liability at 1 750 thousand Sk.
At the same time, that taxpayer was not granted a VAT exemption in respect of exports of goods in December 2002.
o
The Czech tax administrator received an order from MF CLO to verify the value of the purchased goods for Q3 2004.
According to the VIES data, the Czech payer was to purchase from SR goods (diluent) worth 3,767 thou.
This tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administration, did not file a DAP and was assessed ex officio VAT for months 7 to 12/2004 at the rate of 0 CZK.
The Czech tax administrator asked through the SCAC form to verify whether the delivery of goods from SR to the Czech Republic took place, in what quantity and price (according to invoices).
In reply, Slovakia's locally competent tax office sent a copy of the invoice, the bill of lading and a demand for payment of the invoice.
The SAO SR found that the Slovak payer was granted an exemption with a right to deduct VAT on that supply.
The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech tax administration had assessed the response to the request for information received from SR as evidence showing that the company had acquired goods from another EU Member State.
Upon further investigation, the Tax Office in the Czech Republic will request a superior authority to review the tax liability.
o
The Slovak company supplied goods (particle products) to, among others, an American company that deposited these goods in the Czech Republic in a free zone.
The operator of this free zone was listed on invoices as the consignee of the goods.
In 2004, for example, an American company purchased $57,600 worth of particle board from a Slovak payer (at a unit price of $100/piece), which it placed in a free zone.
Subsequently, the company transferred ownership of the goods to a Swiss company, for a value of USD 14 400 (unit price USD 25/piece) and the goods were exported back to SR.
The goods were not unloaded in the Czech Republic, but left the free zone area on the same means of transport.
The Slovak tax administration has initiated tax inspections of individual tax years 2004 and 2005 with the supplier of goods on suspicion of carousel transactions.
The verification of the underlying transactions was requested from the Czech locally competent tax authorities via several SCAC forms.
Individual responses gradually built up a picture of the shops and confirmed the involvement of stakeholders from the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the carousel shops.
The SAO, the Czech Republic, in cooperation with the SAO of the Slovak Republic, found that in these trade relations there was a deliberate gradual decrease in the value of the goods.
On the basis of the information gathered, the SR Tax Directorate concluded that in this case of carousel trade there is free pricing (i.e. the importation of undervalued goods and its overestimation by domestic companies in the importer-exporter chain) which is not an infringement of the VAT Act in the SR.
Under current legislation, the payment of excess VAT to export companies cannot be avoided as they fulfil all the conditions of the Act to exempt supplies from VAT.
o
The Czech taxpayer had his VAT registration revoked on 12 July 2005.
On 27 October 2005, following a voluntary application for VAT registration, that body became taxable again.
The Czech taxpayer entered into the DAP for the month of 8/2005 (i.e. the period when he was not subject to VAT) the value of the acquisition of goods (a printing press) from SR amounting to CZK 1,174,000 and claimed the right to deduct VAT.
This value corresponded to a supply of goods from a Slovak payer amounting to 1 530 thousand Sk, which the Slovak payer listed in the DAP as a supply of goods to another EU Member State with a right to deduct VAT.
The Slovak tax administrator asked to verify the said delivery using the SCAC form because the Slovak supplier had not shown how he acquired the goods delivered to the Czech Republic.
The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administration and did not reside at the address listed in the Commercial Register.
As part of the international exchange of information, a local investigation will be carried out in the Czech Republic by the locally competent tax authority to examine the data.
o
The Slovak payer reported in the recapitulative statement for Q3 2004 supplies of goods worth 956K. Sk tax entity from the Czech Republic.
The Czech entity's VAT number was marked as erroneous by VIES.
A check in the payers' database revealed that such a TIN was never allocated in the Czech Republic.
According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was the execution of electro-fitting works on real estate in the Czech Republic, not the delivery of goods from SR to the Czech Republic, but the provision of services.
The services were invoiced without VAT as the Czech entity told the Slovak entity that it was registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic.
The Slovak tax administration requested to verify the facts by using the SCAC form.
The SAO, the Czech Republic, by enquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic, found that the tax entity named on the invoices as a customer was never registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic, did not declare the tax on the services received from the Slovak entity and did not declare the tax on the acquisition of goods.
There was no local investigation or tax check with the Czech entity, its current whereabouts are unknown.
On the basis of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax authorities learned that the Czech taxpayer had become a taxpayer of VAT by law by accepting the service.
The Slovak tax entity will be subject to a tax audit for the first to fourth quarters of 2004.
o
The Slovak payer reported in the recapitulative statement for Q3 2004 the delivery of goods worth CZK 1,055,000. Sk to the Czech payer.
According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was the execution of electro-fitting works on real estate in the Czech Republic.
This was not a supply of goods from SR to the Czech Republic, but a supply of services.
The Slovak tax administration requested to verify the facts by using the SCAC form.
The SAO, the Czech Republic, enquired at the local tax administration in the Czech Republic, found that the Czech entity was a VAT payer at the time of the supply and that a local investigation was carried out on it to verify the acquisition of goods from other EU Member States in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
On the basis of this local investigation, it was found that the present case was not really an acquisition of goods but an acquisition of services, which was also reported by the Czech entity in a proper DAP.
Furthermore, the tax office found that the Czech operator had not paid VAT at the correct amount for the tax period of Q3 2004 as a result of a bad procedure in the calculation of VAT.
The tax entity shall submit an additional DAP.
The SAO SR enquired at the local competent tax office and found that the Slovak payer had misstated the provision of the service in the recapitulative statement and would be subject to a tax audit for the 1st to 4th quarters of 2004.
o
The Czech tax entity has voluntarily registered as a VAT payer since 10 March 2004.
For Q1 2004, DAP reported high turnover on both inputs and outputs.
The locally competent tax administration initiated the tax procedure, the subject did not cooperate with the tax administration, so he was assessed VAT of 0 CZK due to suspicion of involvement in the carousel business.
Another DAP was not filed by that payer.
He had his VAT registration cancelled on 4.1.2005 because of a failure to comply with the law.
According to the VIES data, this entity was to acquire from the Slovak payer in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2004 goods worth 7,846K Sk.
In order to verify the execution of these transactions, the Czech tax authorities sent two requests for information to SR.
The SAO SR enquired at the local tax office and found that the manager of the Czech company had denied the transactions examined in testimony and questioned the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.
As a result of the SR tax procedure, intra-Community deliveries to the Czech Republic declared by the Slovak payer were challenged.
The payer will not be recognised as entitled to VAT exemption and will be charged VAT on the above amount.
o
According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods (work clothes) from SR in the 1st quarter of 2005 for a total value of 39 970 thou Sk.
In this quarter, the Czech payer reported acquisitions of goods from another EU Member State only in DAP for the month 3/2005, amounting to CZK 11,292,000.
The locally competent tax administration carried out a local investigation on the subject to verify the data in this DAP.
As the company did not produce any documents or otherwise prove that the taxable transactions had been carried out, the tax authorities charged VAT of CZK 0 on 9 June 2005.
Due to doubts about the realisation of the acquisition of the goods, the tax authorities sent two requests for information to SR in May 2005.
According to the reply to the requests for information, the SR tax authorities had doubts about the realisation of business cases as well as the realisation of the payment.
The SAO was informed that the Slovak tax administration had sent the DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out at the participating entities.
At the time of the coordinated inspection, the local tax administration was carrying out further enquiries concerning the Czech entity in the Czech Republic, while an investigation by the Police of the Czech Republic was ongoing.
o
The following 2 cases concern companies suspected of involvement in carousel fraud.
Transactions in goods (working clothes) were made between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.
Slovak payer No 1 supplied goods to Czech payer No 2.
In the Czech Republic, the goods were then sold to payer No 3, who supplied them back to SR to payer No 4 (see Diagram No 2).
A)
Czech payer No 2 was to purchase goods (work clothes) worth 4,847,000 CZK from Slovak payer No 1 in Q4 2004 and goods worth 17,050,000 CZK in Q1 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the DAP did not correspond to the VIES data, the locally competent tax authority sent a request for information to SR on 25.5.2005.
In reply, the Slovak tax administrator expressed doubts about the realisation of the business cases as well as the realisation of the payment.
On 8.6.2005, a request for information was received at MF CLO from SR, concerning goods worth 16 575 thou Sk to be delivered by Slovak payer No 1 to Czech payer No 2 in December 2004.
The Slovak side demanded to check whether the Czech No 2 had actually accepted the goods, admitted them in the DAP and paid VAT.
An official record drawn up by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic shows that the Czech taxpayer No 2 has not resided at an address registered in the Commercial Register for a long time.
Although he was a VAT payer with a monthly tax year, he filed a DAP for the quarterly tax year.
In view of this, the Czech tax authorities could not assess VAT.
Implementation of the taxable transaction between Slovak payer No 1 and Czech payer No 2 mentioned in the application in the amount of EUR 16 575,000. Sk could not be verified due to the above.
The Czech tax administrator suspected the involvement of both entities in the carousel business for the purpose of drawing an excess VAT deduction.
(B)
Czech payer No 3, who deals with the purchase and sale of passenger cars, filed a DAP for the tax period of months 1 and 2/2005, in which he declared the supply of goods (work clothes) to Slovak payer No 4 for a total value of CZK 21,935,000.
These work clothes were to be purchased by Czech payer No 3 from Czech payer No 2 between December 2004 and January 2005.
The locally competent tax office sent a request for information to SR, mainly to verify that Slovak payer No 4 had purchased goods worth CZK 1,025,000 from Czech payer No 3 in December 2004 and CZK 21,935,000 in Q1 2005.
The response to this request for information received from SR showed that in the DAP for the month 12/2004 the Slovak payer No 4 stated the zero value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in the DAP for months 1 and 2/2005 the value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State was only 1 193 thousand Sk.
No 4 did not respond to the request for tax documents for the tax period of months 10/2004 to 3/2005.
A local investigation carried out in SR revealed that the company was not located at the address listed in the Commercial Register.
The reply further stated that this payer meets all the characteristics of a so-called "lost company" and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.
The SAO was informed that the Slovak tax administration had sent the DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out at the participating tax entities.
During the coordinated inspection, the Czech tax authorities collected documents that would confirm or deny the existence of the goods.
VAT will be calculated on the basis of the outcome of the investigation.
The case is also being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
Control Action Progress
In order to prepare for the parallel audits, a coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO of the Slovak Republic took place in the first half of July 2005.
The participants in that meeting were acquainted with the VAT legislation in both states and the incorporation of the VIES electronic system into the national databases.
The negotiations resulted in the specification of the extent of cooperation and the setting of conditions for the selection of control samples.
The two sides agree that cooperation will focus on the following areas: (b) verifying data on intra-Community acquisitions reported in the DAP by payers in the Czech Republic using information from summary reports (hereinafter referred to as ‘SH’) of payers from the SR included in the VIES system, and vice versa; (c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic on the commercial transactions made.
Furthermore, it was agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection would be made following the volume of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic via the SCAC form.
5.1 Intracomunitary transactions
The procedure for processing information by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic for intra-Community supply and acquisition of goods is shown in the following diagram.
5.1.1 Intracomunitary Delivery
Where a VAT payer makes an intra-Community supply, he shall be required to submit to the SH by the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.
A payer in the Czech Republic presents in the SH summary information on his VAT-exempt supplies of goods to another EU Member State for the previous calendar quarter.
The payer in SR is obliged to enter into the SH the value of goods that have been exempt and delivered from the national territory to other EU Member States for the calendar quarter period.
The data on the value of the goods supplied are always given in the SH in Czech and Slovak currency, broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their TIN, under which they were registered in their country.
Service data are not included in the SH.
If a payer in the Czech Republic discovers that he has given erroneous data in the SH, he is obliged to give a subsequent SH.
If the payer in SR finds that the information given in the SH was incomplete or incorrect, he shall submit a corrective SH before the expiry of the deadline for the submission of the SH, after which time he shall submit an additional SH.
VIES allows the exchange of information on VAT registered payers' registration data in EU Member States.
Payees from the Czech Republic and SR respectively can verify that the respective purchaser's TIN is registered in a given EU Member State.
Data from submitted SHs are grouped by individual TIN of purchasers on the MF CLO and DR CLO respectively by VIES.
It will create the aggregate value of all deliveries for each VAT number of the acquirer and the code of the delivery method from all its Czech and Slovak suppliers, the so-called L1QD files.
Data from files L1QDs shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.
The total value of intra-Community transactions between CR and SR (from L1QD files) is shown in the table below.
If VIES in another Member State detects a wrong customer ID in the L1QD files sent, it generates the so-called O_MCTL message, which contains all the wrong VAT number, indicating the type of error.
This report is then sent to the MF CLO or DR CLO respectively.
The O_MCTL message can contain 4 types of errors: formally erroneous TIN, TIN not registered in the state or never allocated, the purchaser with a TIN was not subject to VAT in the quarter, the purchaser's VAT registration was terminated during the quarter.
In the Czech Republic, the MF CLO transmits data from received O_MCTL reports to the tax authorities.
If the wrong TIN of the EU payer is used in any of the SH or subsequent SH lines sent, a so-called "Notice of Doubt to VAT ID" is generated at the relevant IRS by the ADIS system.
The tax office will check that the delivery to a taxpayer registered for VAT in another EU Member State has actually taken place and will record the result of the verification in the system.
In SR, the DR CLO in VIES processes all O_MCTL messages and transmits them electronically to the locally competent tax authorities together with the identification of the taxpayers who have given the wrong TIN in their SHs.
The tax authorities then invite the payer to submit an additional SH and, when reporting invalid TIN in the SH file, the tax office checks the delivery of the goods with the relevant payer.
Data on the number of erroneous TIN relating to intra-Community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are shown in the table below.
Of the total number of 41 728 TIN Czech payers listed in the SH Slovak payers during the period from Q2 2004 to Q1 2005, 929 were erroneous TIN, or 2.23%.
Of the 62,997 TIN of Slovak payers listed in the SH of Czech payers during the same period, 416 were erroneous TIN, i.e. 0.66%.
When reporting intra-Community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, Czech VAT payers reported on average fewer erroneous TIN's in their SH than SR payers.
An examination of the activities of the financial and tax authorities revealed that VIES did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of taxable persons in all cases.
For example:
- although the VIES system confirmed the validity of the taxpayer's registration in Q4 2004 when questioned by the Tax Administrator in the Czech Republic, the O_MCTL report was subsequently generated due to the termination of the payer's registration this quarter.
The investigation found that the termination of the registration took place only on 1.1.2005;
- The SAO also found that 6 tax entities filed an SH in which the wrong TIN was reported, but the O_MCTL reports did not include this TIN.
In SR, the submitted SHs are converted into electronic form at the tax offices and the data from them is sent to the DR CLO.
Following the subsequent processing of this data in VIES, the DR CLO shall send to the relevant tax authorities the so-called SH error breakdowns submitted by the tax entities for the respective quarters.
The SAO SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH at 26.7.2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection) and at 2.2.2006 (i.e. data processed after the completion of the inspection).
The data reconciliation is presented in the table below.
The above data show that the SAO audit of SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with erroneous TIN (on average by 199 SH per quarter) but also on the reduction of the number of unrepaired errors in SH (on average by 431 errors per quarter).
In the Czech Republic, the value of intra-Community deliveries reported by the payer in the relevant DAP rows is compared at the financial offices with the value of intra-Community deliveries reported by this payer in the quarterly SH.
The ADIS system automatically indicates differences between these values.
The tax manager should examine the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the data obtained in determining the tax liability.
The SAO, Czech Republic found that the audited tax authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.
The total difference between the values in SH and DAP in these cases was 537,231,000 CZK.
Since Q3 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administration in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values given in the SH and the DAP of up to 0.5% of the total value of intra-Community supplies according to the SH as a match and to set it in the ADIS system.
For payers with a large volume of intra-Community deliveries per quarter, 0.5% of the value is a not insignificant amount, therefore tax administrations in these cases should not set the SH and DAP compliance without explaining the causes of the differences.
For example, the tax administrator, without verification, set the match in case of a difference in values of CZK 1,561,000.
Examination of differences in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was complicated by the fact that SH was filed by payers for each calendar quarter within 25 days after the end of this quarter.
Tax authorities could not compare the intra-community delivery values in those DAPs with the SH values for payers with a monthly tax year at the time of DAP submission for the first two months of the calendar quarter.
In those cases, the tax authorities became aware of any data mismatch in the DAPs and SHs only when the tax liability or excess VAT deduction was assessed or refunded.
5.1.2 Intracomanial acquisition
VIES provides, inter alia, information on the values of intra-Community transactions made within EU Member States.
Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, data received from SH submitted by payers from other EU Member States (delivered by L1QD) are processed by MF CLO.
In the processing, the data are recalculated by the minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared with the acquisition value reported by the Czech payers in the DAP for the relevant quarter.
The value of acquisitions reported by payers in the DAP should be within the minimum and maximum converted values of L1QD (values L1min and L1max).
If the value reported in the DAP is less than L1min, a so-called validation order is generated for payers with the most significant irregularities.
Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax entities and are transmitted to the locally competent tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.
The number of verification orders concerning audited financial authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the table below.
The SAO, Czech Republic found that in 33 cases audited financial authorities did not check for irregularities in the values of intra-Community acquisitions indicated by the verification orders received.
The total difference between the values reported in the SH of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers in these cases was at least CZK 148,319,000.
The SAO, Czech Republic selected for inspection 533 files of tax entities for which audited tax authorities received a verification order from MF CLO.
In the following cases, the most common causes of the differences between the values given in the purchaser's DAP and in the supplier's SH were found: on the purchaser's side (Czech payer), in 263 cases, the purchaser did not declare the purchase of goods in the correct DAP, in 93 cases the payer acknowledged the acquisition of goods in a different tax period than the one in which he was required to declare VAT, in 6 cases the purchaser reported the value of goods acquired in the wrong line of the DAP, on the supplier's side (EU payer's) in 88 cases the EU payer included the value of goods in their SHSR included the values of goods supplied to the Czech payer.
On the SR payers' side, the most frequent erroneous inclusion of the value of the services provided was in the SH.
54 such cases were identified at audited tax offices.
For example, when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10,974,000 was created by the Slovak payer entering into the SH for the 1st quarter of 2005 the provision of services (construction work and delivery of goods including assembly in the territory of the Czech Republic).
Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of the received advances in the SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers indicated in the SH received advances from Czech payers, resulting in a command to verify the difference of CZK 3,580,000.
Orders to verify acquired goods are generated only once per quarter.
In cases where data from the SH are subsequently changed in EU Member States, such as a change in the purchaser of goods in the Czech Republic or an increased value of delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new validation orders are not generated.
Since the VIES system does not automatically notify these changes, the locally competent tax authority of the person acquiring the goods may, without any other initiative, be unaware of the facts relevant to the correct determination of the tax liability on the goods acquired, and there is a strong likelihood of VAT evasion.
An audit by the SAO, the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:
The Slovak payer reported in the SH for Q2 2004 the value of the supply of goods to the Czech payer at 1 504 thousand Sk.
On 1.2.2005, the tax office of the locally competent Czech payer sent a request for information to SR, as the Czech payer admitted acquiring goods only in the amount of CZK 425,000.
As a result of the tax procedure, the Slovak payer filed an additional BI on 1 March 2005, in which he corrected the details of the delivery of the goods to the Czech Republic, by reducing the value of the delivery for the Czech payer initially mentioned to 538K. Sk and by increasing the value of the goods delivered to another Czech payer from the amount of £194,000. Sk to the value of 1,160 thou Sk.
Four Slovak payers reported intra-Community deliveries to payers from the Czech Republic totalling 10,240,000 CZK (or 8,183,000 CZK) in their SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech acquirers did not report intra-Community acquisitions in the DAP.
On the basis of the international exchange of information, it was established that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer not mentioned in the SH filed by Slovak payers.
During the 1st quarter of 2005, Slovak payers increased the value of intra-Community deliveries for this Czech payer by a total of 10 240 thou in the additional SH relating to the 2nd quarter of 2004.
In view of the above, the locally competent tax authority in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the correctness of the data in DAP's submission for Q2 2004, even if the actual acquirer failed to comply with the obligation to declare intra-Community acquisitions for that quarter.
The SAO, Czech Republic, found that on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the aforementioned Czech taxpayer was additionally assessed VAT for tax years 5 and 6/2004 of 3,640,000 CZK and for Q3 2004 of 3,305,000 CZK on purchased goods during these periods.
It can be seen from the above that tax administrations have had to examine in tax proceedings not only differences arising from errors in the acquirer's DAP, but also differences due to different reporting of intra-Community supply and acquisition data across EU Member States.
Unifying the conditions for reporting these data would lead to streamlining the control activities of tax administrations.
Acquisition of goods in SR
In SR, the APV DIS system makes it possible to compare the data on the value of goods acquired through VIES from other EU Member States with the data listed in the DAP of Slovak acquirers.
The method by which the data are compared is called the ‘MIN-MAX method’.
This method recalculates the delivery values of the goods specified in the BI of payers from other EU Member States at the minimum and maximum exchange rate for the quarter in question.
The MIN-MAX interval will be created, which is used for comparisons with the acquisition values listed in the DAP of Slovak payers.
The DR CLO will send information to tax administrations on the values of intra-community acquisitions listed in the DAP and the values of EU deliveries in VIES.
The tax authorities will decide for which VAT-registered persons the difference will be checked, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.
Based on data provided by the DR CLO, the SAO collected 57 files of Slovak purchasers of goods for inspection at audited tax offices, of which 25 payers also acquired goods from the Czech Republic, for which the highest differences were found between the acquisition values obtained from the VIES system and those declared in the DAP.
The audit carried out by the SAO of the Slovak Republic confirmed that the tax authorities did not rigorously verify the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and thus did not verify the accuracy of the data given in the Slovak acquirers' DAP.
As part of the audit, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations with specific tax entities.
During the audit of SAO SR at tax offices, 31 local investigations were completed.
For Slovak companies, which showed significant differences in MIN-MAX values when acquiring goods from EU member countries, the following were found to be among others:
In the DAP for Q4 2004, the Slovak payer did not give the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.
The tax office found that a company from the Czech Republic had mistakenly given the VAT number of this payer in SH for the 4th quarter of 2004, while goods worth 19 184 thousand CZK were actually delivered to another Slovak payer.
Under the VIES system, the Slovak company was to acquire goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the 4th quarter of 2004 worth MIN 682 692 thousand Sk and MAX 715 105 thousand Sk.
This company filed DAPs for the periods in which it reported an EU acquisition value of only 480 599 thousand.
The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, finding that the tax entity purchased electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.
Suppliers to SH and to DAP did not indicate intra-Community deliveries by invoice date, but by delivery date.
Due to further irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU states, the tax authorities will request a verification of the value of the goods supplied using SCAC forms.
Acquisition of goods from EU member countries in Q4 2004 was not reported by the Slovak payer in the DAP.
Under the VIES system, this payer was to purchase goods worth MIN 11,286 thousand Sk and MAX 11,845 thousand Sk.
The tax office carried out a local investigation, which showed that the taxpayer had not purchased any goods from EU member countries in Q4 2004.
The SAO recommended that the tax office request a verification of the delivery of goods from EU member countries via the SCAC form.
In the VIES system, delivery of goods to a Slovak customer of MIN 557,000 Sk and MAX 565,000 Sk was reported.
In the DAP for the tax period of months 10 to 12/2004, the payer did not report any acquisitions of goods.
A local investigation by the tax administration found that the tax entity received an invoice from a supplier in the Czech Republic on 10 December 2004 for materials consumed in the repair of a hydraulic loader.
The SAO recommended a tax audit of the payer.
During the audit of the SAO of the Slovak Republic, in 16 cases the tax authorities did not complete the local investigation.
In 10 cases, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out a tax audit on the tax entities.
Reports on the results of local investigations and tax inspections will be filed by the tax authorities after their implementation by the SAO.
Examples were:
The Slovak purchaser did not declare the acquisition of goods from EU member countries in the DAP for the 4th quarter of 2004 and did not declare any tax for the tax period of 10 to 12/2004 and claimed a refund of excess VAT totalling 1,236 thousand Sk.
The tax administrator carried out a local investigation which showed that the taxpayer had purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth EUR 683,000 (about EUR 27,080,000 Sk).
The said goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to the customs office in Čiernej nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.
A Slovak payer for customers in the Russian Federation issued an invoice for the amount of EUR 683,000, which was not mentioned in the DAP submission.
The tax authority carries out a tax audit on the taxpayer.
The difference between the acquisition data reported in the Slovak payer's DAP for Q3 2004 to Q1 2005 and the data on deliveries reported by EU member state payers for each quarter was a total of 4,800,000 CZK.
The tax office found that the taxpayer purchased goods from suppliers in the Czech Republic and Belgium and then sold those goods to Ukraine.
The invoices were accompanied by an export single customs declaration.
The acquisition of goods in the DAP was not specified by the tax entity, according to the statement of the company's manager, goods in transit were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine.
The taxpayer did not submit any VAT records at the time of the local investigation.
A tax audit has been initiated on the payer.
5.2 International Level L3 Information Exchange
The exchange of information at level L3 is initiated by locally competent tax administrations who send their requests for information (RFID) or spontaneous information (SPI) relating to a particular tax entity or transaction through MF CLO, respectively.
DR CLO to another EU member country. For example, the objective of the LIO is to demonstrate the execution of a given transaction in intra-Community transactions, to verify a certain TIN, etc.
In the case of SPI, this is a communication of information relevant to tax administrations in another EU Member State.
Cooperation in the exchange of information is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The maximum time limit for responding to YEI was set at 3 months in Article 8 of this Regulation.
The conditions for the admissibility of applications are governed by the Decision of the Commission of the European Communities of 15.11.2004, which provides that, unless otherwise agreed by the Participating States, the ŽOI must relate to commercial transactions with a value of at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.
Where the RU relates to a commercial transaction of less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may refuse to respond in view of its workload.
The procedure for handling received YEI by the Tax Administration of the Czech Republic, including the indication of the internal timescales set for processing at individual organisational levels, is illustrated in the following diagram.
In the SR, the deadline for the discharge of the RU by the tax authorities has been set internally at 2 months so that the three-month deadline under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 can be met.
The MF CLO accepted a total of 29 RWs and 3 SPIs from SR from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005.
Of the 29 RUs accepted, 26 (or 89.7%) were discharged within the time limit of 3 months and 3 (or 10.3%) were discharged after that time limit.
During the same period, DR CLO accepted a total of 71 ZhOI and 7 SPI from the Czech Republic.
Of the 71 RUs accepted, 64 (i.e. 90.1%) were discharged within the stipulated time limit of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7.0%) were discharged after this time limit (for the remaining 2 cases, no discharge deadline could be determined from the material transmitted).
More detailed data on the time taken to process YES received by MF CLOs and DR CLOs are given in the following graph.
Reasons for sending an APO, as stated on SCAC forms, are given in the following table.
Conclusion
Compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT, as well as the use of the VIES system to exchange information between EU Member States, in particular to monitor the exercise of the right to VAT exemption, has been tested on the basis of international cooperation.
International cooperation made it possible to examine selected intra-Community transactions between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
An examination of the selected transactions revealed that, on the basis of an international exchange of information, the tax administrations of the two countries had detected cases of companies making fictitious intra-Community commercial transactions to obtain excess VAT deductions, as well as cases where the purchasers had failed to declare the correct amount of VAT on supplies received.
Furthermore, the audit found differences in the processing and use of VIES data by the tax administrations of the two countries.
The audit also highlighted problems caused by different reporting of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions data across EU Member States.
The harmonisation of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to streamlining of the control activities of national tax administrations.
Examination of the VAT administration and use of the VIES system by the financial and tax authorities revealed that the VIES system was not sufficiently used by all VIES options and the relevant statutory authorisations.
Furthermore, it was found that the VIES system did not in all cases provide up-to-date information on deliveries of goods and on the validity of taxable persons' VAT registration.
The SAO SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH, processed before the start of the inspection, with the data processed after the completion of the inspection.
From the comparison of these data, it was clear that the SAO audit of SR had an effect not only on reducing the number of IA with erroneously reported TIN, but also on reducing the number of unrepaired errors in the SH.
In case of discrepancies in the reported data, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out local investigations or to carry out tax checks.
The SAO, Czech Republic did not have such an option under the current legislation in the Czech Republic.
The lessons learned from the audit action showed that VIES provided tax administrations with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.
As there continues to be scope for tax evasion in this area, increased attention needs to be paid to intra-community transactions when managing VAT.

This report was prepared in Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the President of the Najvyššie Audit Office of the Slovak Republic.
Parallel control of the administration of value added tax and excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Introduction Word
This information material provides an overview of the progress and results of parallel control actions carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which focused on the area of administration based on added value and excise duties.
Cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the two countries was carried out on the basis of the control cooperation agreement concluded in February 2004.
The theme of the parallel control actions was chosen in view of the fact that indirect taxes contribute significantly to the revenue of the national budgets of both countries.
The design of value added tax, allowing the refund of excess deduction, provides scope for tax fraud or evasion.
High rates of excise duty, particularly on tobacco and tobacco products, ethyl alcohol and mineral oils, mean high profits for those who escape taxation by illegally selling these goods.
Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.
Given the need to address this issue comprehensively across the European Union, the VAT Working Group has been set up by the supreme audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union, with both countries' highest audit offices actively involved.
The greatest benefits of the control actions undertaken can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but in particular in the joint effort to identify problem areas of indirect tax management in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion.
The experience and knowledge gained will be used in the framework of planned indirect tax controls, mainly aimed at involving the tax administrations of the two States in the VIES system, which allows the movement of goods between the Member States of the European Union to be controlled.
Report on the results of the Value Added Tax and Excise Administration Review for 2002 and 2003
1. Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004
Object of control:
(CZ) Value added tax and excise duties
(SK) Control of the tax administration process for the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and excise duties
On 11.2.2004, the Contract for Cooperation in Audit Activities between the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the NajHigher Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (SAO SR) was concluded. The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implementation of parallel control actions "Value Added Tax and Excise Tax," included in the SAO's 2004 audit work plan under No 04/07, and "Control of the management process of dane pri administration, control and recovery of taxes on prized value and rebrebrebrebate taxes," included in SAO SR's audit work plan under No 18/2004.
The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract and producing a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.
Both parties undertook in the contract to provide each other with information from public sources, from the customs administration database and from the tax files kept by the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and the tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the contracting parties could not obtain when checking the application of value added tax and excise duties on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the relevant State.
The checks were carried out in parallel between January and August 2004.
In the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic), the control was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of southern Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.
The audited persons were the General Directorate of Customs and 12 selected financial offices: the Tax Office for Prague 1, the Tax Office for Prague 3, the Tax Office in Český Budějovice, the Tax Office in Frýdek-Místek, the Tax Office in Hodonin, the Tax Office in Jihlava, the Tax Office in Kostelec nad Orlicí, the Tax Office in Kroměříž, the Tax Office in Písek, the Tax Office in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, the Financial Office in Ústí nad Orlicí, the Financial Office in Velký Meziříčí.
The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as ‘SR’) was carried out by the Tax and Customs Division of the SAO SR in cooperation with the SAO Expozituras SR Banská Bystrica and Košice on 10 selected tax offices:
Bratislava Tax Office pre Selected Tax Entities, Bratislava Tax Office III, Trnava Tax Office, Pú-chov Tax Office, Banská Bystrica Tax Office I, Liptovský Mikuláš Tax Office, Žilina Tax Office I, Žilina II Tax Office, Košice Tax Office I and Košice Tax Office IV.
Target of control
The aim of the control actions was to examine the fulfilment of the obligations of financial and tax authorities and customs authorities in the administration of value added tax and excise duties, with a focus on the collection of such taxes on the import and export of goods and services.
The aim of international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the Customs Database and the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic and to verify them in tax returns at the relevant financial and tax offices respectively.
The audited period was 2002 and 2003.
2. Review of control results
2.1. General evaluation of control activities
In the framework of the international cooperation of the SAO, the SAO of the Czech Republic transmitted from the Customs Database 22 206 items of the Uniform Customs Declarations (hereinafter referred to as "JCD") on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, and vice versa, the SAO of the Slovak Republic forwarded 30 221 items of the JCD to the SAO of the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic.
A comparison was made between the printed JCD items from the Customs database of the Czech Republic and the Customs database of the Slovak Republic.
Out of 5,883 selected JCD items from the CR Customs Database, a total of 43% of related JCD items were assigned.
Out of the 12,343 selected JCD entries from the SR customs database, a total of 26% of the related JCD entries were assigned.
On the basis of the unassigned JCD entries, a selection of the files of the tax entities was made at the financial and tax offices, where the declared imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
Based on the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and the financial and tax authorities respectively, the implementation of the reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified in the territory of the second state.
The SAO and SAO SR carried out a joint pilot inspection at the Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma border customs crossing, in which both parties cooperated closely in verifying the accuracy of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
The audit did not identify any deficiencies in the record of selected cases of imports and exports of goods made in 2002.
International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions made between trading partners from both countries and has highlighted deficiencies in the record of imports and exports.
2.2. Summary of control results
The audit of the SAO and SAO of the Slovak Republic focused on imports and exports of spirit and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, as well as other types of goods, in the field of international cooperation.
On the basis of a check of the files of tax entities at selected financial and tax offices, the SAO asked for verification of the execution of exports of goods declared on 40 JCDs for a total statistical value of 15,301,093 CZK and the SAO SR for verification of exports for a statistical value of 56,989 Sk.
Among other things, the SAO and SAO SR found the following:
- the commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, making it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the Customs Database of the Czech Republic and the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic,
- errors in the entry of data into customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports,
- there has been no evidence of corresponding imports into the SR for some Czech exports.
In such cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of improperly claiming value added tax deductions;
- Tax entities failed to comply with some of the statutory obligations in reporting imports and exports on value added tax returns;
- shortcomings have been identified in the work of the financial and/or tax offices in the administration of value added tax and excise duties and in their interaction with customs offices.
In the field of value added tax and excise duties, international trade will continue to need attention in order to effectively minimise tax evasion.
In particular, it is important to improve the activity of tax administrations in the administration of value added tax.
The basis for effective control of excise duties is the control of document circulation, systematic physical control of goods and mutual exchange of information on the import and export of goods.
3. Description of the value added tax and excise tax situation
Value Added Tax
Value added tax (‘VAT’) was levied by the tax and tax authorities on taxable transactions effected within the country and by the customs authorities on importation of the goods.
The revenue from the tax was due to the difference between the tax liability collected and the excess VAT refunded in the case of the tax authorities.
The VAT revenue at the customs offices was determined by the amount of tax they collected.
The tax collected by the customs authorities was reflected, in accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, in the tax deductions applied to the financial and tax authorities respectively.
For most financial and tax authorities, excess VAT deductions exceeded tax liability.
VAT is one of the flagship taxes in terms of state budget revenue, as it accounted for about 31% of the tax revenue of the state budget of the Czech Republic in 2003 and approximately 42% of the tax revenue of the state budget of the Slovak Republic.
The total VAT collection in the Czech Republic amounted to CZK 162.9 billion in 2003.
The tax and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT refunds totalled CZK 231.4 billion.
The total VAT collection in SR in 2003 amounted to 83.8 bn Sk.
Tax and customs authorities collected 187.0 billion in VAT in 2003, and refunded excess VAT totalled 103.2 billion Sk.
Excise duties
The collection of excise duties (‘SpD’) was carried out by the competent financial and tax authorities and, on importation, by customs authorities of products subject to SpD.
The share of SpD in the tax revenues of the state budget in the Czech Republic was about 16% in 2003 and about 19% in SR.
The total collection of SpDs collected in the Czech Republic by financial and customs authorities in 2003 amounted to 85.6 billion CZK and in the Slovak Republic amounted to 38.0 billion CZK.
4. Control Action Progress
The cooperation between the SAO and SAO SR took place in two stages.
In the first stage, a comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was made; in the second stage, the results of this comparison were used in the mutual verification of the implementation of selected trade transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and in the checks carried out on the territory of the two states.
4.1.
Preparation of control action
The first proposal for cooperation on parallel VAT and SpD controls was presented at a working meeting of SAO and SAO SR representatives in April 2003.
In November 2003, a coordination meeting was held at which, among other things, a selection of commodities was agreed - goods which posed a significant risk in complying with customs and tax legislation: - ethyl alcohol, tariff headings 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, tariff headings 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, tariff headings 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, tariff subheadings 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.
The two parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be made: (a) from unallocated items identified by comparing exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic; (b) from entities carrying out imports and exports regularly or on a one-off basis in large volumes; (c) on the basis of findings from inspections carried out by selected tax and financial authorities.
4.2. Comparison of Customs Databases of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic
In the first stage, the mutual attribution mechanism of JCD items registered in the Customs Databases of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic was tested on a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002.
Subsequently, a proportion of exports from the Czech Republic were compared with imports into the Slovak Republic for 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the Customs Tariff:
- 2207 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol or higher; Ethyl alcohol and other spirits denatured, of any strength,
- 2208 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol; spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages,
- 2401 Unmanufactured tobacco; tobacco waste,
- 2402 Cigars (whether or not with their ends cut off), cigars (cigarillos) and cigarettes made of tobacco or tobacco substitutes,
- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and punishments (essences);
- 8525 20 91 Transmission apparatus containing reception equipment: For cellular network (mobile phones),
- 8525 20 99 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception equipment: Other,
- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with the apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.
Other: Parts of apparatus falling in subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.
The JCD entries from the Customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic were attributed to each other based on the conformity of the individual paragraphs of the JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration number of the vehicle carrying the cargo, date of crossing the national border, tariff heading, etc.).
The results of the comparison are presented in the following tables and graphs.
The cross-attribution of individual imports and exports was hampered by, among other things, the fact that trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides.
For example, an export from the Czech Republic declared on one export JCD was declared on the territory of SR for multiple import JCD, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.
Other factors influencing the success of the attribution were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, as well as the time shift between the registration of exports in the customs database of one country and the registration of corresponding imports in the customs database of another.
The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at the audited financial and tax offices respectively.
Priority was given to certain tax entities that carried out imports/exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, which could not be identified in both databases.
In addition, certain tax entities for which data on imports/exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were found in both databases were selected for the verification of the transactions reported on VAT returns.
4.3. Pilot check at Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing
The border customs crossing for the performance of the pilot inspection was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the CR and SR.
Pursuant to a bilateral agreement between the Customs Authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, the use of control sheets has been introduced at border customs crossing points between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic since 1 June 1998.
The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as far as possible, to provide an overview of the movement of means of transport transporting goods of a commercial nature within the customs area and to create the conditions for comparing customs registers with each other.
The joint pilot inspection was carried out from 8.3.2004 to 26.3.2004 and aimed at examining this system of customs control.
Procedure for the use of control sheets at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing:
1. Considering the vehicle, issuing a checklist and handing it to the driver.
2) Unloading the vehicle in the designated sector in the parking lot.
Customs discussions in the check-in hall of the Policia ČR, Policie SR, Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.
The check-in process was confirmed by each component stamping the control sheet.
3) Bringing the vehicle into the physical inspection area.
Presentation of the control sheet, JCD, or other documents, as appropriate, to the customs officer - check that all prescribed acts and documents have been carried out.
Execution of physical checks by relevant files.
Releasing the vehicle from customs.
Posru: When importing goods into the Czech Republic, the weighing vehicles were carried out directly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
When the goods were imported into SR, the vehicles weighed were carried out by the staff of the authorised legal entity.
The vehicles were then entered into a computerised record.
4.3.1 Control sample
Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic
The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the Customs Exports Database of the Czech Republic in 2002.
The composition of the control sample for exports is given in Table 4.
4.3.2. Control sheets and their records Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic
When exported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, the certificates of inspection were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these control sheets in an electronic database of exports.
Out of 453 JCD entries, the SAO SR tracked 256 cases of imports into the Slovak Republic, according to data from the Customs database of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The remaining 197 JCD items were identified by the SAO of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the workers of the Drietoma border customs crossing.
Exports from SR to CR
On export from SR to the Czech Republic, the control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
Out of a total of 339 JCD entries of the selected control sample, the SAO in cooperation with border customs crossing staff, Starý Hrozenkov assigned to 295 JCD entries the corresponding registration numbers of the control sheets.
The other 44 cases were identified in their records by the border customs checkpoint staff at Drietoma and the export of goods from SR to the Czech Republic was confirmed.
The SAO and SAO SR audit did not find deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the Old Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing.
4.4. Selected control findings when verifying business transactions
In the framework of international cooperation, the realisation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified from the supporting documents of customs administrations and financial and tax offices in the territory of the second state.
The following were verified for selected tax entities:
- whether the submitted JCD were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic,
- the fulfilment of the legal conditions for the application of the deduction of VAT on importation, the refund of excess VAT and the application of the exemption from VAT on exportation.
The verification of the commercial transactions found:
1. The SAO of SR requested verification of the implementation of alcohol exports at a statistical value of 56 989 Sk.
The SAO identified the corresponding imports in the Czech Customs Database at a statistical value of 42,624 CZK. r
2. The photographic equipment and accessories import and export company claimed an excess VAT deduction of CZK 3,740,664 in its VAT return for the month of December 2002.
In order to check reported exports from the Czech Republic, the SAO selected 3 JCD (16 items) with a statistical value of 1,274,822 CZK.
The SAO of SR identified 3 corresponding import JCD (17 items) at a statistical value of 1,724,321 Sk.
VAT was paid in the SR to the competent customs office.
3. The company, whose main business was the optical equipment business, applied a total excess VAT deduction in 2002 that was 4,1,36,000 CZK higher than the tax liability.
To verify the reported business activity, the SAO selected the export JCD (32 items) at a statistical value of 7,154,124 CZK.
The SAO SR found that this JCD corresponds to an import JCD (12 items) with a statistical value of 9,653,827 Sk.
VAT was paid in the SR to the competent customs office.
4. The company involved in, among other things, the purchase of goods for resale and sale, did not report any exports of goods in the 2002 and 2003 VAT returns filed.
According to the Customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of goods exports totalled 3,439,888 CZK in 2002.
Based on these facts, the SAO selected for verification 5 export JCD (5 items) for a total statistical value of CZK 669,839.
The SAO of SR identified 5 corresponding import JCD (5 items) at a statistical value of 1 012 656 Sk.
The audit of the SAO of the Slovak Republic at the competent tax office showed that the declared imports were carried out and VAT paid.
5. The company, whose business included the purchase of goods for resale, manufacture, installation and repair of electrical machinery and apparatus, declared exports of goods worth CZK 12,966,706 in VAT returns in 2002.
According to the Customs database of the Czech Republic, in 2002 the total value of exports was 14,474,381 CZK.
The SAO submitted 17 export JCDs (59 items) for a total statistical value of 2,975,122 CZK.
The SAO SR identified 13 JCD (50 items) in the SR Customs Database, with a statistical value of 3 621 370 Sk.
The SR Customs Database failed to identify the corresponding import JCD to 4 export JCD (9 items) totalling a statistical value of 399,776 CZK.
The relevant tax office in SR verified these imports with the taxpayer.
The tax entity, listed on the JCD as an importer into SR, commented in the minutes of the local investigation that it had not carried out the imports declared on the Czech export JCD.
The SAO of SR therefore asked the local competent tax office to carry out a VAT and corporation tax audit for the tax years 2002 and 2003.
6. A company involved in the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco stickers worth CZK 7,338,199 in 2002 and CZK 12,228,545 in 2003, according to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic.
In its VAT returns, the company reported no exports in 2002 and 2003.
The SAO selected for verification 5 export JCD (5 items) totalling a statistical value of 2,471,598 CZK.
For 4 export JCD (4 items) in a total statistical value of 2,246,860 CZK, the SAO SR identified 7 JCD (7 items) in a statistical value of 2,919,514 Sk in the Customs Database SR.
A corresponding import could not be attributed to the export JCD (1 item) in statistical value of CZK 224,738 in the SR customs database.
7. The software delivery company did not report goods exports in its 2002 and 2003 VAT returns.
According to the Customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of goods exports in 2002 and 2003 totalled 1,630,198 CZK.
The SAO selected 9 JCD (9 items) for verification in SR, with a total statistical value of CZK 755,588.
In the Customs Database SR, the SAO identified 8 JCD (8 items) in statistical value 915 601 Sk.
The export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of £68,286 could not be attributed to the corresponding import in the SR customs database.
In those cases, it was not possible to identify in the SR customs database the corresponding imports to 6 JCD with a statistical value of 692,800 CZK.
Of which:
- 2 export JCD from the CR Customs Database at a statistical value of 293,024 CZK, the SR Customs Database failed to identify the corresponding import JCD (see paragraphs 6 and 7).
Due to a certain error rate in the entry of data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some of the registered imports, e.g. in cases where the name of the importer was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number (TIN).
It can therefore not be established with certainty that those exports did not take place.
- 4 export JCDs from the Customs database of the Czech Republic were not shown to have imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic at a statistical value of 399,776 CZK (see point 5).
In such cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of the fictitious export of the goods for the purpose of improperly claiming the VAT deduction.
5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services within the control of selected financial and tax authorities
5.1. Check pattern
In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of taxable persons in respect of imports and exports of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between financial and customs authorities, the files of taxable persons have been selected at the audited financial and tax offices, according to the following criteria:
1. tax subjects were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic: (a) with the highest volume of imports, (b) with the highest amount of VAT charged, (c) with the highest volume of exports,
(a) the VAT deductions applied on importation; (b) the excess VAT deductions applied; (c) the right to a refund of SpD; (d) the VAT exemption applied on exportation;
3. tax entities that have been subject to a tax audit.
The sampling was carried out irrespective of the country of destination with a focus on risky commodities.
5.2. Checking findings in the Czech Republic
An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is given in the table below:
5.2.1. Inspection of selected sample at tax offices
The SAO focused on the audited financial authorities in particular on:
- the process of the tax authorities in verifying the accuracy of the VAT declared,
- the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs administration,
- Comparing data from the customs database with the JCD database at the tax offices with a focus on comparing the declared value, applying the correct VAT rate following the tariff classification of goods or services, or comparing data on JCD and accompanying invoices with data in the customs database,
- Comparing data from VAT returns on transactions made and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at tax offices or in the customs database,
- how to verify entitlement to VAT exemption when exporting goods or services abroad;
- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services declared in VAT returns with data from the customs database.
The JCD database at the tax offices contained only records of those imports and exports in respect of which the taxpayer was obliged to enter the import or export on a tax return.
At the audited tax offices, the files of the tax entities were examined, which reported imports totalling CZK 60,396,379,000 in 2002 and 2003 in the tax returns, with corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12,644,052,000.
Furthermore, the files of tax entities reporting exports worth a total of CZK 47,323,111 in tax returns for 2002 and 2003 were checked.
According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic in 2002 and 2003, the tax subjects who were examined for imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out imports into the Czech Republic from the Slovak Republic with a total VAT base of CZK 3,759,352,000, VAT of CZK 767,607,000 and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 1,989,090,000.
The detected differences between the records in the JCD database at the tax offices and in the Customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:
- JCD items that were missing from the CR Customs Database were requested directly from the General Directorate of Customs of the CR,
- the JCD items that were missing from the tax authorities' database were verified as not being cancelled documents,
- for JCD items where different values were found between the Customs database of the Czech Republic and the Financial Offices database, the relevant JCD was requested from the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic in written form including the accompanying invoices.
The examination revealed that the JCD database at the tax offices did not contain, for example, records of import JCDs with a total value of VAT of 3,622,000 CZK and records of export JCDs with a total statistical value of 9,359,000 CZK.
5.2.1.1. Differences found
A comparison of the JCD database at the tax offices and the accumulated tax liability for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT returns for a selected sample of tax subjects revealed the following differences:
The differences in values were mainly due to:
- The time lag between the realisation of the imports and the exercise of the right to deduct the VAT charged on the importation of the goods.
The taxpayer could exercise the right to deduct on importation of the goods within three years of the end of the tax year in which the goods were placed under the relevant scheme or, in the case of the temporary importation scheme, within three years of the end of the tax year in which the scheme came to an end.
- The time lag between the export performance and the time when the taxpayer received the JCD.
The taxable person was required to enter the details of the exports effected, exempt from the obligation to apply output tax, in the VAT return at the earliest for the tax year in which the goods left the country, if he also had the tax document that was JCD.
- Failure to comply with the obligations of taxable persons when reporting imports and exports on VAT returns.
In some cases, the taxpayer did not enter the correct import and export details in the VAT returns.
Since tax entities did not have to attach JCD lists to filed VAT returns, it was made more difficult for tax authorities to control the right to deduct VAT or VAT exemption.
5.2.2. Synergies between financial and customs authorities
During the period under scrutiny, import or export duties and VAT were repaid or remitted as a result of decisions taken by the customs authorities.
The taxpayer was required by law to reduce the previously claimed right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax refunded by the customs office, in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.
No legislation provided for the sending of information on changes in the amount of duty and VAT from customs offices to tax offices.
Some audited tax authorities received this information, but irregularly or with significant delays, and only from some customs offices.
One audited IRS did not receive this information at all.
If the tax office did not receive information on changes in the amount of duty and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the data needed to check that the legal obligation on tax subjects was fulfilled.
In 2002, customs refunded VAT of more than CZK 319 million and in 2003 of more than CZK 398 million.
The results of the inspection pointed to persistent weaknesses in the activities of the tax authorities, some systemic errors in the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs authorities and the failure of some of the obligations of the payers filing VAT returns and SpD.
Shortcomings in VAT and SpD management were identified in particular in the following areas:
(a) on the cancellation of VAT registrations, the taxable person's obligation to pay VAT on the business property registered or to be registered on the date of the cancellation of the registration in respect of which the taxable person has deducted VAT has been verified only in isolated cases;
(b) the tax authorities have not consistently exercised the option to carry out a tax audit or a local investigation.
This has in some cases led to inadequate verification of the legitimacy of the right to deduct VAT,
(c) official records and minutes of oral proceedings did not contain all the necessary particulars proving that the excess VAT claimed was justified;
(d) the tax authorities did not sufficiently verify the imports and exports declared in the VAT returns.
5.3. SR control findings
5.3.1. Inspection of selected sample at tax offices
For the selected sample, the SAO audited or the tax office carried out a tax audit for the tax years 2002 and 2003.
After analysing the submitted tax returns and refund claims with the selected tax entities, the SAO of SR requested the tax office to secure the relevant JCDs showing import and export, invoices and proof of payment of tax.
Subsequently, the SAO SR checked whether the submitted JCD was registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of the decisive facts and legal conditions in the application of the deduction of input tax on imports, in the refund of excess VAT, in the application of the exemption from export tax and in the refund of SpD.
The SAO SR at 10 audited tax offices verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the SAR and the Czech Republic in the structure according to the number of JCD items and the sum of statistical values shown in the table below.
In total, imports were checked at a statistical value of 856.2 M. Sk, representing 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic to the SROV.
Exports of selected commodities were checked for a total statistical value of 176 million units, representing 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from the SR to the Czech Republic.
In addition, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white tech, packaging and software) from EU states to SR were checked for a total statistical value of 532.8 M. Sk.
5.3.2. Synergies between tax and customs
The SAO SR's audit of tax offices found discrepancies between the data registered in the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic and the data reported in specific VAT returns, e.g.:
- 2 tax subjects (natural persons) declared in their tax returns imports of goods totalling 1 589 261 Sk, on the basis of which they claimed a refund of excess VAT deductions.
In local investigations carried out at the instigation of the SAO of the Slovak Republic, tax subjects failed to prove to the Tax Office the validity of the application of input tax by the relevant documents of the realisation of the imports and the payment of VAT,
- the tax entity (s.r.o.) declared in its tax return for the January 2003 tax year the taxable transaction received in the value of 77 167 576 Sk, the export of goods in the value of 18 006 041 Sk, and claimed an excess VAT deduction of 17 157 101 Sk.
The VAT returns filed for 2003 show that the difference between the volume of purchases and exports of 59 161 535 Sk, which arose in January 2003, was not compensated during the whole of 2003.
In the above cases, the SAO requested the competent tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the excess VAT deductions applied.
- in another case, the tax entity (s.r.o.) for the tax year January to June 2002 declared exports of goods worth a total of 87,199 Sk in VAT returns.
A verification in the SR customs database revealed that the taxpayer had exported a statistical value of 296 747 Sk. during that period.
The Tax Office carried out multiple local investigations at the company's headquarters, finding that the company's manager (a UK citizen) had travelled and the company had left the rented premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.
At the time of the audit of the SAO, the tax administration filed a report to the law enforcement authorities on the suspicion of a crime of non-payment of tax.
Based on the results of the audit at selected tax offices, the SAO finds that the biggest problems in the administration and control of VAT and SpD were mainly in the following areas:
- non-use of the option to carry out a VAT tax check on problematic tax entities, in particular in cases where a high value of excess VAT is applied;
- Tax control protocols did not include an inventory of the documents checked
- JCD on the import and export of goods,
- Insufficient verification of declared imports and exports of goods in tax returns;
- the lengthy procedure for tax administrations to make decisions, in particular in the context of the assessment procedure, even with the consequence of forfeiting the right to impose penalties;
- Failure to comply with legal conditions when granting tax deferrals;
- non-recovery of VAT arrears within the VAT excess refund deadline;
- underutilisation of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.
Based on the audit of the observed shortcomings, the SAO of the Slovak Republic asked the competent tax authorities to carry out a VAT tax audit focusing on the legitimacy of the claimed excess VAT deductions of 14 tax entities.
Measures have been taken at all audited tax offices to remedy the weaknesses identified, the implementation of which will be monitored and checked by the SAO.
6. Conclusion
International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions made between trading partners from both countries and has highlighted deficiencies in the record of imports and exports.
Furthermore, the inspections resulted in the detection of persistent deficiencies in the compliance of VAT payers and SpD, in the activity of the financial and tax authorities respectively, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs administrations, which ultimately reduced the efficiency and effectiveness of tax controls.
The lessons learned also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the customs database of the Czech Republic under the tax information system. In the SR, there is no similar system for the transmission of information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administrations.
The procedure for verifying the performance of the VAT administration and SpD was not the same, given the different legislation and conditions in the territory of the two States.
The SAO verified the necessary data from information obtained with the Czech Customs Administration and from documents available at audited tax offices. The SAO of the Slovak Republic verified the execution of commercial transactions from documents of tax entities requested through the tax authorities.
If irregularities were found, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax checks.
Parallel VAT and SpD controls carried out assessed the state of administration of these taxes in the run-up to accession to the European Union and pointed to the need for further cooperation in this area.
Mutual cooperation will be further enhanced in monitoring the activities of financial and tax authorities in the context of the adoption of the new VAT law.
One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of a so-called recapitulative statement.
This report must be made by all VAT payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.
Tax administrators are required to enter the data from the recapitulative statements into the VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) system, to which tax administrators from the Member States of the European Union have access.
The financial or tax authorities then have the possibility to compare this data with the data contained in the submitted VAT returns.
This system is further used to verify the validity of VAT registration number of persons, verify the validity of the VAT exemption applied on the supply of goods to another Member State and check the proper taxation of the goods.
The implementation of parallel control actions showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic.
The results of these control actions will confront the outputs of the control actions being prepared, which will inter alia focus on examining the VIES system to prevent tax evasion in so-called 'intra-Community supplies'.
Given the importance of VAT and SpD for budgetary revenue, the need to focus control activities primarily on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion on indirect taxes.

1. Introduction
The migration of the population is one of the phenomena that are global in nature and have become an integral part of the current development phase of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
It is mainly due to the flight of citizens from their country of origin or last place of residence from persecution, in particular for reasons of race, religion, nationality, politics, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.
Their aim is to gain asylum and integration into society, especially in some of the advanced democratic countries of Europe.
Foreigners are also a large group, driven by unfavourable economic and living conditions.
Migration is not a new phenomenon.
The adoption of the 1951 Geneva Agreement and the 1967 New York Protocol on the Status of Refugees, both of which the governments of the signatory countries have pledged to apply in their foreign-policy orientations, has already established specific principles for helping refugees.
The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.
Both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue after the split in 1993 by continuing to implement adopted international documents, and their binding nature under national legislation was confirmed by a legal act.
Both republics have also enshrined the granting of asylum in their constitutional laws.
Parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the NajHigher Audit Office of the Slovak Republic were focused on the asylum process and related issues, the results of which are included in the joint final report.
Cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the two countries was carried out on the basis of the "Control Cooperation Treaty" (the "Treaty") concluded in April 2004.
The two Parties have undertaken in the Treaty to provide each other with information on the legislation governing asylum procedures in the State of the other Party, selected statistics on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.
The aim of the parallel control action was to identify the same problem areas and to highlight the consequences of this for the area of population migration.
Cooperation consisted in the unification of the programme of control actions, the exchange of information within the scope set out in the Treaty and the drawing up of a joint final report on the outcome of controls.
The first joint meeting, which took place from 5.4 to 7.4.2004, set out identical sets of controlled issues and control procedures in the preparation of control actions.
At the second meeting, which took place from 28.6 to 30.6.2004, the common points for the control action programme were specified.
During the third joint meeting, which took place during the audit event from 8.11 to 10.11.2004, there was an exchange of experience on ongoing inspections.
The modalities of the outputs from the controls have been specified and the structure and content of the joint final report, which was drawn up on 14.2 to 17.2.2005 at the last joint meeting, has been provisionally determined.
The checks were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.
In the Czech Republic, inspectors of the Defence and Security Department and selected territorial unions carried out the inspection.
The audited persons were the Ministry of the Interior (MV) and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (SUZ).
In the Slovak Republic, the section of defence, vnútra and štátnych úradov was inspected.
The audited entity was the Migračný úrad Ministerstva vnútra SR (Ministry of Interior).
The audited period was 2001, 2002, 2003 (the audited period).
In some cases, statistics for a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.
2. Review of control results
2.1. Assessment of control activities
The subject of the checks carried out in parallel were: - the asylum process, - the asylum facilities, - the management of the State's funds and assets, - the internal control system.
The mutual exchange of lessons learned between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the NajHigher Audit Office of the Slovak Republic took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of control actions.
This exchange allowed for a more thorough evaluation of the submissions, an analysis of the causes of the identified differences in the safeguarding of the asylum process.
This made it possible to focus on the critical issues affecting the operation of asylum facilities.
Ultimately, this had a positive effect on the quality of the control work carried out.
2.2 Summary of control results
The harmonisation of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union (EU) documents has been the subject of European Commission evaluation reports on the readiness of both countries to join the EU.
Legislation in this area continues after the accession of both countries to the EU with a view to further harmonisation with EU law.
The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants is on a steadily growing trend, with a significant increase in applicants occurring in 2001.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, within the meaning of international agreements, provide financial and material security to asylum seekers.
Both countries' national budgets allocate the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure drawn from the national budget of the two countries is influenced in particular by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the granting or non-granting of asylum, as well as the state of health of the applicants.
The amount of some benefits collected is comparable in both countries.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of participants in asylum procedures.
Asylum facilities provide asylum seekers with accommodation, meals, health care and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies during their stay.
At the same time, courses are organised in leisure activities and the applicants are created the conditions for cultural and sporting enjoyment.
Asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres, as well as integration centres in the Czech Republic.
The cost per stay day depends on the occupancy and amenities of the centre and is comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilised.
In the Slovak Republic, it is projected to increase by almost 1,000 seats in the next two years.
The aim is to create the conditions for applicants, an increasing number of whom are expected to continue to apply the Dublin Convention in the coming years.
In the Czech Republic, the highest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on service security. The crucial expenditure under this heading was expenditure on accommodation and catering for applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, expenditure on healthcare provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service for the protection of asylum facilities.
Expenditure on salaries, payments for work carried out and insurance premiums also accounted for a significant proportion of total expenditure.
In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the security of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by many budget measures addressing legitimate demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, expenditure on materials and services, and expenditure on security services have all contributed decisively to current spending.
The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar deficiencies which did not have a major impact on the financial and asset management of the State.
These were particularly shortcomings in the use of State budget funds, contrary to the purpose for which they were determined by the Finance Act, when current expenditure covered actions having the character of a technical valuation of fixed tangible assets.
The Accounting Act on Inventories and on Non-Compliance with the Chart of Accounts was also breached.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of the state's property when it was left to be used by another person without a contract.
Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the Land Registry data breached the Land Registry Act and breached the Waste Act by leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not the person authorised to handle the waste.
In addition, deficiencies were found in the Slovak Republic in the provision of unduly large advances for electricity and natural gas collection, deficiencies in public procurement and in the management of the state's assets when its record was not sufficiently secured and the method of disposing of unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.
The internal control system has been ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the general binding legislation in force governing the way financial control is carried out.
There were no deficiencies in the written documentation submitted.
Despite some shortcomings identified, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší Audit Office of the Slovak Republic are positive about the process of SUZ and the Ministry in securing services for asylum seekers.
Building on the lessons learned during the inspection, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky note that, despite the significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the respective organisational units of both countries have managed the tasks related to the care of asylum seekers at an appropriate level.
The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.
The results of the inspection were discussed with interested statutory representatives of the relevant organisational units of the state on both the Czech and Slovak sides.
Based on the results of the inspection, we recommend that the positive methodological experience of the inspection is used in other joint control actions within the international cooperation of supreme audit institutions.
3. Legislative framework
In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the subsequent New York Protocol of 1967).
The first legislation was implemented by Act No 498/1990 Coll., on refugees.
In the Czech Republic, Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and Amending Act No 83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been effective since 1 January 2000.
This Act has been amended a total of five times (Act No 2/2002 Coll., Act No 217/2002 Coll., Act No 320/2002 Coll., Act No 519/2002 Coll. and Act No 222/2003 Coll.).
There are currently two other amendments to Act No 325/1999 on Asylum in the legislative process, and the adoption of further amendments will be linked to European legislation.
At the time of law 325/1999 on asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and documents on asylum were political documents in their binding nature.
Already, as part of the adoption of this law, there was an effort to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.
A major change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum issues from the 3rd to 1st pillar, when asylum law became part of Community law from 1.5.1999 under the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This shift has created the need to create appropriate legislation as well, i.e. to create legal instruments in an appropriate binding legal order.
The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.
Key Community Asylum Regulations were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic's accession to the EU and their transposition period at the time of the Supreme Audit Office's inspection, the Czech Republic has not yet expired.
Once implemented in the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of how it has implemented the transposition.
In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of state authorities in the procedure for granting refugee status and determining the obligations of foreigners who have applied for refugee status, or who have been granted temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic, was laid down, with effect from 1 January 1996, by the National Council of the Slovak Republic Act No 283/1995 Z. z., on utechencoch.
Since 2003, the Refugee Act has been replaced by Act No 480/2002 Z. z ‘ on asylum and amending and supplementing certain laws, incorporating the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with Council of Europe Directive 2001/55/EC of 20.7.2001 on minimum standards for providing temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote the balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the resulting consequences.
Following two amendments to Act No 480/2002 Z z., on asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonisation of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU legislation on migration and asylum.
Its important elements include, for example, making it compulsory for asylum seekers to attend a Slovak language foundation course during their stay at the integration centre, appointing a guardian to the courts for non-legal aliens if they are staying in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, allowing applicants to enter into an employment relationship in certain circumstances, as set out in an amendment to the law.
The harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with EU law in the area of migration and asylum process has been assessed in the European Commission's regular reports on the preparedness for the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.
In 2002, the report pointed out that the Ministry's staffing capacity was inadequate, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.
4. Asylum process
In the Czech Republic, matters relating to refugees have come under the jurisdiction of the MoI since 1990.
With effect from 1.1.1996, the MoI established an organisational arm of the state SUZ. This was due to the separation of the state administration's performance in the field of asylum procedure, which is carried out through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the MoI, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.
The task of the SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services for the MV to participants in asylum and asylum procedures.
In the Slovak Republic, the Ministry carries out crucial tasks in the field of asylum process, in particular in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process, to the extent defined by specific regulations.
Priority tasks include issues related to deciding on asylum applications by aliens at stage I of the administrative procedure and the comprehensive operation of asylum facilities in the areas of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security for asylum seekers.
It also prepares concepts for the state's migration policy.
The results achieved in the area of asylum system development in the Slovak Republic over the past years have been significantly influenced by cooperation and support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
A particular benefit was his financial participation in the refurbishment of the Asylum Housing Fund.
UNHCR also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.
4.1 Developments in the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process
The trend in the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.
There was a significant increase in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and in 2003 there was an increase in the number of refugees from Chechnya.
An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic is given in Table 1.
A total of 394 cases were granted asylum in the period under scrutiny, including 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.
A total of 22,731 cases were not granted asylum during the period under review and 22,636 cases were discontinued.
The number of parties on 1.1 includes both those to whom the decision has not yet been issued and those to whom the decision has not been communicated.
Also included are those who have been excused from missing the deadline for lodging an appeal, or who have had a previous decision revoked and not yet issued a new one.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers is a steadily increasing trend.
If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, the figure was 10,358 in 2003.
There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, when 8,131 registered, an increase of 423% on 2000, when 1,556 applied for asylum.
Data on the results of asylum procedures in the Slovak Republic during the audited period are presented in Table 2.
A total of 49 asylum applications were granted during the period under scrutiny and the number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in any given year.
Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.
Asylum procedures were discontinued in a total of 23,088 cases.
The bulk of applicants, by staying away from the asylum facility without a permit, voluntarily left the asylum procedure before it was completed.
More than 82% of the total number of registered applicants in 2002 and more than 94% in 2003.
The length of an applicant's stay in an asylum facility, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.
The Ministry's findings also show that the majority of applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are seeking better living conditions, i.e. so-called economic migration, which has no basis in the documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has also signed up.
In these cases, the asylum system is used for purpose by the applicants.
A request for asylum based on economic grounds, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, is not grounds for asylum.
Such a request should be assessed as manifestly unfounded under the provisions of Article 12(1)(a) of Act No 480/2002 on Asylum, and should be decided within 30 days.
There are still no internationally recognised principles for identifying economic migrants that distinguish them from applicants persecuted in their country of origin and that allow the asylum process to be accelerated.
In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is a transit country in terms of international migration, and the destination countries of migration have been, and remain, Western European states.
After joining the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement determining the State responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).
The Convention prevents multiple purpose-built asylum applications from being lodged in more than one EU country.
Applicants return to the country of first registration after a positive identification in EURODAC.
The Slovak Republic is part of the external border of EU countries, therefore the application of the Dublin Convention may in the next period result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create conditions to stay in the Slovak Republic until a decision is taken on whether or not to grant asylum.
4.2 Drawing on funds
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements and resulting national legislative adaptations.
Both countries' national budgets allocate the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure up to the final decision on granting asylum, as well as their state of health.
The growing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher uptake of statutory benefits for claimants, such as food, pocket money, expenditure on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social benefits.
Some doses selected are comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, during the audited period, meals were 58 CZK per person per day, pocket money was 12 CZK per person per day and 6 CZK per child under 15 years of age.
The cost per asylum seeker per residence day was on average 351 CZK in 2001, 383 CZK in 2002 and 345 CZK in 2003.
In addition to the allowance, asylum seekers housed in residential centres with self-contained cooking and applicants housed in private out of asylum facilities may be granted a subsistence allowance up to the minimum.
Law 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, provides, inter alia, in Paragraph 84, for municipalities to be entitled to a contribution towards the costs incurred in connection with an asylum facility on its territory.
The amount of the allowance was set each year by Government resolutions and during the audited period was CZK 7 per person per day of stay.
At the same time, municipalities are granted an allowance to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.
The amount of the allowance was £120 per pupil per month during the audited period, on condition that in that month the person attended the school for a minimum of 10 days.
In the Slovak Republic, in the controlled period, the diet was 70 Sk per person per day, the allowance was 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child under 15 years of age.
The cost per asylum seeker per residence day averaged 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.
The municipalities in whose territory the asylum facility is located are granted a contribution towards the partial reimbursement of expenses incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and activities of the asylum facility, in accordance with Act No 480/2002 Z. z., on Asylum.
Municipalities have so far made only partial use of the possibility to apply for the allowance, which is set at 1 500 Sk per bed per calendar year.
National legislation in both countries sets a 90-day time limit for issuing asylum decisions from the start of asylum proceedings, while allowing for an extension of that time limit in justified cases.
The most common reason for extending the asylum procedure, which affects the level of state budget expenditure, is the lodging of appeals against decisions not to grant asylum.
In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions were issued between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).
The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of the asylum application (17.61%).
In total, 73% of asylum procedures initiated between 2001 and 2003 were finally decided within one year of their start.
Within two years of the start of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications were finally decided.
In the Slovak Republic, according to the Ministry's data, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum benefit from the statutory possibility of extending the deadline by appealing to the court.
In some cases it was an extension of more than a year and the court proceedings had not been completed at the time of the inspection.
Some benefit in shortening the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of joint working places of the Ministry and the Department of Border and Cudzinecke Policie of the Police Board in reception centres in Adama-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Vsi and in Liptovský Vlachoch, which was approached at the time of the inspection from 1.10.2004.
This envisages simplifying procedures and shortening procedural deadlines between the two arms of the asylum process.
5. Asylum facilities
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the provision of services to participants in the asylum procedure.
Asylum facilities provide asylum seekers with accommodation, meals, healthcare, pocket money and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies during their stay.
At the same time, courses are organised in leisure activities and the applicants are created the conditions for cultural and sporting activities.
5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic
SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is responsible for managing the state's assets in the areas of the reception centre of Vyšní Lhoty, the reception and residence centre of Red Újezd, the residential centres of Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brno, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and the premises of the integration asylum centres of Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brno.
In early 2002, a reception centre was set up in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.
SUZ also operates asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seči, Bruntále, Zbýšov and Kashava, which are operated by a legal entity on the basis of Article 80(3) of the Asylum Act No 325/1999 Coll.
The total accommodation capacity of reception centres is 747 places and the total accommodation capacity of residential centres is 1 977 places.
Reception centres are closed facilities which asylum seekers may not leave until they have completed the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception procedures specified in Act No 325/1999 on Asylum.
Violation of the obligation to stay at the reception centre is classed as a misdemeanour.
Accommodation centres to which asylum seekers come from reception centres are used to accommodate asylum seekers until a decision on their application to be granted or not granted asylum has become final.
Provided that certain conditions are met, asylum seekers are allowed to leave or stay in private.
Asylum seekers have the right to free accommodation, meals, other services and pocket money in the reception and reception centres in which they are reported to be staying, provided that they have tolerated the actions necessary to establish their financial and financial circumstances, and such ratios are such that even partial reimbursement for those services cannot be fairly claimed from them.
Integration asylum centres are used for the temporary accommodation of people who have been granted asylum.
Clients are housed in the centre under an accommodation contract, which is generally concluded for 6 months, with the possibility of extension until adequate housing can be provided for them, or secured by themselves under a state integration programme.
In the integration centre, clients pay all accommodation costs and eat individually.
Persons granted refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.
5.1.1 Cost of asylum facilities
To compare asylum facilities, it was chosen as the most meaningful indicator of the cost per physical day of residence.
It is based on the actual number of people who have actually been provided with the services provided by the asylum facility each day.
In Table 3 and in the graph, establishments operated by SUZs are designated as their own and those operated by legal persons under Section 80 of Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as contracted.
The cost of one day's stay in its own SUZ-operated asylum facility is decreasing as these facilities become more populated. This is because the fixed costs of running the premises are allocated to more asylum seekers.
The total cost of providing services for asylum seekers increases proportionately as the number increases.
In 2001 and 2003, the asylum facilities themselves housed applicants in crisis capacity.
In part of 2003, extra accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds in total) was even used to deal with the capacity crisis in asylum facilities caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.
This capacity was provided through the lease of 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.
Spending per applicant per residence day was then lower in those years.
However, long-term maintenance of high levels of fulfillment of these facilities is not possible.
The risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated demand for the need for increased accommodation should be taken into account.
At the same time, it is not possible to carry out certain repairs, maintenance and investments with full accommodation capacity.
The form of asylum facilities operated contractually allows for the adoption of operational solutions on the capacity of asylum facilities where necessary.
5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic
Asylum facilities are reception centres and residential centres.
The Ministry has in its administration the Adamov-Gbely reception centres, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the Brezová residential centre under Bradlom.
The total capacity of the reception centres is 470 places and the residential centre 100 places.
A growing number of asylum seekers were dealt with by the Ministry by setting up a residential centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Slovak Technical University of Bratislava, with flexible available capacity ranging from 250 to 940 places.
Under the lease agreement, the leaseholder also provides services connected with the operation of the centre.
In this form, the MO addressed its own staff shortages.
The residential centre was also temporarily set up in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160.
Reception centres averaged between 57% and 62% during the audited period; residential centres averaged between 33% and 50%.
Occupancy varied by season and was highest in the final months of the year, when many more asylum seekers applied compared to other months of the year.
Further increases of accommodation capacity of about 450 places will be possible after reconstruction of the centres in Opatovskej Novej Vsi and Vlachoch.
The number of places will increase by a further 550 people following the completion of the centre in Humennom in 2006.
5.2.1 Cost of asylum facilities
Figures for the cost of operating asylum facilities are given in Table 4.
Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another entity providing premises and running facilities, including related activities, is one of the options to safeguard, at reasonable cost, the tasks arising from the asylum seekers' stay in the Slovak Republic.
6. Management of state funds and assets
6.1 Economic analysis
In the Czech Republic, the approved budgeted expenditure of SUZs was increased by 13 budget measures of CZK 103,077,000 in 2001.
Of this, 89 979,000 CZK (87.29%) were earmarked funds. The bulk was intended to deal with the consequences of the Kosovo crisis ($44,538,000) and to provide health care to asylum seekers ($38,870,000).
In 2002, SUZ expenditure was increased by 20 budget measures by CZK 88,362,000.
Of this, 62,282,000 CZK (70.48%) were dedicated funds, the bulk of which (53,200 CZK) was for health care provided to asylum seekers.
In 2003, SUZ expenditure was increased by 14 budget measures totalling CZK 88,078,000.
Of this, CZK 82,000,000 (93.09%) were earmarked funds released from the General Treasury Administration.
The amount of CZK 51,000,000 was for health care provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24,000,000 to deal with the influx of Chechen refugees, and CZK 7,000,000 for a humanitarian evacuation programme for disabled residents of the Republic of Iraq.
An overview of the execution of selected SUZ expenditure during the audited period is given in Table 5.
It is clear from the overview above that the highest proportion of expenditure was spent on service provision.
Spending on purchasing services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total spending.
Excruciating expenses under this heading were expenses for housing and catering applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, expenses for medical care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service to guard the various asylum facilities.
Salary, work-related payments and insurance premiums accounted for a significant proportion of SUZ's total expenditure (23.99% - 24.97%).
Last but not least, purchases of materials accounted for a significant share of SUZs' total expenditure (around 14%), with food purchases accounting for the highest proportion of such expenditure (7.61% ? 9.83% of total expenditure).
In the Slovak Republic, the Ministry's budget management of securing migration policy and the asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures that addressed legitimate demands linked to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
The budget proposal and breakdown in the expenditure section was characterised, in particular in 2001 and 2002, by an imbalance between the IAC's requests, which were based on an increase in the number of asylum seekers and the financing needs of their legal entitlements, and the resources provided, above all, in the main category of current expenditure.
The budget chapter administrator tackled the disproportion during the year with multiple budget measures, increasing the current spending limit by 41.8% in 2001 and by as much as 71.7% in 2002.
An overview of the execution of selected expenses of the Ministry during the audited period is given in Table 6.
Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, ranging from 24.47% to 30.51%, and expenditure on materials and services, ranging from 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure, contributed decisively to current spending.
Spending on security services accounted for more than 10% and from 3.92% to 7.20% on groceries.
Spending on accommodation and catering services accounted for a further significant proportion, ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.
The relatively low share, ranging from 1.03% to 6.25%, was capital spending.
6.2 Shortcomings identified
The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed to some similar deficiencies which did not have a major impact on the management of the state's funds and assets.
These were deficiencies in particular in the following areas: (b) breach of the Accounting Act in the field of inventories and failure to comply with the indicative chart of accounts.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of the state's property, where it was left to be used by another person without a proper contract; Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to Land Registry data breached the Land Registry Act; Leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not the person authorised to handle the waste has infringed the Waste Act.
In addition, deficiencies in the provision of unduly high advances for electricity and natural gas collection, deficiencies in public procurement and in the management of the state's assets were found in the Slovak Republic when its record was not sufficiently secured and the method of disposing of unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.
7. Internal Control System
In the Czech Republic, an internal control system within the meaning of the provisions of Act No 320/2001 Coll., on financial control, was introduced at the SUZ on 1 July 2002, setting out the competencies of the individual employees responsible for carrying out the preliminary, intermediate and follow-up checks.
At the same time, an internal audit system was put in place and an internal auditor of SUZ was appointed.
Each year the SUZ is issued a plan of financial, social and operational technical checks aimed at comprehensively verifying the management of the state's funds and assets in the various asylum facilities managed by the SUZ.
There were 42 management checks in 2002 and 54 in 2003.
In the Slovak Republic, the direct exercise of control activities in the departments and organisations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic in respect of compliance with generally binding legislation and internal regulations is ensured by the Minister's Office of Control.
During the audited period, no check was made on the performance of tasks in the asylum sector.
The Ministry's internal control system is mainly aimed at carrying out preliminary and ongoing financial control according to Act No 502/2001 on financial control and internal audit.
The performance of financial control is also governed by the internal rules of the director of the Ministry.
The material focus of the audit activity as part of the management of the different departments was set out in the annual plan of the IA.
The directors of the union have been designated as responsible for exercising control in this area.
According to the submitted written documentation, no deficiencies were identified.
Since the Decree No 28 of 23 April 2004 of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of the Interior has been obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the Law on Complaints.
The organizational security of this task will need to be completed in the near term.

Without trans-European transport networks, a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe would be hard to imagine.
Quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the standard of living of Europeans.
Creating the conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of people and costs is an important task for government.
This is a very demanding task, both organisational and technical and financial.
Europe's efforts at sustainable mobility are often and hard to compromise with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.
Constructions of transport infrastructure, even with the necessary environmental measures, are financially challenging.
Considerable government procedures and decisions in the preparation and acquisition of transport structures can bring significant savings in public financial resources that can be used in other ways for the benefit of citizens.
One of the roles of the audit institutions is to actively seek deficiencies that have led to lower than achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending on transport infrastructure construction.
The audit institutions should not only draw the attention of the state administration to the shortcomings identified, but recommend measures to improve the situation, for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.
Short Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic) Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as BRH) and the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) carried out parallel checks on expenditure on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (the D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The highways are connected by a border bridge that is co-financed by both countries.
Thanks to cooperation with the SAO, BRH was able to carry out a thorough check of the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.
Based on close cooperation with BRH, the SAO obtained the necessary data on the level of German costs for bridges and tunnels for comparative purposes.
The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract in 2000 for the construction of a border bridge.
Eventually, according to the construction process, the completion date was scheduled for the end of 2006.
However, during the award procedure, the Directorate of Roads and Highways of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the RMD) made errors which led to an extension of the competition period and a reduction of the construction time.
The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than anticipated.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.
As a result, however, the RMD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.
As part of the joint inspection work, bridge prices on the D 8 and A 17 motorways were compared on a per square metre basis for the bridge structure.
Statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high costs per square metre.
Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges with a length of over 100 metres.
The price increase could also be attributed to delays in the procurement process.
When analysing the cost of building the tunnels, the inspectors found that tunnel prices on the D 8 motorway were significantly higher than those of comparable tunnels in the SRN.
BRH and the SAO now have a database on the prices of bridges and tunnels, which they will be able to rely on for future checks on the efficiency of the funds used for transport infrastructure purposes.
For the construction of bridges, both monitoring institutions recommend: standardisation of bridge structures and the use of coupled steel-concrete and special structures only when pre-stressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.
Her team spirit and informality were among the main signs of cooperation.
During the parallel inspection, the controllers shared their specific knowledge and skills.
Introduction
This report reports on the progress and results of the parallel checks of funds spent on the construction of the motorway linking Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The controls were focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure incurred.
Parallel inspections were carried out by BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.
Parallel controls took place in 2005 and 2006.
The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure of approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately €690 million) on the frontier section of the D 8 motorway, which is numbered 0807.
Of this amount, €64 million of European funds (ISPA) was planned to be used.
In addition to the parallel inspection carried out with the SAO, BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.
The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to some €670 million, of which €277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).
The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden - central and southern parts of Eastern Europe - Istanbul.
Highway D 8 runs from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.
Highway A-17 runs from the Czech Republic/Germany border to Dresden.
Border sections of both motorways were under construction at the time of the inspection.
These sections became operational on 21 December 2006.
On the German side, the motorway is thus completed as far as Dresden, while on the Czech side of highway D 8 it is not completed, as section 0805, covering 16.4 km through the Czech Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosicemi, is still in the preparation phase.
According to the plan, section 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of České středohoří.
According to forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, there should be 22,940 vehicles per day on the cross-border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway in 2008.
According to German forecasts, the traffic intensity at the Czech border will total about 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic to link the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 to the common national border by building a border bridge.
Both States are involved in the construction of the bridge, therefore the control of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of the parallel controls carried out by the two control institutions.
Cooperation of BRH and SAO
Since mid-2005, the two supreme audit institutions have discussed working closely together to control the construction of the motorway linking Prague and Dresden.
Both sides had serious reasons for such cooperation:
1.
The SRN is financially involved in the construction of the border bridge.
Its planning and construction rests with the RMD.
Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to inspect this construction project.
2.
The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds had been used cost-effectively in relation to the overall level of costs for bridges and tunnels at D 8.
3.
The SAO needed to ascertain the effectiveness of the expenditure, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, in particular the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of driving on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, the agreement on coordinated control of the D 8/A 17 motorway was signed by the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions on 4 January 2006.
The joint working meetings of the BRH auditors and the SAO took place over the whole of 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.
The meetings addressed current issues and challenges, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the inspection of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.
The continuous exchange of information was a major sign of cooperation.
While BRH did most of the work on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and tendering procedures, the SAO largely prepared a methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels.
The applicable legal standards for government control differ in the way control actions are closed in the two countries.
For these reasons, the two supreme audit institutions drew their own control conclusions on their findings, obtained during their inspections.
This report reflects the results achieved through parallel controls.
The cooperation will end with the signing of the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Border bridge construction
The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed in a 2000 contract on the completion date of the construction of the border bridge, as far as possible, in 2005.
The two sides then agreed to postpone this date until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as investor.
The SRN is financially involved in building the bridge out of 42.13%.
In the period up to 1999, the RMD proposed that the border bridge should have a pre-stressed reinforced concrete structure.
In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the RMD agreed to a bonded steel-concrete structure.
This decision was justified by the reduction of the number of twin pillars from seven to five and the subsequent environmental benefits of such a solution for the valley.
In addition, comparative calculations carried out by the RMD indicated that the braced steel-concrete structure should be a less expensive option.
But there was a mistake in the calculations.
They stated that the new fused steel-concrete structure would be only 397m long.
In fact, it's 5% longer.
During the award of the contract for the border bridge, the RMD made serious errors.
It has not prepared contract documentation that adequately describes the assessment criteria and sub-criteria for the comparison of tenders.
This error resulted in the bid evaluation and evaluation panel and the Director-General evaluating the bids in a subjective and problematic manner.
The unsuccessful tenderer contested the results of the contract procedure.
Subsequent investigations by the Competition Authority led to the contract for the construction contract being signed later than initially calculated.
This meant that the 2004 summer construction season, following the evaluation of the bids, was wasted and the time allocated to construction was reduced.
The construction company agreed to build the bridge in less time, but at a substantial cost increase.
The process offered included the double installation of a bridge top, a change in the structure of the pillars and the establishment and fitting-out of mounting spaces.
In addition, the construction company was unable to procure the type of steel originally proposed by the required deadline.
The new type of steel – at a cost of some €4 million more, which had to be paid in full by the RMD – allowed a reduction in the time taken to implement anti-corrosion protection, which in turn enabled the overall construction time of the border bridge to be reduced.
Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge will increase considerably as a result of the accelerated procedure and other adjustments in financing.
The reduced time allocated to construction work led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.
At present, the net cost amount is around €25.9 million, not taking into account automatic price increases (as of October 2006).
Comparison of bridge and tunnel prices
The two supreme audit institutions carried out an analysis of the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 motorways in order to identify bridges that were priced too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.
The analysis relied on methods of mathematical statistics.
Furthermore, tunnels on D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the SRN motorways (A 71, A 38 and A 4).
There are no similar tunnels on the A 17.
In preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to accurately identify the relevant prices.
The two supreme audit institutions have established the following principles for comparing bridge prices: based on the actual price paid for the bridge, excluding value added tax (VAT rates vary and are subject to change in the Czech Republic and SNR); do not take into account prices for the special foundations of the bridge; convert prices in CZK into € at the European Central Bank rate applicable on 30.12.2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).
Both D 8 and A 17 have bridges of different designs (steel-concrete, pre-stressed reinforced concrete, joined-together steel-concrete and steel) and different sizes.
In order to ensure the homogeneity of the structures examined, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.
Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.
By far the most common type of construction was concrete bridges on both sides of the boundary (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).
The analysis concentrated mainly on this group of bridges, as the size of the population allowed the use of mathematical-statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of results.
Checks found that prices per m 2 of concrete bridges on both D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of bridge construction.
For German bridges, the price's dependence on size was stronger than for Czech bridges (see charts below).
Two concrete bridges at A 17 and four at D 8 have been identified and are priced significantly higher.
A method to detect atypical values in a set of numbers was used to locate these bridges, as well as a regression analysis taking into account the bridge price's dependence on its size (for determining atypically expensive bridges, the standard distance from the regression curve is upwards).
However, information about the atypically high price of those bridges should only be seen as an indication of which bridges need to be targeted.
In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of the high price in each case identified should be analysed.
One such cause may be inefficient administrative action, or environmental requirements or some other plausible reason.
Given that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German ones (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the bridge price on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.
The hypothesis of lower prices for Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labour costs in the Czech construction sector compared to the SRN.
On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges at D 8 are higher than at A 17.
Two possible causes for this have been identified during the joint negotiations:
1.
In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.
Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional firms to take part in the tender.
In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of a contract for part of the motorway route, which is several kilometres long.
Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too big for them.
2.
There is more variability in bridge designs in the CR than in the SRN.
In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge construction is decided long before its construction.
The decision is taken at the time when the RMD submits an application for a territorial decision.
Although the RMD selects bridge types from several variants at this time, economy plays a minor role in decision-making.
A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be reached on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction works market in both countries, which would, however, go beyond this control action.
The border bridge is the most expensive coupled ocelobeton bridge at D 8 and A 17.
In the case of tunnels, it was found that tunnel prices on the D 8 are twice as high as tunnels in the SRN.
However, a comparison of the main construction-technical parameters of the tunnels on the D 8 with the tunnels in the SRN showed no significant difference.
Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the tunnel construction industry in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow general conclusions to be drawn.
Effectiveness and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden-Prague motorway
A separate CR was created in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the concept of development of the motorway network.
The D 8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the national border with Germany.
Section No 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains was to be acquired before the border section No 0807.
The Czech Republic acquires the D 8 motorway under programme financing.
In programme No 327 220 ‘Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – state border of the Czech Republic/SRN” set two objectives for the construction of the D 8 motorway:
1.
improve the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem – a national objective;
2.
improve the connection between Prague and Berlin within the framework of the IV Trans-European Transport Corridor Berlin-Istanbul - an international objective.
According to the programme, the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section No 0807 in June 2007.
It should be added here that the completion date is not identical to the commissioning date.
The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains is now at the stage of an official territorial decision.
Environmental activists have challenged the decision with lawsuits.
There is no final decision on the claims.
It can therefore not be excluded that the section running through the Czech Central Mountains will be completed several years later than indicated in the documentation of the programme.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the date of completion of section 0805 until 2010.
As a result of these facts, the construction of the cross-border section has not achieved the national objective of improving the link between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.
The RMD made an estimate of capital expenditure for the border section D 8 No 0807 and section No 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains in 1999-2001.
The estimate in these capital expenditure included investment costs is about €639 million combined for both Sections Nos 0805 and 0807.
Table 2: Economic Assessment Results (EIRR = Internal Rate of Yield)
All motorways and expressways under consideration open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 18,000 vehicles a day in 2010
All motorways and expressways under consideration open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 22,000 vehicles a day in 2010
All motorways and expressways under consideration open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 25,000 vehicles a day in 2010
An economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and the section through the Czech Central Mountains would be completed in time.
However, at the time of the inspection, it is clear that the section through the Czech Central Mountains will not be opened at the original date.
This will reduce the aforementioned EIRRs.
The cost of both sections, net of VAT, as at 31.12.2005, was €897 million, i.e. higher by 27.4% than the cost level used in the economic analysis in 2001.
However, there is a risk that section 0805 will be run on a different, more expensive route, which would affect the aforementioned threshold of economic viability.
Economic analysis has shown that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable at a traffic intensity of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but a study addressing the issue of bypass routes for the missing section across the Czech Central Highlands calculates a traffic intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, pushing the investment below the threshold of economic viability.
With the higher load of commuter routes for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which was not foreseen in the original economic analysis.
The above mentioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the D 8 border section should have achieved will not be achieved.
Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.
The construction of the A 17 motorway also involved similar cost overruns to those of the two sections on the D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment of the 1992 Federal Road Development Plan for Long-haul Transport, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany projected a cost of about €320 million.
The resulting expense-income ratio was then 4.6.
In the meantime, however, costs have risen sharply to about €670 million, and the cost-benefit ratio has more than halved.
In addition to the parallel inspection carried out jointly with the SAO, BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.
In doing so, BRH found that the relevant State Approval Authority had required an off-road tunnel for Section A 17, third section, which was not needed.
In the course of the inspection, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German road building administration that the tunnel was not necessary.
This resulted in savings that amounted to around €10 million in construction costs alone and €0.15 million in annual operating costs.
Assessing the first section of A 17, BRH found that the construction project had not been properly prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
At the preparatory stage, the Road Construction Authority did not investigate the conditions of the bedrock in the Dölzschen rocks because the site was difficult to access.
This was done only after the tunnel stamping machine had struck the rock.
Tests showed that the rocks were more weathered inside than anticipated during the selection process.
Costly measures such as anchoring, injections and stone-falling protective nets, which cost about €3.3 million, therefore had to be taken.
The Road and Motorway Directorate had to bear the costs not only of other extraordinary operations, such as safety measures in the rocks of Dölzschen, but also of measures that would not have been needed if the construction project had been properly prepared first.
Expenditure of this kind includes costs related to the interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), additional training for drilling staff (€0.5 million) and rising wages and expenditure on goods due to project overruns (€7 million).
The cost overruns thus amounted to some €10.7 million, which was not matched by any value added.
Based on the lessons learned from this and other audited projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter guidance in its supervision of road construction works.
In doing so, the Federal Ministry should give the Directorates of Roads and Highways the necessary incentive to introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and SAO Cooperation fulfilled the purpose of both audit institutions.
BRH gained control knowledge of the preparation, assignment and progress of the construction of the border bridge.
The two supreme audit institutions have built a database of bridge and tunnel prices on which future inspections can rely.
The SAO found that the main construction-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and route of the D 8 motorway do not differ from those of the A 17.
The auditors of the two institutions involved in the cooperation have gained new experience, which they can use for further inspections.

Coordinated control of funds earmarked for financing projects implemented under the Cross-Border Cooperation Operational Programme Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013
INTRODUCTION
The evolving community of the people of Europe is a driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.
So let this community provide the opening word on this joint report by the two supreme audit institutions of neighbouring countries:
"185 million EU citizens (37% of the population) live in border areas.
These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often relics of darker parts of Europe's history.
The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help alleviate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers, and to further help develop the dormant potential of border regions.
The programmes cover different border regions: some cover sea basins, others inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.
Most programmes are bilateral, but some involve more than two neighbouring countries. "
The programmes last for seven years and receive a total of EUR 5.7 billion from the EU budget.
"The programmes include the following activities: repairing and reconstructing cross-border roads, cycling paths and bridges, investing in cross-border waste management systems, health facilities, research centres, flood prevention measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or development of tourist destinations, development of joint services for the local population, advice on employment issues, creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.
Support from the programme is provided on condition that organisations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or SMEs) come together to implement projects that are based on the needs of the border region.
Representatives of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly to decide which projects will be supported.
This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself has come to an end.
Funding is provided on condition that project partners from both sides of the border work together in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four features: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing. "
Within the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.
Key attributes of the partnership include: joint choice of lead partner, joint project preparation and application, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, taking overall responsibility for project implementation by the lead partner, overall support payments being accepted by the lead partner and transferred to the respective project partners.
Eligible projects carried out on the territory of the districts and voivodships adjacent to the common border may be supported.
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CONTROL
On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic-Republic of Poland 2007-2013 (OPPS ČR-POL).
€258,187,467 has been earmarked for the implementation of the operational programme.
The total included a contribution from European funds (ERDF) totalling €219,459,344 (85%), which must be spent by the end of 2015.
Financial data on the uptake of EU funds from the Cross-Border Cooperation Operational Programme Czech Republic-Republic of Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 are presented in the table below:
The agreement on cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both authorities on 27 February 2013, following previous mutual meetings at the meeting of the heads of supreme audit institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia, which took place in Lovasberény, Hungary, in September 2012.
The aim of the cooperation was to check that the implementation of the operational programme was carried out in accordance with the legislation and with binding programming documents or agreements, that the management and control system was functioning reliably, that the objectives of the operational programme were being achieved and that the projects selected were being implemented in accordance with the conditions laid down for the aid granted.
This co-operation took the form of a parallel control, in which the supervisory authorities, on the basis of their legal mandate, independently examined topics the content of which had been jointly discussed beforehand.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The audit carried out also included elements of a performance audit.
The selected topics were examined on a sample of projects with project partners on both sides of the border.
The checks carried out resulted in audit findings published in the usual way by both authorities.
This joint report is based on the two control conclusions set out in the Annex.
The selected common control sample included six projects (Annex 1) which fall within the support area 1.1 — Strengthening transport accessibility and the support area 2.2 — Promoting tourism development.
Prior to the start of the audit, the uptake of funds from these two areas of support represented more than 60% of the funds reimbursed to beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all projects implemented under the entire OPPS ČR–POL.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In addition to the control of a common sample of six projects, the SAO audited a further 13 projects and NIK audited two others (all from support areas 1.1 and 2.2).
The funds paid to beneficiaries of the ERDF, which were audited by the SAO and NIK, totalled €25,362,174 (SAO) and €8,450,784 (NIK).
The audited volume represented 41% of all funds paid to beneficiaries from aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.
MAIN CONTROL CONCLUSIONS
Both inspections carried out independently by the SAO on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of irregularities identified did not exceed the level of materiality.
Implementation of OPPS ČR–POL, covering the operation of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.
The auditees who were part of the management and control system took steps to limit the risk of misuse of funds and under-use of ERDF funds.
Proof of the effectiveness of the projects implemented under the operational programme is the high level of achievement of the objectives set, which was also supported by the results of the survey of the social evaluation of project implementation.
SUMMARY OF CONTROL RESULTS
A. Evaluation of management and control system
The coordinated approach made it possible to carry out a check of the OPPS ČR–POL management and control system implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry for Local Development of the Czech Republic), the national coordinator (Ministry for Local Development POL) and the controllers (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodship).
At the same time, the coordinated audit allowed for the evaluation of the tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.
During the evaluation of the management system, the audit focused on the activities carried out in relation to the set-up and performance of the functions of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in relation to the setting of the objectives of the programme and the monitoring of the progress made, the evaluation activities and annual reports, the assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, the absorption of programme funds and the fulfilment of the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies, the control activities of the managing authority, the set-up of the performance of activities and outputs from the audits of the entrusted body and the system for reporting and monitoring irregularities and compliance with it, while the coordination of the OPL was examined.
Furthermore, the activities of the competent authorities in the area of risk analysis and establishment of control plans at the site of project execution were examined and evaluations of project applications carried out by independent evaluators were assessed.
The examination of the control system included a review of the administrative and on-the-spot checks that allowed the approval of e.g. supplies of goods and co-financed services, the eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement, while the compliance of the disbursement of these funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.
Significant shortcomings were found by the SAO audit in the publication of correct, complete and up-to-date information on the subsidies granted.
In the area of project evaluation and approval, a risk of non-transparency of the process has been identified.
Other weaknesses were found in the setting of monitoring indicators and in the setting of the reporting system for irregularities.
Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and management system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.
The irregularities identified by NIK, which related to the operation of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of applicable laws and rules, were not assessed as significant.
These irregularities only had an impact on individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the entire OPPS CR-POL.
Despite the identified discrepancies, NIK assessed the functioning of the system positively.
B. Evaluation of project results
The audit did not show a discrepancy between the indicators and targets set for individual projects and those defined by the operational programme.
In all the projects audited, the expected results were achieved, the funded activities were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operational programme were met.
The audit conclusions are in line with the outcome of the Social Assessment of Project Implementation survey described below.
An important aspect that the SAO and NIK paid attention to in their conclusions is the limited possibility of an objective evaluation of the performance of the anticipated results of individual projects, taking into account both the objectives of the individual projects and the objectives of the entire operational programme.
On initiative The Supreme Audit Chamber conducted an opinion poll conducted in the summer of 2013 at the site of the implementation of projects selected for the common control sample.
The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).
In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the survey was carried out on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both to the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project carried out by Polish project partners and to the Czech public in relation to the part of the project carried out in the Czech Republic.
The survey covered in particular the suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and social function of projects including investments made.
The number of respondents per project is given in Annex 2.
An assessment of the survey responses indicated that the overall social rating of the projects was good, reaching 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), meaning that project results were viewed positively by the majority of respondents both in terms of objectives and other parameters mentioned in the project applications.
According to respondents, the projects examined fulfilled the criteria expressed in the operational programme.
Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments in improving the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and re-establishing contacts between residents of the border region.
On the other hand, the overall assessment of responses indicated a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of objectives/parameters (actual impact rate) and the level expected by respondents.
This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.
The results of the survey were in line with the views of the participants in the panel discussions (focus groups) carried out as part of NIK's control on the Polish side, who pointed to the need to implement the projects and confirmed their positive public acceptance and delivery of the expected results.
C. Evaluation of legality of audited projects
The beneficiaries were checked for the consistency of the substantive and time execution of the project with the project application schedule and content, the fulfilment of the set objectives and purpose of the project, the fulfilment of mandatory monitoring indicators, the management of changes in the projects, the handling of potential project revenues, the fulfilment of the obligation to keep a separate accounting record of project transactions, compliance with the ban on project funding from other EU sources, the implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its terms and conditions, the fulfilment of mandatory publicity relating in particular to the dissemination of the sources of EU project funding, compliance with the conditions for eligibility of project expenditure, the selection of contractors and the verification of deliverables delivered.
The total financial value of the deficiencies qualified by the SAO and NIK as expenditure ineligible for EU funding was found to be €85,094.
However, that amount did not exceed the established level of materiality relating to the total audited volume of funds for the sample of projects.
Despite the irregularities found, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of the selected projects positively by the beneficiaries.
In most cases, commitments under the terms of the aid were duly met by the beneficiaries.
The funds intended for the implementation of the audited projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.
However, seven of the eight beneficiaries audited by NIK were found to be irregular in the implementation of substantive and financial obligations.
These were individual cases of a non-systemic nature and concerned particularly inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breaches of public procurement rules, but did not affect the choice of contractor or the delivery of contractually agreed works.
In only one of all projects audited by NIK, an irregularity found to relate to non-compliance with reporting obligations may qualify as ineligible expenditure, amounting to PLN 43 003 (of which €8 231 funded by the ERDF).
On the other side of the border, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure of CZK 2 098 053 in three of the 19 audited projects (of which €76 863 was funded by the ERDF).
Irregularities included a failure to deliver the materials and works paid for or an expense for the modernisation of a property owned by a person who was not linked to the project either as a beneficiary of the aid or as a project partner.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The joint recommendation of the SAO and NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system in particular with regard to the consistent setting of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.
In general, efforts must also be made to establish such indicators at both programme and project level that allow more reliable verification of the implementation of the identified impacts.
Comments and recommendations from checks carried out on both sides of the border are included in separate audit conclusions of the SAO and NIK on the CD.

Public works procurement and corruption prevention
Joint report on parallel audit by Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)
Introduction and Overview
Procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and private sectors.
The role of the state is to use public resources as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.
In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor for the success of the single economic area.
In its regulations, the EU has set limits above which contracting authorities must meet certain requirements to guarantee a broad and unrestricted competitive environment across the EU.
EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.
Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.
For public contracts below EU thresholds, the regulation of their award remains the responsibility of individual countries.
Moreover, public procurement is vulnerable to corruption, with consequent high potential for harm.
Therefore, contracting authorities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to avoid corruption and unfair favouritism (prevention of corruption).
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - NCA) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to conduct parallel checks in the field of procurement procedures and prevention of corruption in land and transport structures.
Cooperation was also focused on the field of European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.
Controls included awarding contracts below European limits in order to crack down on corruption prevention.
The inspection findings of the two supreme audit institutions are summarised in a joint report addressed, inter alia, to international organisations such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Areas of control and audited institutions
The BRH assessment is based on blanket inspections of the above-mentioned areas, which were carried out at the German construction administrations in charge of federal transport and land structures between 2011 and 2012.
For example, motorway works and large-scale building projects were assessed.
BRH included findings from past inspections in the evaluation.
The SAO's assessment is based on inspections carried out during the years 2008 to 2012, which focused on construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, federal procurement is mostly carried out by the Land's building authorities.
In the Czech Republic, the state institutions for road and rail construction are responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure contracts.
In the field of building, procurement is carried out by entities benefiting from budget funds.
In both countries, the services of external experts are also used at each stage of the procurement process.
The evaluation must take into account the differences in procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in both countries.
Structure of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the conduct of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and sub-statutory standards.
Procurement procedures limited to Germany shall be governed by budgetary law and relevant administrative acts .
The internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.
Further details on the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are set out in the federal government's so-called procurement manuals, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail, taking into account legal precedents in the field of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation concerning contracts with a value above and below European limits.
The procurement law was substantially changed in 2012.
The new rules have strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened up scope for more competition and reduced opportunities for corruption during the procurement process.
Essential aspects of procurement law in both countries
As far as European procurement procedures are concerned, open and narrower procedures in particular need to be applied in both countries.
In Germany, contracts below the European limit are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, restricted call for competition, negotiated procedures), but these are practically identical to the above-mentioned conditions for European procurement procedures.
Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates on a European scale are invited) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).
In open procedures and when invited to take part in a contest, a tender may be submitted by any interested party.
Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized firms.
This is achieved primarily by dividing the total procurement into business-specific lots and dividing into sub-contracts.
The award of contracts divided into these lots gives as many candidates as possible a chance to participate in the procedure.
The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-tested tools for getting good value for money.
There are more than 330,000 construction companies registered in Germany with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, the terms of European procedures must be applied even in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.
The exception is the simplified sub-standard procedure, where the contracting authority can apply less onerous procedures.
In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.
Current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between an open procedure and a narrower procedure.
There are 85,000 construction companies registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.
Total procurement volume of public works by contracting authorities and proportion of each type of procedure in both countries
In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany amounted to EUR 7 675 billion.
CZK 1,138 billion (15%) of which was the share of public contracts that included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities, in addition to those awarded by the federal government.
The total volume of federal road and land construction projects (excluding construction of railways and water structures) amounted to CZK 212.5 billion.
In 2011, the composition of the federal land works and transport works contracts was as follows: 80,7 % open procedures and public calls; 12.7% narrower governance and challenges;
6,6 % negotiated procedures and direct awards; 33.2% is the proportion of European procurement procedures.
The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic reached 118.6 billion CZK in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.
In 2009 it reached CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37% of the total.
Structure of procurement types in 2011: 65.1% open procedures; 14,3 % restricted management; 9,5 % negotiated procedure; 8,4 % simplified procedures for sub-standard contracts; 2.7% other management.
The figures include all supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.
These figures show that: parallel controls in both countries targeted a substantial proportion of public procurement procedures; prevention of corruption, which must be kept in mind in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open significance. procurement procedures are of key importance.
Summary of main results
The SAO and BRH carried out parallel checks on the award of European works contracts, with an emphasis on preventing corruption in their countries.
The inspections focused on comparing legislation in the two countries and the EU and on the implementation of land and transport procurement contracts.
The following are the key findings:
The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national laws of both countries (points 1 and 3.1).
Preventing corruption is not only the aim of the EU directive, but of the two countries' national procurement rules, which differ in part in both focus and detail.
In both countries, the basic requirement that tender documents must meet is to include all the information needed to prepare tenders.
The specification shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements restricting competition.
Tender documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the problem is the lack of definition of the subject matter of the contract.
In Germany, splitting contracts into lots is required where possible in order to promote a competitive environment.
According to BRH's findings, this requirement is respected in Germany.
The SAO's inspections showed that in the Czech Republic considerable public works in the field of roadworks are commissioned without being divided into parts or being divided, but only into very significant parts in volume. This may distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.
These limitations on market potential can result in significant cost increases and create the risk of non-serious price negotiations and impermissible conventions.
Legislation in both countries allows contracting authorities to award additional works under certain conditions if the need arises after the contract has been concluded (point 4.1).
In both countries, the requirements for correctly determining the type of procurement procedure are met.
In the Czech Republic, under the applicable regulations, contracting authorities are free to designate one of the open procurement procedures, namely an open procedure or a restricted procedure.
German procurement and budgetary law enshrines the primacy of open procedures for both European tenures and national ones, known as public calls for competition.
Open tender procedures in both countries allow a larger range of candidates to submit a bid and also reduce the risk of corruption by making it more difficult to collude illegally between bidders.
At the same time, the best results in terms of value for money are being achieved.
In the case of large contracts for which the estimated total price reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, the audited contracting authorities always launched a European procurement procedure.
Correct determination of the estimated contract value plays a very important role in determining the type of procurement procedure.
In Germany, databases are used to determine the price of public works objectively, in which values are based on completed construction projects.
This is a sufficiently objective tool.
In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the area of road construction, but are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).
When awarding a works contract under European procurement procedures, prior information and contract notices need to be published in order to enhance competition by allowing candidates to prepare in time for the submission of tenders.
As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.
In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).
There is a greater risk of manipulation when selecting candidates to participate in a restricted procurement procedure.
Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee genuine competition.
Selection criteria shall be objective, non-discriminatory and published sufficiently in advance.
Beyond EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should as often as possible rotate candidates who invite participation in the procedure when selecting suppliers.
In Germany, there are in part very detailed requirements to prevent the risks of manipulation.
In some cases, the audited contracting authorities did not follow these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (point 4.4).
In both countries, contracting authorities must ensure during the procurement process that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.
Any agreements between these candidates, and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications, must be avoided as far as possible, so as not to restrict competition through unlawful agreements.
In Germany, the measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited German contracting authorities did not meet this requirement in several cases (point 4.5).
In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.
Labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality requirements are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (paragraph 4.6).
The assessment and evaluation of bids is regulated procedurally in both countries.
The relevant German measures are more comprehensive, but have not always been respected by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities passed on their tenders to third parties for inspection without prior assessment, without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.
Thus, offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (paragraph 4.7).
For the purposes of legal protection, the participants must be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.
This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corruptive action.
The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.
Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).
The tender documentation was not always complete or fully credible for the audited contracting entities in both countries.
In the case of several procurement procedures, transparency requirements applied at European level were not always properly respected in the minutes of the procedure.
In addition, some of the weaknesses identified reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the dossier.
Contracting entities in both countries mostly complied with their reporting obligations (paragraph 4.9).
Summary of the main principles of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption
European tender law
In order to ensure free competition in the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, a Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts to ensure the free movement of goods and services, and a Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to review procedures for the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (the Remedies Directive), both of which were to be transposed into national law.
The general EU procurement principles include in particular: a requirement for a competitive environment; a requirement for equal treatment or non-discrimination; a requirement for transparency.
EU procurement principles include the Directive on the Coordination of Public Procurement Procedures in addition includes provisions for construction projects with a total foreseeable value of over €5 million.
These provisions shall affect: the content of the procurement documents; type of procurement procedure used; disclosure of certain information before, during and after proceedings; compliance with the deadline for the receipt of tenders; the qualification requirements that may be required of tenderers; the criteria for selecting the most suitable tender.
The legal protection of candidates is governed by the Remedies Directive.
In the event of a potential breach of procurement law, tenderers may have the contracting authority's decision reviewed in accordance with the review procedures.
Both countries transposed EU requirements into national legislation.
Preventing corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
There is no legal definition in either country of what corruption actually means.
Corruption is widely understood as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position for its own benefit.
As a rule, this means that such abuse is encouraged by those benefiting.
Corruption can be an obstacle to competition and can cause serious economic losses.
Total corruption-related damages are estimated to account for 5% of the world's economic output.
For the EU, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.
Where a contracting authority is involved, agreements restricting competition or allowing dishonest conduct may undermine confidence in the integrity, ability and overall work of the public administration.
That is why preventing corruption is an essential task for contracting authorities.
Practice and procedures must be scrutinised, particularly in areas particularly vulnerable to corruption, so that adequate measures can be taken to prevent it.
Taking preventive action and carrying out effective controls can substantially reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.
As a rule, the award of works contracts is considered to be an area particularly vulnerable to corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, with particular regard to active and passive bribery, receiving and offering significant benefits.
The German federal government has issued a manual of recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration, according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process outside of risk analysis: preference for open procurement; principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; separation of planning, procurement and accounting phases; accurate and complete tender documentation.
In addition, other measures having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of procurement law.
In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology introduced a system to monitor procurement for the construction of federal roads.
Using this system, data such as estimated costs, total contract value and the involvement of private design offices can be fully recorded and analysed to identify any discrepancies.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, and the level of labour or civil law is also an option.
The legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of preventing corruption.
Anti-corruption measures in this area were set out by the government in the "Government's Anti-Corruption Strategy 2011-2012" which was updated for 2013 and 2014.
Some of these measures have been incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and subsequent implementing legislation.
The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering the thresholds for small-scale contracts; the obligation of prior notice by the contracting authority, including the justification for the contract; the prohibition on limiting the number of tenderers in a restricted procedure and the abolition of the general possibility to limit the number of tenderers by drawing lots; obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors.
Results of controls related to subsequent stages of procurement
Tender Documentation
Tender documents shall contain all information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their tenders in an appropriate manner.
The documentation shall, in particular, allow for the processing of the offer price.
In order to do so, tenderers must not be exposed to risks they could not have anticipated.
The tender dossier shall contain, in particular, specifications, as well as requirements to prove the qualifications of the tenderers and criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.
The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption
In particular, European law contains requirements relating to technical specifications.
The specifications must limit competition as little as possible and all interested parties must have equal access to them.
Specifications must be neutral.
Requirements for specific specific products are permissible on a very limited scale in procurement documents.
The basic principle of preventing corruption is that the tender documents do not contain requirements that could restrict competition.
Furthermore, documentation should avoid ambiguities or inaccurate data that create scope for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.
The basic principle is that specifications should be given generally without reference to a specific product or brand.
The specifications must specify the deliveries and services required and detail the numbers of units of work and deliveries.
In normal cases, prices should be indicated by units of work or supply (e.g. in CZK/m or CZK/item).
It is permissible to define the work required in terms of functionality only in exceptional cases.
In principle, the rule is that specifications must be drawn up completely and unambiguously.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include works and supplies, the necessity of which is not obvious.
Reimbursements in the form of lump sums or according to time worked should be avoided where possible.
These parts of the tender dossier must exclude speculation and manipulation, based on ambiguous specifications.
The specifications must allow each bidder to prepare its bid with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender shall not be published until the tender dossier is complete.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation for contracting authorities to award construction contracts in lots.
A procuring entity may divide a procurement into several separate lots if the nature of the subject of such a procurement so permits.
In Germany, the application of the rule of dividing works into parts is required, either quantitatively (sub-deliveries) or according to special considerations (specialised parts of the contract).
This allows SMEs to participate in the competition, increases the number of potential bidders and makes price fixing more difficult.
This type of procurement is usually considered the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.
In the Czech Republic, tender documents must contain evaluation criteria in national and European procurement procedures.
In doing so, the tenderer should be comprehensively and exhaustively informed of the criteria by which its tender will be evaluated.
In Germany, the requirement to indicate the evaluation criteria in the notice applies only to European invitations to tender.
In national procurement procedures, evaluation criteria need only be included in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.
When the tender documents are prepared by authorised independent experts, German law requires excluding from them any information that would assist in identifying the specific firms, architects or designers involved.
This is to prevent individual construction firms from obtaining, without the knowledge of the contracting authority, any additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contacts with these independent experts.
This is why independent experts are not allowed to publish documents relating to tenders and make them accessible for screening.
The contracting authority is the sole point of contact for the construction companies.
The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.
In the case of major construction projects, there is almost always a need for additional works or modifications to existing works after the initial contract is concluded.
Legislation in both countries allows a multi-work contract to be awarded within a certain limit to the same contractor without the need to publish and conduct a new procurement procedure.
The volume of additional works under both European and German legislation may not exceed 50% of the original contract value.
In addition, additional works must be necessary and must be of a specific nature as part of the main contract.
In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied to the award of additional works.
This may entail the risk of a greater time lag in the execution of the contract and the eventual incorporation of a new entity into an already running project.
Where a multi-work contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision which prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified works or multi-works.
Calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.
In addition to multiple works, there may be inferiorities in construction, i.e. work that was not needed.
In the Czech Republic, inferiority and multiwork cannot be compensated for each other.
Main control findings
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In rare cases, specifications have referred to national technical requirements or standards, but these have in the meantime been replaced by EU standards.
In some cases, the specifications included data requiring a specific brand name, e.g. for a public sign resistance system, for preventing water ingress or for anti-noise cladding, although this was not necessary.
In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.
Quantity specifications broken down into items
BRH did not detect, in a single case of checking procurement procedures, a non-conformity with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supplies and services under the quantity specifications broken down into items.
Completeness of specifications
In most of the cases audited, tender documents were fully drawn up before the call for tenders was launched.
In various cases, however, documents had to be modified during the procurement process when changes in the items or timing had to be taken into account.
In rare cases, the tender documents included works and supplies whose need was uncertain.
One tender dossier for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.
Division of contract and award criteria
In many cases, the required justification not to split deliveries into lots has not been demonstrated.
BRH did not find any shortcomings in the tender evaluation criteria prior to the award of the contract.
Include Names of Authorized Independent Experts
Many of the documents mentioned interested authorized experts.
Names were included on the front pages of the documents or on the plans or attached opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact an explicitly appointed architect with their questions on the procurement procedure.
For building projects, these cases were found mainly in tender documents, where self-employed experts were entrusted with drawing up the specifications.
The contracting authorities indicated that they did not have sufficient staffing capacity to scrutinise tender documents in detail.
OWN
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 apartments, the reference was directly to specific manufacturers and product brands.
The contracting authority did not admit the use of other similar types of products or justify why it required the supply of specific products.
In the case of the construction of a university facility, the tender documents contained references to specific commercial firms and specific product designations.
Overview of specifications and sub-specifications
In the case of the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define in the tender documents the quantity and type of works, supplies or services required in the statement of assessment and established only the enclosure in cubic metres for each building as the unit of measurement.
Completeness of specifications
During the procurement procedure for the construction of the road circuit, the tender specifications for the restricted procedure were amended four times between August and September 2009.
This was due to changes in the project documentation due to an extension of the scope of the contract and a change in the technical conditions.
In the case of the construction of social objects, the tender documents had defects which forced the creation of multiple works (lack of precise focus, insufficient technical research in the construction, absence of drawings).
In the tender documents for the construction of the large library, the interior elements were listed only descriptively, with no specification of quality requirements for the products.
The supply of interior fittings was provided by subcontractors who purchased some premium and very expensive equipment.
Parts and contract award criteria
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to award the contract in lots.
An analysis of three major roadworks under construction of the road circuit showed that when they were awarded in open procedure in lots (separately after selected objects), savings of up to CZK 790 million could be made from the achieved price of public contracts of CZK 15,508 million.
For example, by awarding six building sites as a separate part of the public contract, a saving of EUR 62.5 million could have been achieved.
A saving of CZK 287.8 million, i.e. also 25%, could be achieved by awarding 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract.
The contracting authority had set qualification criteria in the tender documents for the construction of the roads, limiting the participation of small contractors in the tender procedure.
In the tender specifications for an open tender for a contractor for one construction of a motorway, the contracting authority requested, among other things, the contractor's practice of carrying out at least three roadworks with a financial volume of more than CZK 700 million each, completed or put into service over the last five years.
There are only nine firms in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completing buildings over 700 million CZK in the last five years.
The open tender for the delivery of another motorway construction covered six separate works for which the contracting authority required a minimum annual volume of works of EUR 12 billion over the last three years.
Two-thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. €2.5 billion out of €3.7 billion) in the period of 2008-2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually in form of consortium.
For 46 contracts for a total of 13.2 billion CZK, there were only two or even one bidder.
The SAO pointed out that limiting market potential can lead to large cost increases.
Multiwork Area
The contracting authority, when constructing the road circuit, did not, in two cases, conclude a written contract for the supply of the additional works and did not award the additional works by any of the procedures specified in the Act.
The value of pre-approved multi-work in one case was CZK 1,591.4 million excluding VAT (an increase of 21%) and in the other case CZK 4,135.8 million excluding VAT (an increase of 91%).
The reason for the extra work was mainly the ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.
In the case of the construction of a university facility, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documents certain works and supplies of which it was aware at the time of the award of the contract that it needed to complete and validate the construction.
For those works and supplies, he concluded amendments to the works contract with the builder with an increase in price, in a negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of additional works exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.
In the context of the construction of the Justice Palace, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a procurement procedure.
During the construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by CZK 50.5 million.
Unit prices for additional works determined without competition were significantly higher than comparable works performed by the same contractor.
Other findings
The SAO found on a selected sample of buildings that the average construction cost of building one kilometre of a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic is CZK 355.0 million.
According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometre of a four-lane motorway is CZK 260.0 million.
This comparison suggests that acquiring a motorway in the Czech Republic is more costly than in Germany.
Summary
The legal provisions relating to procurement documents are almost identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of European law.
The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and the prevention of corruption.
Specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow interested parties to calculate costs and prepare their bids.
Moreover, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to commission additional works.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions on tender documents are supplemented by additional rules to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for carrying out manipulations.
Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, greater transparency is achieved through the publication of award criteria.
Specification requirements are mostly met in both countries.
In some cases, however, shortcomings have been identified that could lead to a reduction in competition.
The current rule in Germany requiring bulky construction projects to be subdivided into sections seems appropriate for fostering a competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.
The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, awarding contracts for large-scale projects without piecing together or dividing into large-scale parts can limit the range of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.
The result of the strict requirement on bidder references applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of road works bidders is that public contracts are awarded only to a small number of bidders and thus small and medium-sized companies have no chance of competing.
The limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price fixing and other illegal arrangements.
The regulatory approaches in the two countries are different when it comes to awarding and paying for additional contracts for additional works or modified works.
If the value of the additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50 % of the value of the original contract, the additional works may be awarded without a procurement procedure and notice.
In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% applies.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded by contracting authorities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If the 20 % limit is exceeded, additional works must be awarded following a new procurement procedure.
Dividing up the work into parts avoids both the reduction of competition and the consequent ill effects.
Determining the type of procurement procedure with respect to EU limits
By specifying the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the range of potential contractors that will be admitted to the competition.
A procuring entity may leave the scope of potential suppliers unlimited, or may limit the scope according to specified criteria.
A European procurement procedure must be conducted for major project works with a value that exceeds or exceeds the limits set by the EU.
The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption
In choosing the type of procedure, the contracting authority must in particular comply with the requirements of European law relating to the competitive environment and transparency.
If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the works required reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million ($125 million), an open or restricted procurement procedure at European level is always required.
In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue is permitted.
Where a construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may derogate to a limited extent from the European procurement procedure by launching a national procedure if the total value of the relevant part is below the threshold of €1.0 million ($25 million) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the estimated value of the entire contract.
Dividing a construction project or deliberately estimating its cost too low with the intention of avoiding a major obligation to launch a European procurement procedure is not permissible.
Choosing the type of governance is very important for preventing corruption, as reducing competition substantially increases the risk of manipulation.
Therefore, a detailed justification of the type of procedure chosen is an important part of the tender documentation, particularly in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented EU legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits in their national legislation.
Different provisions
The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures as well as for procurement procedures at national level.
Open and restricted procedures can always be chosen, while other types of procedure are only permitted if the conditions laid down by law are met.
Unlike the Czech regulation, the relevant German regulation of budgetary law and the principles of preventing corruption prefer open procedures or a public invitation to take part in the procedure.
Other types of proceedings, including restricted ones, are permitted only exceptionally, where the legislation so permits.
Such exemptions must be justified and documented.
The principle of open procedure preference is intended to ensure that restrictions on competition are prevented to the maximum extent and that the opportunity for manipulation (pre-selected specific candidates) is limited.
In Germany, this principle of public procurement is central to preventing corruption.
A correct estimate of the expected contract price is an important basis for deciding on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.
In estimating the costs of building projects, contracting authorities in Germany can rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.
These have been compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for types of construction, construction units, building parts and sub-construction works.
On the basis of such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the contract value of the planned project or works.
Only a few building administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.
However, the database is expected to be expanded nationally.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects to determine the expected costs of land-based contracts.
In many cases, the determination of costs is based on an estimate by the entity financing the project or based on the value of the resources available to that entity.
Measures for standardisation are still at an early stage.
Under the anti-corruption programme for the period 2011 to 2012, the relevant ministries are to draw up a database of customary prices for standardised commodities.
The use of a price system to determine the expected price of a contract is determined by a new regulation requiring the subject of the contract to be set out in detail.
The pricing system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly works, materials and products and other data to calculate the necessary costs and to establish unit prices.
The Ministry of Transport has issued normative prices for transport works for inspection, which are regularly updated.
The database is designed to price the project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the subsequent stages of the preparation of the works.
Main BRH control findings
Tender Selection
The audited contracting authorities generally awarded contracts through an open procedure or a public call for tenders and thus complied with the requirements of budget and procurement legislation.
In 2011, the share of tenders in the total volume of federal building projects in the field of building construction was 59.5%.
In road construction, the share was 94.8%.
BRH found that in some cases the use of in-camera competition was not adequately justified.
In the case of blanket control, the BRH found, based on information collected from more than 16,000 procedures, that restricted management has a clear disadvantage compared to public management and public challenge, and restricted procedures also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to the BRH study, bidding prices in the restricted procedure and negotiated procedure were 6% to 10% higher than in public procedures.
Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Land Audit Court confirmed the differences in value for money obtained in public and restricted procedures.
Indeed, a study by the Ministry of Construction found that prices in restricted procedures were twice as high as those in public procedures.
Compliance with EU limits
For projects estimated to have a total contract value of more than €5 million ($125 million), the audited contracting authorities generally prepared procurement plans indicating which works would be awarded in the European tender and which in the national tender.
According to the tendering plans, the proportion of works commissioned under European rules was always more than 80% of the total.
There has not been a case of circumvention of the requirement for European governance in the form of an exorbitantly low cost estimation.
However, in some cases the minimum proportion for pan-European management has not been reached due to a calculation error.
In the course of carrying out the works, some contracting authorities have unlawfully changed the contracting plan.
They did not provide any justification for these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of European governance would subsequently be respected.
The share of European tenders by project accounts was generally lower than the share provided for in the procurement plan.
If the expected contract values for construction projects exceeded the European limits, contracting authorities did not apply the European procedure to all individual sub-lots exceeding €1m (£25m).
Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure, without giving good reasons for the need to deviate from the requirement.
OWN
Choose tender type
In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. construction of a road section, facilities for a major sporting event and construction of apartments), the contracting authority divided one project into several lots, although these sub-contracts were of the same or similar nature.
The division reduced the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded under a less demanding regime or even outside the statutory regime.
Methods for calculating the forecast price
The pricing standards applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for setting the expected price.
They were based on prices quoted in the completed proceedings, which were however burdened by both uneconomic and excessive profits for suppliers.
The SAO found that actual prices for three parts of the road circuit were about 37% lower than these price norms.
The Ministry of Transport is to update the standards in relation not only to prices from the past, but also to other comparable markets and price developments.
In the case of ground-based construction, the estimated price was based on the budget of the project carried out by the architects or the investor's estimate.
The actual price then differed considerably from the forecast price.
The projected cost of building a large library was twice as high as the contract price, but it increased by CZK 54 million, or 27%, during the execution.
Similarly, for the construction of a depository for this library, the contract price was 33% lower than forecast.
In other cases, the successful applicant's price was higher than the anticipated price and increased even further in the course of implementation.
For the construction of the large library, it was by 400 million CZK, or 22%. For the construction of the Justice Palace, the actual price increased disproportionately (by 139%) over the increase in functional areas (only by 12%) during the construction process.
Summary
Both countries have implemented European provisions on choosing the type of procurement procedure and respecting European limits in their national legislation, so the respective national arrangements of the two countries are almost identical.
Nevertheless, the principle of public governance in Germany is stricter than European and current national regulations in the Czech Republic.
Compared to a narrower procurement process, a public procedure or a public invitation to participate gives more competitors the opportunity to participate in the procurement process.
These types of procurement generate a large number of bids that guarantee the best value for money effect.
Prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened as the pool of candidates is not constrained by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, thereby allowing room for price manipulation and fixation among bidders.
The studies confirmed the advantages of the German provision on preference for open procedures or public calls for participation.
Czech law allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or restricted procedure.
However, the latest legislation in the Public Procurement Act introduces a ban on contracting authorities limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures.
Closer management has now come very close to open management.
In Germany, contracting authorities are largely fulfilling the requirement of a preference for an open procedure or a public call for competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects have been subdivided in violation of the law, in order to circumvent the requirement to choose the relevant type of procurement procedure.
However, in the case of some projects carried out in Germany, European limits were not respected, which resulted in the minimum proportion not being reached in Europe-wide procedures.
A satisfactory system has not yet been put in place in the Czech Republic to facilitate the correct calculation of the expected costs of construction works and projects.
Where appropriate, contracting entities should ensure, through more extensive controls, that the requirements for the choice of the type of procurement process and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are met, or create the conditions necessary to allow a correct calculation of the expected costs.
Provisional information and notice of initiation
In cases where contracts are awarded under the European procedure, the contracting authority must publish a procurement report.
Preliminary information and contract notices are an important basis for European competition.
The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption
By means of prior information notices, the contracting authority must indicate the basic specifications of the projects envisaged.
Preliminary notices are required for projects where the total cost estimate is equal to or greater than the European limit and where the contracting authority wishes to reduce the time limit for the submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.
A procuring entity is required to publish a procurement notice with detailed information for all procurement that requires a European procedure.
The information shall be binding on the sponsor upon publication.
Among other things, the notice shall contain specifications, time limits for the procedure and for the completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weightings.
A common procurement vocabulary must be used to describe the subject of the contract.
Preliminary information and contract notices are published in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the contracting authority.
To avoid discrimination against foreign candidates, national notices should not contain any additional information and should not be published before the text of the notice is sent to the EU Publications Office.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in advance notifications can distort competition or even ease manipulation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented EU pre-information and tender notices provisions in their national legislation.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, prior information and notices must also be published for contracts for which a European procedure is not required.
Procurement procedures shall not begin earlier than one month after dispatch of the prior information notice.
It is only in exceptional cases that a provisional disclosure can be waived.
In Germany, prior information is not required in cases where a European procedure is not necessary.
In the case of national procedures, the public invitation must be published on the federal government's website and, where appropriate, in the press.
In restricted procedures without competition from participants, a notice must be published if the estimated contract price is equal to or above €25,000 ($625,000).
Preliminary notices must explain all planned parts of the project.
This is an important requirement given the number of small contracts in Germany.
Division of projects into smaller parts is not as common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.
Main control findings
BRH
Advance notice
The contracting authorities published advance notices for the projects, which included works to be awarded in a European procedure.
In some open procedures, they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between the sending of the advance notice and the sending of the contract notice was less than 52 days.
In the case of other abridged procedures, the annual time limits for preliminary information had expired and were to be renewed.
In many cases, the advance notice did not indicate an anticipated split of the construction works into multiple lots.
Tender Notice
Some of the notices contained codes from the Common Dictionary that deviated from the content of the advance notice or did not specify precisely the work to be performed.
In isolated cases, notifications at national level included more information, e.g. on performance dates, or were published before a notice was published in the EU Official Journal.
Ex-ante transparency
One contracting authority hired an outside company to publish a national notice.
It published notices on its platform, the use of which was subject to a fee.
But the contracting authority did not check whether that company had to comply with the requirement to send further notices to a free online government portal.
The sample found that only a third of notifications were actually published on the government portal.
OWN
Tender Notice
In the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not lay down in the notice of a restricted tendering procedure for the works contractor the criteria by which it would reduce a large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure.
The method of selecting (reducing) tenders for evaluation has not been documented by the contracting authority.
Previous legislation allowed for a reduction in the number of bids.
When constructing the road circuit, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice of the opening of the restricted procedure or in the qualification documents the values by which it would assess the level of compliance with the qualification criteria or the number of tenderers to be invited.
The contracting authority assessed the qualification as having been met by all six candidates under the restricted procedure, but excluded one of them as having met in the last sixth place.
The contracting authority's procedure was not transparent as it did not publish in advance information on what qualification data would be evaluated and how.
Publishing calls
For construction works in former military tours, the procuring entity failed to publish a written invitation to tender, in violation of the law.
Conclusions and recommendations/summary
The two-step information process with prior information and the publication of the Notice of Initiation is an important tool for meeting the transparency requirements and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European proceedings.
By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and strengthening this obligation in Germany for restricted procedures, both countries have increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.
Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures
Contrary to an open procedure, restricted procurement procedures do not allow participation by all potential bidders who would be interested.
In restricted procedures, the procuring entity first selects potential suppliers who will be asked to submit a tender.
The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption
EU provisions allow a cap on the number of candidates in European restricted procedures.
However, a restricted procedure requires at least five bidders to be invited to submit a bid and, in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential bidders must be invited.
In any event, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently broad to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria shall be objective and non-discriminatory and published in advance.
The selection of potential candidates to be invited is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. the preferences of some of them.
Reducing competition to a few bidders may ease their collusion.
This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.
Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent tampering and ensure that it has effective control so that the procedure is transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The provisions for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the requirements of the European directive, contracting entities should rotate tenderers invited to submit a tender.
Nor is it permissible to restrict competition from a regional point of view.
Contracting entities must document and justify the selection of candidates and the selection process.
Different provisions
In Germany, it is required to invite at least three candidates in a restricted procedure and several suitable candidates in a negotiated procedure.
Except in two cases, the new Czech regulations do not permit limiting the number of candidates approached in the event of a restricted and negotiated procedure.
In Germany, when selecting candidates, the ‘four eyes principle’ must be respected.
While one worker proposes their list, another must substantially modify the proposal, e.g. by deleting a proposed candidate or installing another.
This is to avoid a situation where an individual can definitively determine the range of candidates who will take part in the procedure.
In the absence of such a provision, far-reaching illegal collusion between the parties is allowed.
The list of tenderers invited to submit a tender must be confidential and may not be divulged.
Authorised independent experts are also obliged to do so.
There is no similar measure in the Czech Republic, nor any measure for confidential treatment of the list of candidates.
Under German provisions, they may not designate candidates from outside companies, but may submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.
Main control findings
BRH
Number of Leads
Except in a few cases, the requirement to reach a minimum number of candidates was met.
An analysis of almost 7,000 works contracts with a value up to the national limit showed that, for restricted procedures, contracting authorities invited an average of 6.6 potential bidders and, for direct negotiated procedures, an average of 4.4 bidders.
Change of suppliers and regional restrictions
In particular, the contracting authorities did not change the range of applicants contacted in the area of building construction because they had a good experience with those with whom they had worked so far.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The contracting authorities argued that, in the event of a non-public procedure, they should guarantee to reach out to candidates whose suitability they had already ascertained beforehand.
Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the pool of non-public bidders included a larger proportion of regional bidders than it did for public procedures.
The contracting authorities explained this by the low level of the contract compared to the public tender and the high cost of travel for potential bidders.
Cross-checking principle and proposals from self-employed professionals
For the most part, contracting authorities ignored the obligation to amend the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.
In particular, they argued lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable candidate.
In many cases, the records did not show who proposed the candidate who was asked to participate in the procedure.
A check of some samples showed that the list of potential candidates was drawn up by self-employed experts and accepted by the contracting authority without changes.
As a result, contracting authorities were insufficiently protective against potential tampering.
Confidentiality of treatment of potential candidates lists
One contracting authority kept a list of candidates for the invitation to tender in a database to which all staff had access at any time.
This allowed for manipulation or unauthorised disclosure of the names of prospective or admitted bidders, who could then agree on a price.
Documentation
The dossier gave reasons for the selection of candidates in only a few cases.
OWN
Selection criteria for candidates
When the road circuit was built, the bidders were not informed of what of their qualification data would be evaluated and how.
For the event related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports in the tender notice for participation in the restricted procedure, the criteria for limiting the number of bidders were not established.
All eight tenderers met the qualifications but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority had limited participation in the procurement procedure.
The Commission then selected the candidates using a random selection method — by drawing lots, which was legal at the time.
That procedure should already have been mentioned as a criterion in the tender notice.
Summary
In view of the high risk of manipulation in selecting the winning bidder in limited procurement procedures, both countries have put in place special measures to prevent illicit restrictions on competition.
The German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by means of so-called cross-checking (the four eyes principle), by keeping the list of tenderers confidential and by prohibiting external companies from making proposals for the selection of tenderers.
The Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions to manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of bidders.
However, the inspection found that some of the said rules were not applied to a sufficient extent and that an inadmissible restriction on the pool of candidates was not prevented in some cases.
Contracting authorities are obliged to eliminate the aforementioned shortcomings completely.
Submission of tenders
The procurement stage, in which potential tenderers can prepare their bids on the basis of the tender documents they have received, begins with the publication of the tender information and/or the call for tenders.
Until the opening date of the envelopes, potential tenderers may submit their tenders to the contracting authority for the award of the contract.
The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption
EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.
The contracting authority must follow the national rules governing this stage of the procedure and prevent potential manipulation.
Those rules relate in particular to organisation and control.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The principle is that tender documents on the basis of which potential contractors prepare their tenders must always be sent by the contracting authority.
Projection offices, which are involved in management, should not fulfil this role.
The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.
In the event of confusion in the procurement documents or where further questions arise, only the contracting authority may supply the information to the tenderers.
The design offices in charge of drafting the tender dossier cannot provide any information.
Throughout this stage, any contact between the design office and the tenderers must be prevented.
They must remain anonymous throughout, as allowing them to contact them may adversely affect the competition.
Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically submitted bids must be encoded.
Different provisions
In Germany, the contracting authority may instruct insured contractors to print and distribute the documentation, and their employees must be bound to observe confidentiality.
In Germany, tenders received must be marked with the date of receipt and sent directly and immediately in their original state (sealed) to the official in charge of their safekeeping.
This staff member shall have no involvement in the procurement process.
Tenders received must be locked until the opening date of the envelopes.
In the Czech Republic, offers received are marked with a serial number.
The contracting authority shall draw up a report with the details of the competition, including the number of the tender and information on the preparation and receipt of the tender.
There are no special rules for the safekeeping of bids.
Main control findings
BRH
BRH checked the assignment of the administration building.
Submission of tender documents
The audited contracting authorities circulated the tender documents either directly or entrusted an external firm to print and distribute them.
Self-employed people did not send any documentation.
Information to be provided to candidates
For the part of the procurement documents relating to interviewing and obtaining information, the procuring entity did not follow the rule of separate planning from the procurement procedure.
Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not include in the documentation the names of his contact staff, but rather the staff of the Project Management Unit.
Some tender notices even included the names of firms or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of tender documents.
In rare cases, candidates who raised questions during the procurement process did not receive identical information.
Menu Labelling
For the contracting authorities, all tenders received were stamped and receipted.
However, in some cases in the negotiated procedure, offers were accepted by self-employed professionals, in breach of the one-building rule against corruption.
Custody of the tenders
Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.
For one contracting authority, tenders were temporarily placed in an open mailroom compartment that all employees had access to.
Another contracting authority placed a mailbox in a corridor without constant supervision, and some of the bids thrown in the mailbox stayed there overnight.
The box opening was wide and unsecured, making it accessible not only to employees.
OWN
The SAO did not find any shortcomings in this area.
Summary
Rules are laid down in both countries to prevent contacts, in particular between interested companies and design offices cooperating in the procurement process, throughout the process.
Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all candidates.
Rules to prevent manipulation and corruption are appropriate for the receipt, custody and confidentiality of offers.
In Germany the requirements are somewhat more elaborated than in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, accumulated inspection records have shown breaches of the rules in some areas.
These discrepancies can easily be corrected.
Opening envelopes
Opening envelopes
During the opening of the envelopes, tenders that have so far been closed are opened, their contents read and published.
The period for which a tenderer is bound by its tender shall begin when the closing date for the submission of envelopes expires or when they are opened and shall end on a date determined by the contracting authority.
The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption
European legislation does not contain any specific provisions dealing with the opening of envelopes.
However, national laws and regulations contain extensive requirements to protect both tenders and competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement process.
The principles of ‘more eyes’, transparency and trustworthiness in the process of opening envelopes are intended to prevent the manipulation and editing of tenders already submitted.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Opening of envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.
Conformity with the ‘more eyes’ principle is intended to prevent individuals from covertly manipulating offers.
Candidates may be present when the envelopes are opened.
At the time of opening, all envelopes must be placed before the chairman of the commission and opened one by one.
Tenders received late must be disregarded.
To ensure transparency in the opening of envelopes, this phase, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing. The record must include, but is not limited to, the names of the bidders and the prizes offered.
The entry must be read and signed by the group leader.
The minutes may also be signed by the candidates present.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, a commission is being set up to open envelopes.
The participation of independent experts is permitted.
Panel members may also be tasked with deliberating at subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. evaluating tenders.
In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of the manager and the registrar.
The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.
The head and, in the case of building, the recorder shall not be involved in the preparatory stage (drafting of the procurement documents), shall not be allowed to decide on the award of the contract and may not be a member in the subsequent processing (management) of the contract.
German regulations require that the opening minutes contain not only the offer prices, but also all information about discounts and special (unusual) symptoms, such as damaged envelopes when tenders are received or received late.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the tender prices, an indication of the language of the tender and the signature authority of the tenderer must be included in the minutes drawn up.
German regulations require all parts of opened envelopes to be marked in order to avoid subsequent changes.
Tenders, usually marked in the form of a date-stamped perforation, must be kept confidential (secret) after the envelopes have been opened and may be disclosed only to persons who further process them.
There are no similar measures in the Czech Republic.
If a single bid is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be opened and the tenderer must be notified immediately.
In Germany, they do not have this arrangement, and if a single tender is accepted, it is opened and evaluated.
Main control findings
BRH
Cross-checking principle
During the opening of the envelopes, the contracting authorities adhered to the four-eyes principle.
There was always a supervisor and a recorder present who was not assigned a different role.
However, in rare cases, for small negotiated procedures, individuals have opened tenders sent to them, without the involvement of the contracting authority.
Envelope Opening Progress
records from opening envelopes did not always document the process.
In some cases, tenders submitted late were not marked and in some cases signatures were missing.
Tagging incoming bids
The contracting authorities marked bids with a date perforation, which was in line with the requirements.
Some of them have labelled offers incorrectly in the past, but changed their practice after notifying BRH.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
OWN
Deadline for receipt of tenders
In road repairs, for one event, a bidder's bid was submitted to the contracting authority one month late, which nevertheless accepted it.
Summary
The essential parts of the opening of envelopes in the two countries are identical with regard to the principle of "more eyes" and the principle of transparency, and thus allow the risk of corruption and manipulation to be substantially reduced.
The German rules are more complex than the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure.
Marking, safe storage and respect for the confidentiality of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent amendments to tenders submitted.
In addition, the personnel responsible for opening the envelopes may not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.
The findings, despite the discovery of some irregularities, confirm that the rules on opening envelopes are largely applied.
Assessment and evaluation of bids
The awarding authority must examine and evaluate tenders received within the time limit set.
At the same time, it must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.
The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption
EU law sets out the process for assessing and evaluating offers in several steps:
The suitability of candidates is examined as a first step.
They must have a good economic and financial position and the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.
Candidates who have ever been convicted of bribery or defrauding must always be excluded from procurement procedures.
Tenders of non-eliminated tenderers must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published tender criteria.
The contracting authority must identify the most economically advantageous tender and, in particular, examine all significantly low price offers.
Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and susceptible to manipulation.
For example, tenderers may be excluded without a legitimate reason, or tenders that do not meet the requirements may be left to compete.
The result of the evaluation may be wrongly influenced by the preference given to a tenderer or its disadvantage, thereby preventing the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.
The contracting authority must therefore take special measures in selecting the persons involved in the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements of good repute and technical knowledge.
They also need to make sure that the process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Consistent with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require the examination and evaluation of tenders in successive steps.
During the evaluation, the requirements relating to the suitability of candidates, the evaluation criteria and their weightings set out in the notice or tender dossier may not be altered.
The criteria established to assess the suitability of candidates cannot be applied further.
Further evaluation may only be carried out on the basis of evaluation criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view, whether they are complete or do not include suspicious elements likely to encourage manipulation.
Where tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they must be informed immediately.
If, as a result of the evaluation of the tenders, a disproportionately low tender price is found, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment before any elimination of his tender.
The reasons for the decision must be transparently documented.
Different provisions
In Germany, bidders must observe confidentiality and only authorised persons may take part in the evaluation of bids.
The mathematical accuracy of tenders can only be reviewed by the contracting authority.
Only staff who are not integrated into the decision-making phase of the selection of the contractor or the implementation phase of the project may be entrusted with the evaluation.
There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.
If external companies are entrusted with reviewing and evaluating the bids, they must be aware that the bids are confidential and honourably respect that fact.
They may only make proposals for decisions to the contracting authority.
In the Czech Republic, tenders must be examined and evaluated by a commission, appointed by the contracting authority, which will prepare a report proposing the conclusion of a contract.
However, in both countries, the final decision depends on the contracting authority.
If, in Germany, the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently produce the required documents within six days.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If bidders fail to meet this obligation, their bids must be eliminated.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide to give the tenderer the opportunity to complete the missing documents.
If a candidate fails to substantiate them, they must be eliminated.
In Germany, not only the overall price but also the unit prices have to be reviewed.
If the price structure of the bid indicates that prices for parts of the overall project have been estimated disproportionately high or low, bidders must be asked to explain.
If they do not provide an explanation and if the contracting authority can prove that the tender contains compensatory prices, such tenders must be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from submitting price calculations on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to the different parts of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.
In the Czech Republic, the overall price of a work is evaluated and the prices of the parts are not examined in detail.
Price compensation is not a reason to exclude a bid.
In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers a disproportionately high or low price.
Where one or more tenders differ in price by 10% or more than the price estimated by the contracting authority or other tenders, tenderers must demonstrate that their tender has been credibly and convincingly aggregated.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.
In the Czech Republic, a tender may be cancelled after a price review if only tenders with unreasonably low prices have been received and the tenderers have not justified the prices.
If the price of the tender is significantly higher than the contracting authority's estimate, this is not a reason for refusing to award the contract to the tenderer concerned (unlike under German procurement law).
If there is any suspicion in Germany of conduct intended to restrict competition, the contracting authority is obliged to report this fact to the relevant superior authority without delay.
The latter must decide what action to take and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust or law enforcement authorities.
Furthermore, they must approve (e.g. when the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest bidder) whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is negotiated or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.
Czech rules do not regulate this area.
Main control findings
BRH
Suitability testing and procurement criteria
Most of the procurement procedures examined complied with the relevant requirements.
For some of the recommendations of potential contractors, made by self-employed persons, the contracting authorities themselves did not check the suitability of the tenderers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In some procurement cases, insufficient documentation was provided as to whether all published evaluation criteria were taken into account by the contracting authority in the choice, or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.
Selection of interested parties and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting authorities used the services of unauthorised persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of building authorities.
They were integrated into the planning or implementation process of the construction projects, performing functions that were to be held solely by the contracting authority.
The contracting authorities sought to substantiate this with their insufficient human resources in the sector.
In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to review offers of services by persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of offers and to carry out with due care their obligations under the contract.
As far as contracting authorities were concerned, there was generally no conclusive record of whether offers in the safe-keeping of self-employed professionals were available only to specified persons.
Menu review and mathematical review
Some contracting authorities passed open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first undertaking the prescribed examination of tenders and the mathematical examination and without documenting the results of those examinations.
In the event of any intention to manipulate, third parties may have made changes to tenders which could not be identified by the contracting authority.
Examination of the documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the offers were not adequately labelled or where data on prices and products were missing.
Performance audits
A sample check by one contracting authority revealed that in 75% of procurement cases, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10% from the pre-estimated costs.
One out of 20 tenders was cancelled due to inadequate tender prices.
In many cases, there was no record or sufficient documentation of the examination of tenders or of negotiations with tenderers for further clarification.
In many cases, detailed information such as unit prices of the most important invoiced items was also missing.
Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often cited as the reason for deviations.
The contracting authorities argued that it was difficult to identify and prove balancing prices.
In the case of one call for tenders, made by an entity outside the range of ordinary contracting entities, a 66% lower price was offered compared to the initial cost estimate.
No data were recorded on closer examination of cost or on the reasons for deviations.
In clarifying this question, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping on the tenderer to which the contract would eventually be awarded.
It was therefore not made clear whether the initial cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.
Later, the contracting authority rated that tenderer as a "low-cost company" that was unable to meet either quality requirements or deadlines.
In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35% higher than the initial cost estimate.
The contracting authority did not annul the procurement procedure and put forward an unfounded argument that the said tenderer could be presumed not to have based its pricing on unreasonably high costs.
Suspected irregularities
Two cases of irregularities were found in one contracting authority, and these were reported to the firm responsible for technical supervision.
In one procurement, two bidders submitted bids containing identical price calculations, prompting the contracting authority to exclude both bids.
The inspections did not reveal any significant shortcomings in the application of the other provisions.
OWN
Suitability test
For many building events, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from participating in a procurement procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements of the contracting authority as set out in the tender specifications, or did not provide evidence of qualification to the extent required, or, conversely, one contracting authority could not substantiate or explain the reason for the exclusion of a candidate who met the requirements.
Rating
In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, although the various evaluation criteria of the contract award procedure for the contractor were established, they were not respected by the contracting authority during the procedure.
For the railway infrastructure development action, the weightings of the award evaluation criteria were not set at the start of the evaluation process, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.
For the road repair project, the assessment of the criterion of ‘shortening the construction period’ was not carried out correctly.
For second- and third-place bidders, the evaluation incorrectly indicated a greater reduction in construction time than indicated in their bids.
Documentation of candidate selection reasons
For the three housing promotion actions, the contracting authority did not substantiate on what criteria it assessed the bids received and how it selected the most appropriate of them.
The accuracy of the selection of small-scale contractors associated with the construction of a road circuit with an estimated price of up to 500K.
The CZK could not be verified, as suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on price and delivery date, but no proof of these negotiations was produced.
Summary
In both countries, the rules for the verification and evaluation of tenders comply with EU requirements.
They differ, however, with regard to the specific steps of the procedure and the choice of the individuals involved in the procedure.
Unlike the Czech Republic, in Germany these steps of the procurement process are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially as regards the application of the cross-principle and the protection of tenders.
The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.
In both countries, it was found in some cases of checks that substantial steps in the process of verifying and evaluating tenders had not been documented at all and, if so, only partially.
The lack of control tools and transparency in decision-making during the review and evaluation of tenders allows for manipulation.
The inspections showed serious deficiencies, such as the transmission of tenders to third parties without prior proper examination and documentation of tenders by the contracting authority.
Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of the functions related to the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased scrutiny of measures against increased possibility of manipulation are necessary.
In checking the legitimacy of the prices, the audited German contracting authorities did not in all cases make use of the complete set of tools available and did not address their own pricing structure.
In the Czech Republic, weaknesses were found in the evaluation of the suitability of offers and the use of evaluation criteria.
Completion of tender
After the tenders have been examined and evaluated, the procurement process is concluded with the award of the contract or the cancellation of the procedure.
The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption
In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the decision to award the contract.
Suppliers shall have an opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request a review if appropriate.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The 10-day time limit applies to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.
The contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this period or before the review procedure has been decided.
If the review body rejects the complaint and upholds the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the application of the procurement law reviewed by an independent court.
This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of contractors by swiftly implementing the award decision.
The contracting authority must document the progress of the procedure appropriately.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have implemented management information obligations.
In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.
However, it cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly conducted screening and evaluation.
The contracting authority is to conclude the contract at the specified time.
This is because after this deadline the bidder is not bound by its bid.
The contract content must not deviate from the winning bid.
Unsuccessful tenderers are to be informed of the result in good time, stating the reason why their tender has not been accepted.
Cancellation of the procurement procedure is permissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in the tenders do not comply with the specifications.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting time before the conclusion of a contract of 10 or 15 days applies to both European and national procedures.
In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European proceedings.
In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of the contract before a decision is taken on its EU provisions and review award.
In the Czech Republic, the tender procedure must be cancelled if a single tender was received or only one tender met the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.
In Germany, a contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender meets the conditions set out in the tender specifications and is cost-effective.
Main control findings
BRH
The inspections found few inconsistencies in the completion of the audited procurement processes.
In some instances of European proceedings, the enabling companies received letters before the reporting deadline, which may invalidate the contract.
Also, in several cases of open procedures, letters of authorisation contained modifications incompatible with the tender content, e.g. new deadlines.
In some cases, contracting authorities did not meet the award deadlines.
In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because a tenderer offering a price more than 50% lower no longer wished to perform the contract at the price originally offered.
OWN
In the refurbishment and construction of the college, in one case the contracting authority did not conclude a works contract with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the tender of the successful tenderer.
For some road repair and maintenance operations, the construction of the motorway and the ring road, contracts were concluded later than the statute.
For construction works in former military tours, the contracting authority sent a notice of selection of the most suitable tender to all tenderers after the statutory deadline.
Summary
Both countries have implemented EU rules on the termination of procurement procedures.
Legal protection for failed candidates contributes to curbing corruption.
The Czech Public Procurement Law includes the Institute of Legal Protection even in cases of contracts below EU limits.
In both countries, it was found that the limited time limit for concluding a contract was exceeded.
This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, contracting authorities should eliminate such shortcomings when concluding procurement procedures.
Documentation, notifications, information obligations
The procurement process, with all its stages, relevant findings and decisions, including relevant justifications, shall be documented in a transparent manner.
The completion of the procurement process at European level must be published.
The data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.
The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption
The obligation to document procurement procedures is in line with the fundamental requirement of the EU-wide principle of transparency.
Only proper and time-relevant documentation on decision-making and justification gives a guarantee of transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds the European limits.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to provide detailed justification for individual decisions and their justification significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
In cases of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify the completion of these procedures to the EU's Office of Official Publications within 48 days of the date of award of the contract.
The Office publishes the notice in the Official Journal of the EU and this also fulfils the transparency requirement.
The contracting authority must summarise the essential details of its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission produces annual statistics to provide an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries fully transposed into their national legislation the provisions of the European law on documentation and notification obligations.
The provisions on documentation and notification for European statistics purposes are almost identical in both countries.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the award of a contract applies not only to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.
The notice period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.
In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those which are mandatory under European law, applies only to restricted procedures exceeding the limit of €25K (£625K) and direct procedures exceeding the limit of €15K (£375K) including VAT.
Only interested parties are informed below this limit.
Main control findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the terms of reference were not fully documented.
The notification did not contain all the necessary information, e.g. reasons for the supply specifications and national rules.
In one case, the contracting authority did not explain why it had contracted a tenderer whose tender did not include mandatory particulars.
In several cases, some required records were also missing.
Award Publication
In the case of some European procedures, the contracting authority erred in the publication of the notice.
In several of the terms of reference, there was no evidence of publication of the notice.
Notification obligation
The statistically cleared files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent on time.
Preliminary transparency
In most cases, the procuring entity disclosed the contract result.
In the case of one sponsor, contract information was not disclosed due to a communication error.
It took the contracting authority six months to notice the error.
Consequently, the outcome of the proceedings was not disclosed during that period.
OWN
Documentation
For events related to the organisation of a major sporting event, significant shortcomings in the documentation of the tender process were identified, such as incorrect bidding price data in the evaluation committee's meeting protocols.
In addition, some of the documents opening the envelopes were not signed.
Award Publication
In preparation for the repair and maintenance of the roads, the construction of the motorway and the road circuit, the contract award notices were sent after the deadline or were not published.
Summary
Provisions on documentation and notification and notification obligations include European requirements and are almost identical in both countries.
This generally ensures the transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.
The Czech reporting obligations are somewhat stricter compared to the German ones.
The checks revealed shortcomings substantially reducing the value of the dossier as a means of preventing corruption.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Contracting entities should continue to enhance the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with reporting and notification requirements.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
Parallel audits of the SAO and BRH focused on two areas that are essential for the public procurement process in both the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.
EU legislation provides an opportunity for international competition within the EU to create a single European market.
Measures to prevent corruption are not only intended to avoid it or at least to reduce it, but also to prevent financial damage and possible loss of confidence in the integrity of government.
The audit findings of the two audit institutions - the SAO and BRH - with regard to the application of the two countries' procurement law and the comparison of its respective provisions give an inside view of the common and different elements that may assist the two countries in the further development and application of this law.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries transposed EU procurement law into their national legislation.
There is thus an important common base in both countries for public procurement and the fulfilment of basic requirements in the area of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.
Contracting authorities reinforce these requirements in part with very extensive measures.
The Czech Republic has extended public procurement provisions requiring a European procedure to procedures that are below EU limits and are therefore governed by national legislation.
Nevertheless, checks have shown that contracting authorities are not always fully compliant with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.
German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate the irregularities mentioned, taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the controls identified risks affecting economy and achieving value for money.
These include, in particular, an incomplete definition of the subject-matter of the contract, which resulted in additional works often awarded in breach of the law, a lack of definition of the price envisaged, and the requisite qualifications, which narrowed down the potential pool of tenderers and thus reduced competition, particularly in the field of transport works.
Preventing corruption
The joint inspections were not aimed at detecting cases of corruption.
The reason was that both BRH and the SAO did not have sufficient tools to do so.
They can nevertheless examine whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to curb corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are applied.
In terms of preventing corruption, the two countries have focused on different aspects.
Above all, German provisions give room for broad and unrestricted competition, transparency, and controls as a central element in preventing corruption.
The Czech regulations are mainly aimed at enhancing the transparency of procurement procedures.
BRH
In Germany, there are general principles for preventing corruption that apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles have also been incorporated into the requirements of public procurement and have been adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.
The relevant provisions specify, at times with great precision, the ways of complying with the requirements to prevent corruption during the procurement process and the choice of the people included therein.
In the BRH's view, the principle of preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate tool to substantially reduce the risk of corruption in public procurement, while limiting competition increases the risk of manipulation.
Risk analysis and adequate controls (in particular the principle of cross-checking), transparency requirements, procurement documents and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms for preventing corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions must comply with when awarding public contracts.
Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.
Irregularities found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in compliance with some requirements.
Therefore, contracting authorities should provide further training to their staff, familiarising them with anti-corruption requirements and further raising their awareness in this area.
A significant proportion of the weaknesses identified relate to activities delegated by the construction administration to private entrepreneurs.
However, the absence of adequate controls in the delegation of powers increases the risk of abuse.
Activities susceptible to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorised interference.
OWN
In the Czech Republic, anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at government level, affecting the area of public procurement in a significant way.
The audit actions of the SAO took place during the period of implementation of one of the most important parts of this strategy, namely a significant amendment of the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of the subsequent implementing regulations.
The strategy adopted and the new statutory provisions can be effective steps to improve the situation.
Under the new rules, the contracting authority must, for example, justify the effectiveness of the contract, establish the anticipated value of the contract, the adequacy of the requirements for qualifications, establish the basic evaluation criteria and the way tenders are evaluated, and properly document and publish everything.
Recommendations
Overall, both the SAO and BRH have a favourable opinion of the ways in which EU requirements are implemented.
Their broad application in practice has confirmed that EU requirements for competition, equal treatment and transparency form an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.
The supranational model, established in the EU, can also serve as a base for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.
Taking into account the great potential for material and non-material damage resulting from manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, both BRH and the SAO insist that it is the responsibility of the contracting authorities to continue and improve measures against corruption and manipulation where possible.
In particular, organisational structures and procurement processes should be continuously monitored for weaknesses and risks to identify and respond appropriately to the need for remedial action.
Compared to the practice in Germany, it has emerged that the share of open procurement procedures should be increased in the Czech Republic, giving room for competition and substantially reducing the possibility of corrupt behaviour.
Parcel procurement may also have a positive impact on the price achieved in cases where this is permissible and appropriate for the contracting authority. The higher number of bidders puts pressure on the price achieved.
Ensuring its organisation also has an influence on the conduct of the procurement process.
In Germany, it is provided by special state organisations, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport structures, it is organised by the central authorities themselves or through contracting organisations.
Both the SAO and BRH wish to further develop the knowledge in their work where appropriate and to address it with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.
Moreover, they believe that the principles of procurement law and its implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as these principles and findings are of general importance to effectively tackle corruption and to ensure that public contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that value for money is achieved.

JOINT FINAL REPORT on the Results of Parallel Controls on the Administration of Excise Duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic
Joint final report
May 2017
Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic
Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic
Introduction Word
The submitted joint report reports on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel controls carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on excise management in 2012-2015.
The cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the two countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic in the execution of parallel controls aimed at the management of excise duties, which was concluded in August 2015.
The topic of parallel controls was chosen based on the fact that the two EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to see how it is applied at national level, how the system of excise management is set up and how the systems in the SR and the CR differ.
The greatest benefits of the control actions carried out were in exchanging experience, identifying differences and identifying good practice.
Last but not least, the benefit of finding that international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise administration is very limited without parallel controls.

about the results of parallel controls of the SPD administration in SR and CR
Summary and evaluation
The legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and their administration is in line with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.
Differences have been identified between the adjustment of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic; in the Czech Republic, the verification of the economic stability of applicants for the issuance of permits and the mandatory marking and colouring of selected mineral oils and certain other oils contribute to the efficient administration of excise duties; In SR, the distribution of control stamps is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less burdensome for tax authorities.
In the fight against evasion of excise duties, supervision of the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw material, the implementation of the fuel distributor institute and the registration of sellers of consumer alcohol packaging have proved good practice in both countries.
Revenue from excise duties in the SR and the Czech Republic is growing more slowly than other tax revenues.
The EU's objectives of reducing labour taxation, introducing eco-saving measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, inter alia because there is no indexation of excise rates in both countries.
This has the effect of reducing the materiality of excise duties in total tax revenues and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, a real reduction in the tax burden of excise duties.
The introduction of environmental measures has long been financially supported by the state, but the measures have a negative impact on excise revenue, which will thus need to be replaced in the future by other revenues or by a reduction in the state's spending.
Administrative expenditure incurred to manage excise duties in both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic has been growing over the long term, mainly due to wage increases, and their efficiency has been declining.
In the SR, this efficiency is also negatively affected by expenditure on the computerisation of excise administration (IT expenditure) and expenditure incurred on wages of employees performing permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.
The electronisation of excise administration in SR has not had a significant effect on the reduction in the number of tax administrations.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend that the FŘ SR reconsider the merits of the exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on ethyl alcohol.
In the Czech Republic, the efficiency of administrative expenditure was affected by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the audited period which would have led to a reduction in the personnel intensity of excise administration.
The number of comparable administrative actions of tax administrations was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the different years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax entities in the Slovak Republic is about a third lower than in the Czech Republic.
Tax administrators in the Slovak Republic perform administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical exercise of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis.
The management of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is more administratively demanding than in the Czech Republic and, given the ratio of the number of tax operations to the number of entities, more costly.
The electronisation of excise administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.
In the Slovak Republic, the administration of excise tax returns is fully electronised; in the Czech Republic, documents proving the taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are transmitted electronically.
Both methods of electronisation promote the efficient management of excise duties and therefore the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend applying them not only in both countries.
The total expenditure for the introduction of the EMCS could not be compared as the PSR only provided expenditure data for the upgrade of the system in the period 2011-2015, but the expenditure was also made before this period.
The expenses incurred in that period only for the upgrade of EMCS were about 20% higher in SR than those incurred in the Czech Republic both for the introduction of EMCS and for the upgrade of this system over more than a decade.
Excise tax managers in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic did not achieve comparable values of quality indicators when spending comparably.
The level of surveillance is comparable in both countries, but in the SR, the management of excise duties is significantly more resource-intensive.
The introduction of the Electronic System for Monitoring the Movement of Excise Products (EMCS) has made excise tax administration more efficient, but lower in the SR as significantly higher expenditure was spent on the introduction of the system and its modernisation than in the Czech Republic.
Basic information
The cooperation of the two audit institutions was carried out under the Cooperation Treaty in carrying out parallel controls on the management of excise duties on 18.8.2015.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic agreed to carry out parallel checks, primarily focused on issues of excise administration, the results of which will allow analysis, mutual comparison and evaluation of the findings.
Joint audit questions were agreed on which the parallel controls were based.
Subject characteristics and objectives of parallel control:
The aim of the parallel controls was to compare the performance of excise managers, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify weaknesses in the excise management process.
In particular, the following main audit questions were to be answered:
Did excise tax managers in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic achieve comparable values of quality indicators when spending comparably?
Has the introduction of the Electronic Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) made excise administration more efficient and has the expenditure to introduce it been expedient?
Parallel checks should have identified the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, especially in the regulatory and organisational structure setting.

Legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
The excise administration legislation is divided into the EU regulatory level (see Annex 1) and the national regulatory level (see Annex 2).
Council Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC defines excise duty and lays down the basic rules for the management of taxes and the treatment of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
This directive allows taxes on consumption to be imposed on other products.
In particular, EU legislation lays down minimum conditions for: the level of tax rates for each type of product selected, the production, storage, processing and holding of products subject to tax, chargeability, exemption and refund, supervision of the transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and the keeping of registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.
EU legislation makes it possible to introduce control procedures and institutes at national level, provided they do not distort competition.
Excise Tax Legislation in the Czech Republic
Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the legislation on excise duties is concentrated in the Law on excise duties (Law 353/2003 Coll.), which governs the administration of the mineral oil tax, the alcohol tax, the tobacco product tax, the beer tax, the wine and intermediate tax and the raw tobacco tax.
This law defines the forms of treatment of products subject to excise duties, the taxpayer, the authorisation procedure, the conditions for the transport of products, the declaration of the tax and the penalties for infringements.
In addition, the law and subsequent decrees regulate certain other conditions for the handling of mineral oils (mineral oil labelling), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, the monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and the storage of raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products.
Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in Parts 45 to 47 of Act 261/2007 Coll., on the Stabilisation of Public Budgets.
In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the management of excise duties are contained in special legislation. The Fuel Act No 311/2006 Coll. and the Implementing Regulation govern the conditions for the sale, supply, distribution of fuel and the keeping of a register of fuel entered into free circulation.
Act No 61/1997 Coll., on ethyl alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for the production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of ethyl alcohol.
Act No 307/2013 Coll., on the compulsory marking of ethyl alcohol, and the relevant implementing provisions lay down the compulsory marking of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging, the conditions for handling surveillance tapes and the conditions for handling ethyl alcohol (i.e. for the production, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, storage, taking over, use, possession, import or export of ethyl alcohol).
Tax procedure procedures not provided for in the special rules are governed by Act No 280/2009 Coll., the Tax Code.
The penalties are imposed in accordance with the procedures laid down in Act No 500/2004 Coll., the Code of Administrative Procedure.
The conditions for issuing a trade licence (concession) to operate a business ‘production and processing of fuels and lubricants and distribution of fuel’ and ‘production, treatment and sale of fermentation spirit, drinking spirit and spirits’ are governed by Act No 455/1991 Coll., on the Trade Licensing Business (the Trade Licensing Act).
The Czech Republic has used the authorisation to establish control procedures and institutes to control the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and to monitor compliance with the legislation when handling selected products for which excise duty has not been paid as well as when handling selected products for which duty has already been paid.
These are the monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and raw tobacco, the labelling of certain other mineral oils, the labelling of tobacco products and ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging.
The Czech Republic made use of the authorisation to apply excise duty to other products and introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.
Structure of amendments to legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to subject of control in the Czech Republic
Following the resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic of 3 October 2012 No 735, to implement the "Zero Tolerance Plan for the Black Market in Spirits," major legislative adjustments took place in the Czech Republic in 2012-2015, introducing a number of measures against tax fraud on excise duty on spirit.
During the same period, there were also major changes in the legislation for the mineral oil tax, the tobacco products tax and the criminality of preparing tax cuts.
Criminal law protection of tax revenue
With effect from 1 July 2016, the criminality of preparing the offence of "reduction of tax, fee and similar compulsory payment" is introduced. The arrangements made should allow police authorities to take more effective and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, e.g. by deploying operational search resources.
General provisions for excise management
The issue of a licence to dispose of excisable products under the Excise Duties Act, with effect from 1.01.2015, is subject to: reliability; debt-free; economic stability; the right to operate a business enabling the exercise of an authorisation-related activity; a situation in which the claimant is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.
In particular, the aim of the legislation was to address the issue of the build-up of tax arrears by reducing the entities authorised to deal with products subject to excise duty.
The condition of economic stability newly allows the tax administration to take into account the financial situation of tax subjects both in the context of the authorisation procedure and after the authorisation has been granted.
The purpose of this measure is to prevent entities that do not have sufficient financial revenue to comply properly with tax obligations from handling the selected products.
To assess the economic stability of the proposer, indicators (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity) have been established on the basis of which the financial analysis is carried out.
In addition to these indicators, the administrative discretion of the tax authorities depends on the individual circumstances of the procedure.
The law provides for a periodicity of verification of compliance with the economic stability condition due to the timeliness of the data — the verification is carried out once a year following the deadline for filing income tax returns.
The tax authorities have the option to lay down other conditions necessary for the administration of the tax.
If the permit holder does not comply with the conditions, the tax administration is entitled to revoke the permit, or to revoke it deferred if necessary.
Of the 2,609 entities for which the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of arrears if the tax liability exceeded the amount of collateral tax (e.g. recurring beneficiary).
Permits were revoked for 10 entities, other applicants increased the security of the tax, capitalised their contribution to the company or substantiated up-to-date accounting data showing that they already met all the conditions for issuing a permit.
In addition to the claimant, the conditions of reliability and indebtedness must be met by a natural person who is or is a member of the statutory body or by a natural person who, although not a member of the claimant's statutory body, carries out that activity (a chain of legal persons in the capacity of the statutory body or its member, so-called tied entities).
By the end of 2016, more than 30,000 linked subjects had been screened.
The registers kept under the Excise Duties Act (Sections 37 to 40 and Section 60 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.) contain data on:
the type, name, code and quantity of goods produced, received, delivered or dispatched, broken down by type of tax treatment arrangement (conditional exemption arrangement, importation, re-introduction to a conditional exemption arrangement, exportation, free circulation, captive consumption, loss);
the identifier (SEED ID) of the recipient or supplier of the selected products, the declarant, the date of the event and the record entry;
transport of selected products (e.g. means of transport, carriers, transport numbers);
the registration numbers of the related documents;
notification of the release for free tax circulation of the spirit in a consumer pack marked with a surveillance tape and details of its distribution.
A record of the take-over after transport shall be made as soon as it is completed.
In the case of an electronically maintained register, the register must be kept or allow output in the format xls, xlsx, ods.
Alcohol
After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures designed to provide a detailed overview of the activities of the entities (see Annex 3, Schedule A) from the production of raw alcohol to the marking with surveillance tape to its distribution to the final seller or to the entitled user of the exempt alcohol.
In the Czech Republic, the production facility for the production of ethyl alcohol, which is not in operation, is subject to supervision by customs authorities.
The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview over the processing of spirit drinks and the production of spirit drinks and to identify those handling spirit in consumer packaging, to reduce the disposal of spirit to financially stable and reliable persons and to ensure constant supervision of the production and marking of spirit drinks.
The most significant measures are: the production, intake, stock records and the release of ethyl alcohol contain information on the quantity of ethyl alcohol by stages of production and processing of ethyl alcohol, indicating the numbers of the documents.
Limitation of the volume of the consumer packaging, the material of the packaging and limitation of the number of packages with broken surveillance tape at the point of final sale or issue to the consumer.
Consumer packaging means a container or other packaging with a capacity of not more than one litre or three litres if it is a container made of glass.
Spirits in larger packs are regarded as non-branded and prohibited from being handled.
At the point of final sale to a natural person for his or her personal consumption, a maximum of one consumer pack with a broken surveillance tape, or three if fitted with a one-way valve, can be found.
Compulsory registration of a person who places ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging products having at least 15% alcohol by volume into free tax circulation and is: an importer of ethyl alcohol, a producer of ethyl alcohol in the Czech Republic or a tax warehouse operator under a conditional exemption regime, provided that personal and technical conditions are met.
The personal conditions — reliability, integrity and non-disclosure of the disqualification — must be met by the applicant and a person in a position of authority or responsible representative.
The applicant must provide a bail of between CZK 100,000 and CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. about €3,700 and €185,000), depending on the estimated amount of control tapes collected.
The technical conditions for registration are a suitable place to mark ethyl alcohol and to equip the place of marking or tax warehouse with a continuous-traffic camera tracking device and remote access by the tax authorities.
Registration markings of the surveillance tape are in place for the marking of spirit drinks of more than 0,06 litre.
When the control tapes are transported, the registration mark of the control tapes must appear on the transport documents or customs declaration at export.
The check tape until 30.11.2013 contained a 10-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration sampling number, an application code for the allocation of check tapes and a classification code according to the ethanol concentration level by volume.
The surveillance tape from 1.12.2013 newly contains two types of identifiers and the amount of ethyl alcohol in the consumer package expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20 °C, rounded down to the whole millilitres.
The register of surveillance tapes for the marking of spirit drinks contains daily records of each method of handling the surveillance tapes according to the registration codes, as well as the documents on the basis of which the registration took place.
When specific surveillance tapes are destroyed, lost or stolen, the holder shall, on the following working day following the operative event, electronically notify the tax authorities of the registration code of the control tapes concerned and their number.
Introducing new offences and adjusting the level of penalties imposed for infringements in the handling of surveillance tapes.
Penalties may be imposed up to the level of excise duty or up to ten times that amount (e.g. in case of destruction or loss of control tapes in excess of 0.1% of the total quantity of individual control tape orders placed, in case of failure to return the control tape within the statutory time limit).
Restrictions on the treatment of surveillance tapes only to registered keepers who are not allowed to pass them on to another person, with the exception of their provision to a foreign supplier for the purpose of marking consumer-packaged spirits produced outside the Czech Republic.
Exported surveillance tapes must be placed on the consumer packaging and imported back no later than nine months after receipt from the tax authorities.
Compulsory registration of a distributor of ethyl alcohol in a consumer pack, provided that similar personal conditions are fulfilled as for the person required to mark ethyl alcohol and with an obligation to post bail of up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approx. €185,000).
Definition of persons for the sale or purchase of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging.
Beneficiaries are obliged to sell their consumer-packaged ethyl alcohol to other registered persons or to final sellers, or they can sell it as a final seller.
They may acquire ethyl alcohol from other registered persons, an insolvency practitioner, an administrative body, organisational units of the State or non-registered persons in the execution of a tax execution.
Notices of the placing of ethyl alcohol or sales in consumer packing for free tax circulation are required to be sent by the holders and distributors of ethyl alcohol immediately following the operative event to the tax authorities by means of an information system maintained by the tax administration (ORO web client) or in accordance with content in xml format.
The notification shall include the number of control tapes used, the volume and type of consumer packaging, the percentage by volume of ethyl alcohol, the European Commodity Code (EAN), the identification of the distributor or final seller, as well as the name of the product and the batch of production.
Tax entities sent around 10.5 million notifications in 2014 and 2015.
Compulsory concession (a specific form of business licence) not only for the production and conditioning of ethyl alcohol, but also for the sale of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging by an entrepreneur to a natural person for his personal use or to another legal or business-like natural person for his own internal use.
Licensed trades can only be carried out after a decision has been taken by the Trade Licensing Office upon the fulfilment of professional competence and other conditions.
No prescribed professional competence is required for the sale of ethyl alcohol.
Benefits for tax administrations include a review of sellers and their establishments and restrictions
trading on reliable entities.
In the Czech Republic, around 94,000 concessions were registered in 2014 and in 2015 around 104,000 concessions for a field including production, preparation of fermentation spirit, drinking spirit, spirits and other alcoholic beverages, and sales.
Checks on compliance with the legislation on the treatment of products subject to excise duties in the Czech Republic are also ensured in their activities outside the tax administration: trade offices, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection Authority, the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic, the Czech Trade Inspection Authority.
If it finds that there has been a breach of duty or prohibition, it shall immediately inform the excise duty officer.
Mineral oils
The Czech Republic has put in place a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex 3, Schedule B) to which mineral oils subject to excise duty but also selected mineral oils subject to excise duty unencumbered which have been abused for tax evasion.
The system includes supervision from the production of mineral oil through the storage, transport, marking and colouring of selected mineral oils, the marking of certain other mineral oils to delivery to the final consumer or user and, in some cases, the consumption of mineral oils.
Customs supervision includes the production of markings for the marking and handling of mineral oils.
Mineral oils listed under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (kerosene others), 2710 19 29 (other medium oils not elsewhere specified) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49 are subject to the marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils unless their marking is prohibited.
For example, benzole, toluene, xylol and lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion are subject to the labelling of certain other mineral oils.
Selected mineral oils and certain other mineral oils can only be branded and coloured with a tracer if authorised by the tax authorities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The most significant new measures since 2012:
Monitoring the handling of special mineral oils, which are a group of mineral oils under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion), whose kinematic viscosity at 40 °C is less than 12 mm2 s-1 inclusive and have at least one of the following characteristics: a flash point lower than 150 °C, at least 20 % by volume including losses up to 350 °C shall be distilled during the distillation test.
These mineral oils were misused as an additive in the finished fuel, in particular diesel fuel, or were directly used or sold for motor propulsion because the physical characteristics are very similar.
Entities handling monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packages exceeding 220 litres must register with the tax authorities.
For the issuing of the registration, the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative must be fulfilled, which shall apply throughout 2 Except for beer, fruit wines, other wines and meads and fruit spirits obtained by firing.
No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.
4 For example, when using mineral oil as propellant (excluding navigation on waters other than private pleasure craft) or as a fuel ingredient, when the markings are at fault for their use.
registration.
As of 30.11.2016, the Register of Persons Handling Specific Mineral Oils contained 54 valid marketing authorisations, four marketing authorisations were revoked on the proposal of the marketing authorisation holder.
The electronic register shall contain detailed information on receipt, own consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil, including document numbers, notification numbers of acquisitions by the tax authorities, places of storage and consumption, purpose of consumption, place of storage and consumption or, at the time of sale, place of delivery and customer registration number.
Notification of any acquisition of the special mineral oil must be given to the tax authority between 24 and 72 hours before acceptance.
The identification of the commercial partners, the name and nomenclature of the particular mineral oil, the quantity, the purpose of the consumption or information on the sale or transfer shall be notified.
The notification of the estimated quantity in the relevant year of mineral oil acquired, sold or consumed shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
Notices of the purpose of use and labelling, the place of storage or consumption, the identification details of the person to whom the special mineral oil is resold or transferred, shall be provided before any change.
Notifications shall be made electronically using smart forms or a PDFa data container.
In 2015, persons handling special mineral oils filed 630 notifications.
The provision and forfeiture of special mineral oils and, where appropriate, means of transport must be pronounced by the tax authorities in cases where they find the disposal of special mineral oils without registration or where the registered person fails to fulfil his obligation to notify.
As in the case of non-compliance in the transport of products subject to excise duties, these deficiencies cannot be remedied retrospectively.
Registration of a fuel distributor is mandatory for persons who sell or are authorised to sell fuel.
Registered fuel distributors may only be persons meeting the following criteria:
Compulsory trade authority concession (a specific form of business licence).
The customs office shall give an opinion on the application for the concession, or on the appointment of the responsible representative, as appropriate, examining whether the applicant for the concession, the statutory body or the members of the applicant's statutory body, the legal person and the appointed responsible representative meet the condition of reliability.
Where such persons meet the reliability condition, the customs office shall issue a favourable opinion.
A reliable person is a person of impeccable character, from the point of view of criminal assets, customs and tax law.
Expertise is a condition of the concession.
The indebtedness of the same circle of people as in the case of reliability.
The debtor is the person who provides sufficient guarantees that he or she will duly and timely discharge his or her payment obligations to the State, i.e. he or she does not have arrears on the State budget and on universal health insurance.
A fuel distributor shall not be prohibited by a court or administrative authority from carrying out an activity which makes it impossible to carry out his activity.
The fuel distributor must not be wound up or bankrupt.
The deposit of a security (or bank guarantee) of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e. around €740,000), which can be reduced to CZK 10,000 (i.e. around €370,000) after three years of registration as a fuel distributor and the fulfilment of other conditions.
Notice of fuel distribution shall be given by the distributor to the customs office within 20 days of the end of the calendar month.
The electronic notification shall include details of the individual purchase and sale of fuel.
The data reported are data on trading partners, document numbers, product selected, quantity, price, carrier and transport, place of loading and unloading.
Entitlement to repayment of the tax on mineral oils consumed in primary agricultural production was reintroduced in late 2014.
Only an activity which is clearly related to an activity carried out on land can be claimed for reimbursement of excise duty on mineral oils.
In 2015, there were about 64,000 claims for tax refunds, totalling CZK 1,172,844,680 (or €43,401,720).
As of 2017, the government of the Czech Republic has also introduced a refund of fuel excise duty to livestock farmers.
Farmers or breeders who, for example, are involved in cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats will be able to make this claim.
Tobacco products
Restrictions on sales of old-rate tobacco products
In response to the long-term failure to achieve budgeted revenue from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced with effect from 1.12.2014 restrictions on the sale of old-rate tobacco products in the event of a change in the tax rate.
Excise duty on tobacco products is paid by the use of tobacco stickers.
The use of a tobacco label is understood as placing it on a unit packet (Section 116 of the Excise Duties Act).
For the application of the rate of excise duty, the production of the tobacco product in the condition intended for the final consumer is decisive, without the need for it to be removed, delivered, dispatched or sold, or sold to the final consumer.
The letter of the alphabet characterising the excise duty rate appears on the tobacco sticker along with the price to the final consumer of cigarettes, and the sticker indicates the number of items in the pack or the quantity of tobacco to be smoked in kilograms.
The tobacco sticker has no identifier.
The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packets of ready-to-eat cigarettes bearing a tobacco sticker with the previous (old) rate of duty has been fixed until the end of the last day of the second calendar month after the new rate of excise duty takes effect.
Developments in the removal of tobacco labels in 2014 and comparisons with those in previous years show that tobacco manufacturers have significantly pre-loaded tobacco products with the "old" tax rate each year, effectively shifting the effectiveness of the "new" tax rate by about one year.
Raw tobacco tax
Because of the misuse of raw tobacco to produce tobacco products without the permission of the tax authorities and the non-payment of excise duty, a tax on raw tobacco and the monitoring of the handling of raw tobacco were introduced as measures against tax fraud.
With effect from 1 July 2015, raw tobacco which has not been used or supplied for the manufacture of tobacco products shall be subject to excise duty on delivery to another Member State or a third country or for which the origin, the purpose of use or the person to whom the raw tobacco has been or is to be supplied has not been proved.
Restrictions on handling raw tobacco
Measures such as the supervision of the transport and manufacture of tobacco products, the marking of unit packets with surveillance tape and restrictions on sales at designated points have been added to the restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.
Manufacturing equipment for the processing of tobacco raw material and the manufacture of tobacco products shall not be subject to customs supervision.
Only a registered person may store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, but such tobacco may not be further processed or modified.
Only a person meeting the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative may be a registered person, which is valid throughout the registration period.
The conditions of registration are: (a) authorisation to operate a business enabling the activity of a person storing raw tobacco, (b) reliability, (c) debt-free, (d) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco has not been declared prohibited from carrying out his activity, (e) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, (f) the granting of a bond of CZK 20,000 (i.e. around €740,000).
The electronic register must include the date of receipt or delivery of the raw tobacco, the document number, the identification of the commercial partner, an indication of the quantity and type of raw tobacco.
Notification of any acquisition of raw tobacco by a registered person storing raw tobacco must be made to the tax authorities between 24 and 72 hours prior to receipt or dispatch.
Information on the commercial partner, quantity of raw tobacco, storage address, purpose of use and carrier details shall be reported.
The notification of the estimated quantity in the relevant year of raw tobacco received or shipped shall be submitted by the body together with the registration application or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
Notifications shall be submitted electronically through a data container in PDFa format.
The transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document containing the prescribed particulars.
Excise Tax Legislation in SR
The legal framework regulating the area of excise duties in the SR is based on EU legislation and thus co-creates its single tax system.
The various types of excise taxes are exhaustively determined by the SR legislation, which is similar to that of surrounding countries.
Definition of legislation in SR
Legislative arrangements for excise duties are secured by four laws on a subject-by-subject basis.
The harmonisation was achieved by the adoption of the following excise laws: Act No 98/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on mineral oils, Act No 106/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on tobacco products, Act No 530/2011 Z. z., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No 609/2007 Z. z., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
All excise laws are substantive laws and deal with the taxation of the object of excise duties in the tax territory.
Act No 563/2009 of the Z. z., on the Administration of Taxes (Tax Code), is a regulation of procedural law, regulating the administration of taxes, the rights and obligations of tax subjects and other persons.
This legal framework has transposed individual provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, and has also transposed provisions of other directives and European Community legislation.
Structure of legislative changes for different types of excise duties in relation to the subject matter of the SR inspection
Since 2011, the excise administration legislation has undergone several major changes to the structure of individual excise duties.
In EMCS, the monitoring of the transport of selected products subject to excise duty under the conditional exemption regime has been changed from a paper accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system where such traffic is monitored in real time.
Under the EMCS electronic system, the suspension of access to the EMCS by tax entities was introduced in 2015.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The customs office has the option to suspend access precisely when there is a justified concern about a tax that has not been paid or determined in previous tax years and is not recoverable.
This concerns the payment of the tax, as the composition of the security is required for the transport of excise goods, but it is released by the end of the transport.
Excise duty on mineral oils
A major change in the administration of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011 when the option to use so-called red diesel was removed.
Labelled gas oil, commonly also called red diesel, was one of the mineral oils.
In the past, red diesel was used for specific legally defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.
This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.
The abolition of red diesel was aimed at reducing the public deficit, simplifying the system of taxation of mineral oils and reducing the administrative burden on the businesses concerned.
In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel retailer.
The purpose of this legal amendment was to introduce a record-keeping obligation for all service stations.
Making the movement of taxed petrol and diesel more transparent is linked to the obligation to buy petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.
New institutes of tax entities were introduced in 2014, namely the distributor of motor fuels and the consumer of motor fuels.
This change has contributed to eliminating the emergence of tax evasion for petrol and diesel and has clarified the movement of these propellants (see Annex 4, Schedule A).
As part of the fight against tax evasion, the legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils have been extended.
However, in SR, these mineral oils are not subject to the indication requirement.
Excise Duty on Tobacco Products
As part of the fight against tax evasion and monitoring of the tobacco raw material, the scope of the Tobacco Ingredient Act has been extended and a new tax entity - the tobacco trader - has been introduced.
Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.
Furthermore, an obligation to register technological equipment for the manufacture of tobacco products has been introduced.
The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks for the labelling of consumer packages of tobacco products.
Cigarettes, cigarillos and tobacco are marked with a check mark.
Under the new system, the purchaser of the surveillance stamps must apply electronically to the customs office to issue the surveillance stamps, using an information system for the collection of the surveillance stamps.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax authority.
One state stamp printing house was set up - in the Kremnice Mint.
The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of surveillance stamps has also been introduced.
The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.
The new system for printing control stamps strengthens the system for checking goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the control stamp to simply verify that goods come from legal sources.
The unique 12-digit identification number (1st to 2nd place is the checksum; 3. place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4th place is the series identifier; 5th to 8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9-12. instead is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional bar code.
The control mark intended for the labelling of cigarettes shall also bear the price of cigarettes, the mark for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in consumer packs and the length of cigarettes.
Excise duty on alcoholic beverages
The biggest legislative change affected alcohol, wine and beer, as the original three substantive law provisions were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.
The law was drafted mainly because of the need for a comprehensive solution to alcoholic beverage taxation, solutions to their production, monitoring of movement, ensuring tax, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, streamline the administration of the tax, reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.
A new way of tackling the issue of the taxation of different types of alcoholic beverages introduced the application of a uniform rate of excise duty to alcoholic beverages and took into account the percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength.
For still wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the final product shall be taken into account.
The concentration of beer is also expressed as a percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the finished product.
A category of small-scale fermented beverage producer has been introduced, the essence of which is to exempt from excise duty a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented beverage for his own consumption and for the consumption of his household of not more than 1 000 litres per marketing year.
The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks for the labelling of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
Under the new system, the purchaser of the surveillance stamps must apply electronically to the customs office to issue the surveillance stamps, using an information system for the collection of the surveillance stamps.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax authority.
One state stamp printing house was set up - in the Kremnice Mint.
The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of surveillance stamps has also been introduced.
The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Schedule B) and the elimination of falsification of control stamps.
The new system for printing control stamps strengthens the system for checking goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the control stamp to simply verify that goods come from legal sources.
The unique 12-digit identification number (1st to 2nd place is the checksum; 3. place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4th place is the series identifier; 5th to 8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9-12. instead is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional bar code.
Comparison and Evaluation
Comparison
Excise taxes on ethyl alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common law No 353/2003 Coll.
The solid fuel tax, the tax on natural gas and certain other gases and the tax on electricity are part of Act No 261/2007 Coll.
In the SR, by contrast, every excise duty is regulated by a special law, apart from the Alcoholic Beverages Excise Tax Act, which contains a tax on ethyl alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.
A separate law regulates excise duties on electricity, coal and natural gas.
In the Czech Republic, from 1.1.2015, the issuance of an authorisation to dispose of products subject to excise duty under the Law on Excise Duties is subject, among other things, to proof of the economic stability of the applicants, which is verified annually by the customs authorities by carrying out a financial analysis.
In the RS, a similar form of analysis is undertaken only when deciding to waive or reduce the collateral tax.
The FŘ SR carries out tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the finance directorate over the handling of the control marks for the marking of alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printing works and their sale to individual customers.
The law provides that Mincovna Kremnica, a state-owned company, is to produce the inspection marks.
The production of tobacco stickers and check strips in the Czech Republic is not supervised by the customs authorities at the printer.
Tobacco stickers and check bands will be taken from the printer by the competent territorial office of the Kutna customs office.
Tobacco labels are taken over by their customers in this territorial location, surveillance tapes to mark the ethyl alcohol are further distributed to individual locally competent tax authorities according to the location of the markings.
The Czech legislation does not define the manufacturers of tobacco stickers and check bands.
In the Slovak Republic there is an obligation to register technological installations for the production of tobacco products or parts thereof, in the Czech Republic there is no such obligation.
In the Czech Republic, the tobacco label bears excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when the tobacco stickers are removed from the competent customs office.
In SR, on the other hand, the control mark does not include excise duty on tobacco products.
A refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced in the Czech Republic during the audited period for their use for agricultural plant primary production, so-called green diesel.
As of 2017, this tax refund was extended to livestock production.
In the SR, such support for farmers is not in place (it existed until 31.12.2010 as so-called red diesel).
In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a bond of CZK 20 million (i.e. €740,000) has been introduced in the Czech Republic for fuel distributors.
As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1,891 in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1,717 tax entities).
In the SR, a similar fuel distributor is introduced, but without the deposit needed to ensure excise duty on mineral oils.
In SR, 303 distributors were registered in 2014 and 407 distributors were registered in 2015.
In SR, there is an institute of fuel retailer and fuel consumer, which is licensed by the local competent customs office.
There is no such institute in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils are subject to labelling, as well as some other mineral oils; in the Slovak Republic, following the abolition of so-called red diesel, the labelling of mineral oils is not applied.
In the Czech Republic, the surveillance tape for the marking of spirit contains an eight-digit individual code to verify the origin of spirit and a 12-digit registration code indicating the spirit spirit level under which the record of surveillance tapes is kept.
The destruction, loss and return of the surveillance tape shall be entered in the register on the following working day.
The holder of the tape shall also be required to notify its use within the same time limit.
In SR, the control mark for the labelling of ethyl alcohol in a consumer pack contains a unique 12-digit identification number which, if used, is communicated to the tax authorities once a month and is used to check the authenticity of the control mark.
The register contains the number of control marks taken, used and returned.
Both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have introduced the institute of compulsory registration or registration of the distributor of alcohol.
In SR, registration is subject to conditions relating, inter alia, to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol of at least €100 000 or paid-up capital of at least €100 000; minimum number of 10 employees.
In the Czech Republic, obtaining registration is subject, among other things, to a deposit of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) in favour of the tax administration for the entire duration of the registration.

In the RS, the production of ethyl alcohol, not only in consumer packaging, requires the permanent presence of the tax authorities.
In the Czech Republic, the production of ethyl alcohol in a consumer pack requires a special form of registration of the person required to mark ethyl alcohol, with a condition of bail in favour of the tax authorities of between CZK 100,000 (i.e. €3,700) and CZK 5,000 (i.e. €185,000) according to the quantity of control tapes taken and the installation of a tracking device with continuous access by the tax authorities.
Evaluation
The legislation of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic goes far beyond the EU's minimum requirements for the object and management of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States as well as those identified in tax territories.
Legislative changes adopted during the audited period allow tax administrations to do more to prevent the emergence of possible tax evasion.
In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, as part of the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw material (e.g. leaves), excise duty on raw tobacco and tobacco raw material was introduced in addition to EU legislation.
Although neither raw tobacco nor tobacco raw material is a harmonised tobacco product, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic monitor their movements.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic may recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.
In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that checking economic stability for applicants for authorisation under the Excise Tax Act has worked well because it reduces the risks of tax arrears.
For this reason, both supervisory institutions recommend applying such screening also in SR conditions.
The distribution of control stamps is more efficient in SR than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden customs with the costs related to transportation between the printer and the purchaser of control tapes and tobacco stickers.
The SR's financial administration has a better understanding of the existence and location of technological equipment for the manufacture of tobacco products.
In the Czech Republic, however, the levying of the tax on tobacco products is more efficient, as the order of the tobacco sticker itself is a tax return with subsequent payment of the tax.
The financial administration in the Slovak Republic has a better overview of the sales points for propellants, thanks to the introduction of the "seller of propellants" and "consumer of propellants" institutes.
The introduction of mandatory labelling of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the misuse of mineral oils at a reduced rate of tax, or exempt from tax.
In the Czech Republic (2013) and SR (2014), a new check tape or stamp containing an identification code was introduced.
The surveillance tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in the Slovak Republic the new legislation has abandoned its introduction.
Impacts cannot yet be assessed due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.
The introduction of effective labelling of the consumer packaging of alcohol with a control mark or tape is an effective measure to combat tax evasion.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic can also recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States.
The SR's position on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterised by a pro-ient approach that does not block tax entities' funds.
By contrast, the CR's approach is rather restrictive, since it introduces a bail-in weighing on the cash flow of tax entities, but it reduces the risk of tax arrears more.
Development of excise revenue
An excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the State to increase the revenue of the State budget and also to regulate the amount of goods sold whose consumption is considered harmful to individuals and/or to society (the regulatory function of the tax).
According to the Communication from the Commission: EUROPE 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3.3.2010 under the Resource Efficient Europe flagship initiative, the European Commission intends to improve the framework for the use of market-based instruments, including by revising energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.
To achieve the EC's aim, Member States should seek to shift the tax burden from labour to energy and environmental taxation, among other things, as part of a greater "greening" of tax systems.
The collection of tax revenue from excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic includes the collection of excise duty on mineral oils, tobacco products, ethyl alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.
The share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP is also monitored by, among others, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Both supreme audit institutions used the following selection criteria to query the OECD website.
Collection of excise duties linked to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP fell slightly, according to OECD data.
The European Central Bank's rate of exchange was used to convert the amounts in CZK into € on the 31st 12th of the relevant year.
The denomination of CZK against €1 in 2013 weakened by 9.1% year-on-year against 2012 (from 25.140 to 27.425).
This was mainly due to the monetary policy decision of the CNB Bank Board on 7 November 20136.
The resulting values of excise collection, excise rates and per capita income in € have decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.
The significant reduction in the share of excise duties in 2014 was due to a one-off revenue shortfall from excise duties on tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of old-rate tobacco products.
The share of excise duties is also affected by a rise in revenue tax collection, which has grown significantly due to the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.
Excise duties on mineral oils account for the largest share of total excise collections (about 55.7% in 2015), but this has fallen despite significant growth in the economy compared to 2012.
The collection of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although registration of fuel distributors was introduced in 2013 as a measure against tax fraud.
The trend of eco-efficient vehicles and the promotion of biofuels are negatively impacting the tax's revenue.
A negligible proportion are the natural gas tax, the solid fuel tax and the electricity tax, which is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU, compared to the surrounding states.
In the absence of a rate increase, their share will decline in the future in view of the ever-decreasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.
The collection of excise duty on ethyl alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the repercussions of a massive case of tax fraud involving the putting into circulation of untaxed ethyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol containing methanol or an under-denatured ethyl alcohol in the form of spirits.
In 2015, following the adoption of a series of measures against such behaviour and the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the 2012 recovery by €4m.
The share of tax on tobacco products has increased as a result of increasing rates.
The basic rates of excise duties varied between 2012 and 2015 for the tax on manufactured tobacco, where the rate was increased mainly to comply with Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty on manufactured tobacco.
As a result of the CNB's currency intervention, the real rate of excise duties in €, excluding the tax on tobacco products, has fallen significantly. For tobacco products, it has risen only slightly.
In relation to price growth, GDP or living standards, the indexation of the excise rate is not set, so the excise duties function of regulating socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.
As the Czech Republic's economic growth and living standards rise, real excise rates fall.
7 Indexation – automatic adjustment of a certain economic quantity for inflation, this adjustment is made on the basis of a law or a contract (in the case of pensions paid by the State, this is called indexation).
Collection of excise duties linked to macroeconomic indicators in SR
In the current legislation on excise duties in the Slovak Republic, the indexation of the level of excise rates to the evolution of consumer prices is not addressed because they are fixed.

Of all the excise taxes introduced in Slovakia, it is the excise duty on mineral oils that accounts for the largest share of the national budget's full-year tax revenue, with the proportion not falling below 52% over the whole period audited.
The second largest share is accounted for by excise duties on tobacco products.
This tax accounts on average for around 32% of total excise collection.
Between 2012 and 2015 there was an increase in the collection of excise duty per capita of SR.
This development is due to a rise in excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption by the population in a given year.
The growth in excise collection per capita of SR is constant and corresponds to the evolution of excise rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
In the Czech Republic, the reduction in income in € per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention on the currency rate of the crown against the euro.
The difference between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which is about 2.7 and 2.8 times higher in the Czech Republic, respectively, but per capita of the Czech Republic the collection is already only about 1/3 higher for these selected products.
This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower rates of excise taxes in the Czech Republic and the price of CZK against the € for foreign consumers.
For the mineral oil tax, the cause is also greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.
In the case of the tax on tobacco products, increasing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a not insignificant effect.
Evaluation Real rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic were falling as a result of the CNB's interventions.
The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in total tax revenues is not rising and there is no shift away from labour taxation to taxation of consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.
However, the figures achieved for the share of excise duties have consistently been above the OECD average.
The overall collection of excise duties is influenced in particular by the change in excise rates, the development of economic condition and the behaviour of the population.
Future shortfalls in the collection of excise duties due to environmental measures, which are subsidised by the state in various forms, will need to be compensated by other revenues or reductions in state spending.
In the absence of indexation of excise rates in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, their regulatory function is reduced and there is insufficient support for the EU's objectives of making Europe less dependent on environmentally harmful sources and reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco.
The higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic translates into higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of selected products in €.
Administrative expenditure of excise duties
The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and revenue related to the management of excise duties, i.e. it expresses the level of expenditure per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).
The higher the resulting value, the worse the administrative cost effectiveness.
The efficiency of the tax administration affects the scope and organisational set-up of the tax administration, the management of the organisation, the legal environment and the level of computerisation of the various activities.
The calculation of the administrative cost effectiveness of the tax administration by the conversion rate method is based on the number of employees involved in the management of excise duties in a line-managed structure.
In the Czech Republic, the management of excise duties is carried out, among other activities, by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organisational arm of the state and an entity.
In the Slovak Republic, the tax is managed by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, with customs authorities being the internal organisational unit, costs and revenues are included in aggregate for the whole organisational unit.
Therefore, in view of the possibility to compare the efficiency of excise administration, the expenses and revenues of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were also included in the calculation of administrative cost efficiency.
Administrative costs of excise administration in the Czech Republic
The Administration of Excise Duties is a complex of administrative tasks carried out mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
Some partial control tasks are carried out by other public authorities, but their importance is negligible.
In particular, excise duties are administered by the following departments:
Directorate General of Customs
Department 23 TAX
Division 231 - Tax Methodologies monitors and proposes legislative measures, provides interpretation of legislation, methodically manages and coordinates: the execution of tax administration and related regulatory agendas, in particular tax management and related control and oversight activities, the administration of transport of selected products;
Unit 232 - ELO and search performs searches and methodically manages traffic controls for selected products and ensures international ELO and EMCS cooperation;
Unit 233 - Tax Controls methodically manages and coordinates the execution of the tax control agenda at customs offices;
Department 30
Unit 301 — Legal carries out methodological work in the areas of administrative punishment, administrative procedure, tax inspection process, registration procedure, declaratory proceedings, payment of taxes, fines for late claims of tax, penalties and interest;
Unit 302 — Administrative Activities carries out decision-making in cases where the legislation provides for the remit of the DG, e.g. deciding on the delegation of the entity's territorial jurisdiction to another materially competent tax authority, deciding on the attraction, i.e. taking over the matter from a higher tax authority, appealing against customs decisions and examining incentives for inaction in tax and administrative procedures;
Unit 303 — Revenue and Enforcement Administration methodically manages, coordinates and performs international cooperation tasks in recovering tax arrears and carrying out insolvency-related tasks;
Department 60 ANALYSIS AND INFORMATION AID

Unit 604 - Financial Analysis carries out financial analysis in the customs administration, in particular in the context of the authorisation procedure.
Customs offices carry out agenda activities at various points in the county, and even agendas are dispersed in multiple locations:
Unit 02 — Analysis and information support which carries out risk analysis, risk profile management and the collection and evaluation of information from all available information sources;
Department 1
Division 11 — Legal and administrative activities, which handles supporting documents, opinions and submissions to the Appellate Body, issues authorisation decisions in relation to the administration of excise duties and environmental taxes, the Law on compulsory marking of ethyl alcohol and the Law on ethyl alcohol, decides on securing payment for a tax not yet due or not yet determined;
Department 3 - TAX
Division 31 - Tax which carries out the agendas: tax supervision of taxable entities, e.g. monitoring of compliance with the conditions laid down in the permits issued, supervision of the functionality and correctness of the production equipment for the production of ethyl alcohol and the determination of the quantity and concentration of the produced ethyl alcohol, professional supervision of the denaturing of ethyl alcohol, physical checks on the management of excise duties; non-tax checks on controls on the basis of laws having an indirect relationship with excise duties, in particular the control of the compulsory labelling and colouring of selected mineral oils, control of the taxation of selected products, control of the marking of tobacco products, control of the sale by means of the Law on fuel, and other acts of goods are carried out in connection with the Law on free movement of goods; registration of economic operators for taxes, registration of persons obliged to mark ethyl alcohol and of distributors of ethyl alcohol, and registration of fuel distributors; tax administration, in particular the conduct of the tax procedure on assessment and prescription, where applicable refund, monitoring of the tax collateral and its use to pay the tax, conducting searches;
Division 39 - Tobacco stickers and check tapes - is the organisational unit of the Central Bohemian Customs Office and carries out activities in ordering, manufacturing and distributing and disposing of tobacco stickers and check tapes.
For the disposal of returned/damaged tobacco labels, both Customs and DG representatives are present to oversee the disposal process and to draw up a record of the disposal.
For control tapes for the marking of ethyl alcohol, the director of the customs office shall appoint a three-person panel for the disposal of discarded non-removed/returned control tapes by shredding by internal management act.
After the physical shredding of the surveillance tapes has been carried out, the chairman of the winding-up board shall ensure that the details of the destroyed surveillance tapes are recorded;
Department 5 - CONTROL,
Division 52 - Tax Inspections carries out tax inspections;
Department 6 - SUPERVISION
Unit 61 — Supervision of entities is supervised by entities at points of sale, e.g. control of the sale of spirits and tobacco products;
Unit 62 - Mobile Surveillance carries out traffic control of selected products en route.
Administrative costs of excise administration in SR
Since 1.1.2012, the Finance Directorate of the Slovak Republic has undergone a challenging transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme.
The creation of the PŘ SR was also reflected in the staff mix of the newly formed departments of the merged customs and tax administration.
In the context of the performance of excise management, excise management activities within the organisational structure of the FŘ SR have been integrated into a larger number of different sections and related departments.
Finance Directorate of the Slovak Republic Customs and Taxation Section FŘ SR Excise Duties Department (Slovak-wide scope):
excise departments - guide and coordinate excise management activities; draw up expert opinions; submit proposals and comments on legislative changes; issues decisions on the delegation of territorial jurisdiction to tax entities; assigns and deletes registration sampling numbers;
Tax Supervisory Unit — directs and coordinates activities in the exercise of fiscal supervision and control; exercises fiscal supervision;
ELO and SPD systems unit — directs and coordinates administrative mutual cooperation activities in the field of excise duties, including exchange of information through SEED and MVS systems; provides management and updating in SysNeD and EMCS application equipment;
Control Marks Department – regulates printing activities and handling of control marks; exercises fiscal supervision over the handling and disposal of printing sheets and control marks in the printing works.
Vice President of Financial Management
Excise and Customs Remedies Department (Slovakia-wide scope):
excise appeals unit — reviews customs decisions on the basis of regular and extraordinary appeals made; appeal procedure at the second stage of the decision-making process.
A section of customs offices was created in the course of 2012; under it were directly incorporated individual customs offices (9 customs offices) which have a territorial scope determined by higher territorial units, with the exception of one customs office which was established, inter alia, to carry out tasks in relation to the external border of the Community.
Customs offices:
excise departments — carrying out methodological activities in relation to customs offices' branches and customs offices' stations; for the selected entities, the direct actions of the tax administration are determined by the registration (tax warehouse, beneficiary recurring, registered shipper), the amount of the tax collateral, the determination and refund of the tax, the tax supervision and the tax control; decides to waive the deposit of the tax collateral; Decides to waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee in a tax warehouse for ethyl alcohol;
legal department - decision-making activities on tax infringements; activities relating to ordinary and extraordinary remedies; tax execution procedures;
Customs office branch - decides on registration (except for tax warehouse, receiver, registered consignor), the amount of tax collateral; prescribes and refunds tax; performs tax oversight and fiscal control; decides on the security and forfeiture of goods;
Customs office station — exercise of fiscal supervision over the possession and movement of goods subject to excise duties; Ensuring the exercise of permanent tax supervision in a tax warehouse for ethyl alcohol; deciding on the security and forfeiture of goods.
Spending by the SR's financial administration on excise management is growing steadily as, with the exception of wage increases, investments are increasing to manage taxes efficiently and electronicalise the financial administration.
Although excise revenue grew, spending grew faster as a result of IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project.
In the Slovak Republic, wage expenditure is significantly affected by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol, which is not applied by the Czech Republic.
Expenditure by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on excise management increased more significantly between 2012 and 2015 in 2015, mainly due to an increase in wage expenditure and expenditure on technical support.
In the Czech Republic, revenues from excise taxes also grew at about the same rate.
Wage expenditure in the Czech Republic is positively influenced by the wider competencies of the customs administration, e.g. weighing of trucks, checking the fulfilment of duties related to the myth, compared to the SR.
Administrative cost efficiency in SR shows a slightly worsening trend year-on-year.
The number of employees did not change significantly, but spending per employee increased.
In the Czech Republic, too, the number of employees did not change significantly, but spending per employee grew more slowly compared to the Slovak Republic.
Evaluation
In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, wage growth is a major factor in the deterioration of administrative expenditure efficiency, which can be seen as a natural development.
In both countries, maintaining a high administrative burden in excise management seems to be a negative factor, as confirmed by the shrinking number of staff in excise management.
In the SR, however, managing excise duties at lower incomes is significantly more challenging for staffing capacity.
Performance indicators of excise administration
The management of excise duties is a set of activities aimed at correctly identifying, determining and securing the payment of the tax.
The main processes in the management of excise duties are tax assessment, authorisation and registration, transport supervision, control and search of tax subjects.
Numbers of administrative tasks and entities managed are indicators of the performance of the tax administration.
The correlation between the observed indicator and the number of tax administrations expresses the efficiency of the tax administration's activities and defines the cost of a particular activity.
Authorisation and registration for the activity are essential preconditions for the handling and transport of selected products for commercial purposes under a conditional exemption scheme.
The tax authorities are required to perform a systematic administration of authorised or registered entities, with a focus on supervising compliance with the legislation and conditions laid down by the tax authorities, to which adequate staffing resources must be allocated.
The observed indicator was the number of valid permits or registrations for activity at 31 December of each year.
The number of permits or registrations issued is not the same as the number of tax entities.
Administrative acts are concrete administrative acts on the merits.
The administrative acts monitored are the frequency of the most significant actions of the tax administration (tax claims, traffic administration in EMCS), or those that are a sequence of actions ending in a report or decision.
Performance indicators in the Czech Republic
Permission and registration for activities in the Czech Republic
Tax warehouse:
The products selected may be manufactured, processed, stored, received or dispatched with the permission of the tax authorities to operate a tax warehouse.
If the operator of the tax warehouse has multiple warehouses, a permit shall be issued for each separately, including securing the tax.
Tax security is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administration (i.e. the physical presence of the official and the securing of the equipment by the tax administration's accounts).
Permanent tax supervision is not applied in the Czech Republic.
The tax warehouse operator also registers for tax under Section 125 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.
An authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products, conditionally exempt from tax, from the place of importation to a tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in another Member State, to the place of exportation in another Member State or to a consignee in another Member State (replacing the status of registered consignor under Article 4(10) of Council Directive 2008/118/EC).
Tax warehouse statistics do not include permits for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels, excluding tax, which are analogous to tax warehouse permits.
Growing spirit produces alcohol at a reduced 50% tax rate (£14,300/hl ethanol) — fruit spirits for growers. It is not a tax warehouse and operating permits are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.
The reduced rate of tax can be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per household of a grower destined for personal consumption for the production period (July-June).
The register of cultivation burning, kept by the operators of the brandy and made available to the tax authorities, must include details of the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.
A beneficiary for re-receipt of selected products and a beneficiary for one-off receipt of selected products shall be entitled, subject to the authorisation of the tax authorities and the conditions laid down, to receive or re-receive selected products on a one-off basis under a conditional system shipped from another Member State.
The beneficiary is not the operator of the tax warehouse and may not store or dispatch the selected products under the conditional exemption scheme.
The user of the selected tax-exempt products is the legal or natural person who accepts and uses, or sells the selected tax-exempt products to another user, according to §§ 52a or §53 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.; users have the status of tax entities without the obligation to register for tax.
Exempt products selected may be accepted and used only on the basis of a valid authorisation, and only from the supplier indicated in the authorisation.
On the basis of the authorisation, exempt mineral oils may be sold to another authorisation holder or user who is authorised to use mineral oils without authorisation.
Mineral oils may be sold exempt without a licence in statutory cases, e.g.:
waste oils in quantities of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year, if produced by the user himself or generated by his activity,
Selected mineral oils exempt from tax in unit packets of not more than 20 litres for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat production, and for sale at the same time to the final consumer.
Selected exempt products may be transported with proof of exemption.
The distributor of the consumer-packaged spirit shall be entitled, after compulsory registration with the tax authorities, to sell or otherwise transfer the ethyl alcohol put into free circulation for tax purposes.
A storer of raw tobacco is entitled to store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, subject to registration with the tax authorities and the conditions laid down.
A person handling special mineral oils shall be entitled to acquire, sell or otherwise transfer special mineral oils which are in bulk or placed in packaging exceeding 220 litres, on the basis of registration with the tax authorities and subject to specified conditions.
The fuel distributor is entitled to sell fuel in the territory of the Czech Republic, except for the sale of fuel from a service station, on the basis of the concession issued and the registration of the tax administrator under specified conditions.
The PHM transport must be accompanied by a tax document, proof of sale or proof of transport, where appropriate, a distribution plan and bottling vouchers.
These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent by the tax authorities before the transport begins.
The service station operator is the owner of the fuel sold at the service station.
Petrol stations are places where the sale or delivery of PHMs is permitted, as a general rule, to the fuel tank, subject to a permit from the building authority.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade records petrol stations and their operators with a breakdown into: registered - normal sale or delivery of PHMs generally to vehicle fuel tanks; with a defined approach - operating generally in different business premises (e.g. quarries, sawmills, farm farms, transport organisations, construction yards), sales here are limited to the other party based on specific contractual relations; non-public - fuel outlets only for operators' own consumption.
A service station is not a construction or installation in the form of an operating tank located in service (e.g. on a chassis) if the fuel is only issued for own use.
Operating tanks are not subject to the tax authority's authorisation and are not registered.
Natural and juridical persons may purchase, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases put into free circulation for resale on the authorisation of the tax authorities.
They must also be authorised when buying or obtaining liquefied petroleum gases for their own consumption exceeding 20 tonnes per calendar year.
Administrative tasks in the Czech Republic
Tax control is a set of operations. Tax control shall cover tax obligations, claims made by the taxpayer or other circumstances relevant to the correct determination and determination of the tax relating to a single tax proceeding.
Tax control can be carried out jointly for multiple tax procedures of a single tax entity.
Repeated tax inspections may only be carried out under the conditions laid down by law and on the grounds when the inspection is initiated.
Tax control is carried out within a tax-setting period of three years, with the deadline extended by one year under the conditions laid down by law (e.g. filing additional tax proceedings, launching criminal proceedings in relation to the tax in question), or suspended (legal proceedings, international cooperation).
The period for determining the tax shall end not later than 10 years after the expiry of the period for making a proper tax claim.
There is no obligation on the tax authorities to carry out a tax audit on each taxpayer.
The commencement of the tax inspection suspends the deadlines for the possibility of the tax entity submitting a supplementary tax return or a supplementary statement (§ 141 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.) and restarts the deadline for determining the tax (§ 148 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).
On the basis of its result, the tax may be levied ex officio.
A local investigation is an individual time-limited act (one day) in which the tax administration searches for evidence and inspects premises, goods, documents, registers, means of transport and transport packaging at tax agencies and other persons involved in the tax administration, on the spot outside the premises of the tax administration (e.g. tax entity, point of sale, transport journey).
The tax authorities shall be entitled to borrow documents and items, to take samples and, where appropriate, to secure them.
On the basis of the outcome of the local investigation, the tax cannot be assessed separately, but the taxpayer can be invited to submit a supplementary tax return (§ 145(2) of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).
Checking traffic data in EMCS is not a local investigation.
Ordering surveillance tapes to mark ethyl alcohol can only be made by the registered person required to mark ethyl alcohol to the tax authorities of the locally relevant place of marking, and is done through intelligent forms that are automatically imported into the application of the ethyl alcohol mark register.
The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the amount of control tapes ordered and orders the production.
He doesn't oversee the production of surveillance tapes.
Production is provided by the State Printing House of Cenin, a state-owned enterprise.
The customer of the check tapes shall take the check tapes to the tax authority of the locally relevant marking point.
Ordering tobacco stickers to mark cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and smoking tobacco serves as a tax declaration.
The value of the tobacco sticker shall correspond to the amount of the tax liability, with the purchaser of the tobacco stickers being required to pay their value within 60 days of the date of their removal from the tax administration.
The customer is obliged to calculate in the order itself the value corresponding to the tax liability of the tobacco stickers ordered.
This time limit only applies if the value of the tobacco stickers is ensured.
The order for the tobacco stickers shall be made on a form established by the Ministry of Finance in writing or by means of a data container with the possibility of using intelligent forms.
Manufacture of tobacco stickers is provided by the State Printing Company, a state-owned company.
The trustee of the tax, which is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region (Kutná Hora's territorial site), ensures the purchase and transport of the tobacco stickers to the tax authorities, who distribute them and further examine their transport, storage and use with customers.
Tax claims include regular tax returns, additional and corrective tax returns, including orders for tobacco stickers, filed by tax entities.
Included is not the declaration of tax under customs procedure based on customs declarations and the declaration of claims for repayment of tax on: mineral oils used for the production of heat, other petrol used in the course of business other than for the production of heat or the propulsion of engines, mineral oils used for primary agricultural production.
The fines imposed include an administrative procedure to deal with the infringements identified, a set of successive administrative actions. The International Exchange of Information on Tax Entities (ELO) within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes the form of: a request for administrative cooperation, replies to a request for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, incident reports, inspection reports.
Transport taking place under the conditional exemption regime between the Czech Republic and EU Member States - the Czech customs office is the tax administration of the receiving or dispatching tax warehouse or the authorised consignee.
Performance indicators in SR
Permission and registration to operate in SR
The management of excise duties in SR is primarily ensured by the customs offices and the excise department of the Customs and Tax Division of the FŘ SR, whose procedure for the administration of excise duties is governed by the various laws on excise duties and the tax code.
These laws lay down not only the scope of authorisation for the CA and the FŘ SR to administer excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax subjects in relation to registration or payment of excise duty.
The largest year-on-year increase in tax entities (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, driven by an increase in tax warehouse permits issued, an increase in registrations of the authorised beneficiary for re-admission and the registration of a large number of user businesses.
The legislation clarified the transport of certain bulk mineral oils, as well as the notification requirement if they are transported in bulk or in packaging of more than 150 litres and 230 litres respectively, and also extended the list of mineral oils that are subject to control and transport procedure to other goods, such as anti-knock motor products, oxidation inhibitors, bitumen inhibitors, viscosity enhancers, anti-corrosive products.
A mandatory indication regarding the indication of their kinematic viscosity has been introduced for lubricating oils.
An approximation of the registration process with selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the SR is provided in the following sections of the document.
Tax warehouse operator
Under national SR legislation, when registering a tax warehouse operator in respect of all excise goods, a person wishing to operate a tax warehouse must also apply for registration and authorisation to operate a tax warehouse at the same time.
The resulting decision in the registration process is the certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty by which the tax warehouse operator acquires legal personality for all tax warehouses.
At the same time, the CA issues a tax warehouse permit authorising the tax warehouse operator in that tax warehouse to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under a duty suspension arrangement.
Where a tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in multiple locations, the tax authorities shall issue a separate tax warehouse permit for each tax warehouse.
The transport of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement is monitored electronically by EMCS.
A unique reference code is generated for each transport, the so-called
An ARC code under which said shipments can be monitored online and therefore in real time.
Where the tax warehouse operator is also the person authorised to distribute the ethyl alcohol, he shall notify the CA electronically of the trade name of the consumer packaging of the ethyl alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of the ethyl alcohol in the consumer packaging of the ethyl alcohol and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free tax circulation, no later than the date of its release.
Registered sender
A registered consignor is a special type of taxpayer who cannot also be registered as a tax warehouse operator at the same time, even if he dispatches a subject of excise duty under a duty suspension arrangement after his release for free circulation.
Under national SR legislation, when registering a registered consignor in respect of all excise goods, a person wishing to dispatch an excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement after their release for free circulation must also apply to the CA at the same time for registration and authorisation to dispatch an excise object under that arrangement.
The CA issues a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, while also issuing an authorisation to dispatch the excise object under the duty suspension arrangement after its release for free circulation.
Growing spirit
The basic act for the operation of growing brandy is to obtain authorisation for the production of alcohol at the distillery plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.
However, the permit itself from the Ministry does not entitle the holder of the licence to practice cultivation brandy.
In order to be able to practise cultivation brandy, a person must apply to the CA to register and issue a certificate of registration as a producer brandy operator.
The CA issues a registration certificate for the relevant excise duty, which also entitles the operator of the producer brandy to produce ethyl alcohol in the producer brandy.
The purpose of cultivation brandy is to provide services to growers.
Growing spirit cannot be a tax warehouse.
The legislature allows a reduced rate of tax to be applied to ethyl alcohol produced in cultivation brandy, at 50% of the basic rate of tax, i.e. 540 €/hl a.
The reduced rate of tax shall be applied to ethyl alcohol produced in cropping spirit at a maximum quantity of 43 litres a. per grower and his household per production period in the tax territory.
The production period runs from 1 July of the current year to 30 June of the following year.
The production period is not the same as the calendar year and therefore a reduced rate of tax can be applied to the ethyl alcohol produced more than once per calendar year, as the ethyl alcohol is produced in two production periods.
It is the production of ethyl alcohol outside the conditional exemption scheme, which in practice means that the ethyl alcohol produced is in free tax circulation.
The grower pays not only excise duty and value added tax to the grower's distillery for the ethyl alcohol produced, but also the price for the services provided.
The crop brandy issues the grower with a removal certificate, which serves not only as proof of the origin and method of obtaining the ethyl alcohol, but also as proof of payment of the excise duty.
Transportation of the ethyl alcohol thus produced is not subject to monitoring by the tax authorities.
Consumer Packaging Importer
National legislation allows persons intending to import consumer packs of ethyl alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third country as part of a business and to place them in free tax circulation in the tax territory to apply to the CA for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packs.
The importer of the consumer packaging does not register for the relevant excise duty, but the CA issues him a certificate of registration as a importer of the consumer packaging.
That certificate authorises the importer to import consumer packs of spirit or consumer packs of cigarettes from the territory of a third country.
At the same time, he must lodge a tax guarantee on the amount of tax attributable to the quantity of ethyl alcohol or cigarettes he wishes to put into free circulation before the control marks are issued.
The importer of a consumer pack must release for free tax circulation only a consumer pack marked with a control mark.
For this reason, they must submit to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the surveillance marks exported to the territory of the third country.
On importation, the importer shall have the number of surveillance stamps imported back from the territory of a third country confirmed by the customs office of importation.
On importation of consumer packaging, the importer shall proceed in accordance with the customs legislation, where the amount of excise duty shall also form part of the customs debt.
In the event of the release for free circulation of the consumer package, the tax guarantee lodged shall be returned to the importer or may be used to pay a customs debt.
The importer of consumer packaging is not a tax warehouse.
Where the importer of a consumer pack of ethyl alcohol is also the person authorised to distribute ethyl alcohol, he shall notify the CA electronically of the trade name of the consumer pack of ethyl alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer pack of ethyl alcohol and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer pack which he puts into free tax circulation, no later than the date of its release.
Seller of consumer alcohol packaging in free tax circulation
In order to monitor the movement of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, the legislature has introduced a new tax institute of the seller of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
A person wishing to hold a permit for sale must apply to the CA for a permit and fulfil the legal conditions (business license for commercial activity; integrity in relation to intentional economic crimes; has not had its marketing authorisation withdrawn for ten years; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).
As it is a consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of those goods.
An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the consumer packaging of the ethyl alcohol.
The holder of the authorization shall keep a calendar month record for each establishment of the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol received, the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol issued, the stock of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging on the last day of the month and a record of the shortfall or surplus in the number of consumer packages of ethyl alcohol received and issued.
The holder of the authorisation shall be obliged to purchase the ethyl alcohol in the consumer pack or otherwise take it in the course of business only from the person authorised to distribute it.
Consumer Alcohol Packaging Distributor
In order to monitor the movement of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, the legislature has introduced a new tax institute, the distributor of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
A person intending to hold a distribution permit must apply to the CA for a distribution authorisation.
The applicant must fulfil the legal conditions (a business license for a business activity; a storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol of not less than €100 000 or paid-up capital of not less than €100 000; minimum number of 10 employees; has no arrears to customs; has no arrears on compulsory contributions; integrity in relation to intentional economic crimes; has not had its marketing authorisation revoked for ten years; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).
As it is a consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of those goods.
An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation, is sufficient to prove the method of acquiring the consumer packaging of the spirit.
The holder of the distribution authorisation shall keep a calendar month record, for each establishment, of the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol received, the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol issued, the stock of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging on the last day of the month and a record of the shortfall or surplus in the number of consumer packages of ethyl alcohol received and issued.
The holder of the distribution authorisation is obliged to purchase the ethyl alcohol in the consumer package only from another person authorised to distribute it.
The person authorised to distribute shall report the data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.
Fuel Seller
A new type of tax entity, the fuel retailer, has been introduced to monitor fuel in free tax circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion.
There is no specific regulation governing petrol stations in the territory of SR.
That's why gas stations are incorporated as fuel retailers in the SR's national legislation.
A person wishing to sell petrol, diesel or LPG in free circulation for final consumption in the course of business activity in the tax territory is required to apply to the CA for a sales permit before commencement of the sale and provide proof that the storage facility is verified and equipped with an appropriate verified measuring device to measure the quantity of mineral oil when it receives and dispenses, and the tank must comply with the technical standards.
If the fuel retailer is a tax warehouse operator, authorised consignee or registered consignor, CA will also automatically issue a permit to sell fuel to registered persons.
A fuel retailer is required, among other legal obligations, to keep a register of petrol, diesel or LPG purchased and sold in a calendar month and also to notify the CA of a new fuel supplier (distributor).
A fuel retailer is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from the distributor of the fuel or from a registered person.
As the fuel is in free circulation for tax purposes, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.
However, when the propellant is delivered by means of an auto tanker, the distributor, when pumping the propellant to the dealer, prints out the so-called bottler from the measuring device incorporated in the car tank.
The document shall include, in addition to the quantity data, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the DMV.
An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the distributor of the fuel allocated by the tax authorities, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel.
The tax authorities in the territory of SR, when exercising fiscal supervision over mineral oils, record tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.
Above all, it is an effort to avoid roadside checks when transporting, so hauliers use secondary roads, circumventing the toll collection system because of the more difficult monitoring of actual transports.
Transportation of mineral oils in converted double-bottomed tanks is also carried out.
Many times, illegal shipments are accompanied by a vehicle that carriers report possible mobile patrols to change the route and avoid roadside control.
Mixing of propellants with light fuel oils or waste oils also occurs.
Fuel distributor
A new type of tax entity, the distributor of the fuel, has been introduced to monitor fuel in free tax circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion.
A person intending to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in the free tax territory as part of a business activity shall, prior to commencing distribution, apply to the customs office for a distribution permit and provide proof that the storage facility is verified and equipped with an appropriate verified measuring device, as well as a list of suppliers and purchasers.
A fuel distributor is required, among other legal obligations, to keep separate accounts for each establishment of petrol, diesel or LPG purchased and sold in a calendar month.
A fuel distributor is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise source fuel only from the distributor of the fuel or from a registered person.
A fuel distributor can only sell in the tax territory to a distributor of fuel, to a registered person or to a consumer of fuel.
However, when the fuel is supplied via an auto tanker, the distributor will print out, when the fuel is pumped, a so-called bottler from a measuring device incorporated in the car tank to the seller of the fuel or to the consumer of the fuel.
The document shall include, in addition to the quantity data, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the DMV.
As the fuel is in free circulation for tax purposes, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.
An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the distributor of the fuel or the registered person allocated by the tax authorities, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel.
Fuel Consumer
The fuel consumer has a special position in national legislation.
A person who purchases petrol, diesel or LPG in free circulation for his own consumption in the tax territory and stores that mineral oil in a storage facility of 15 000 litres or more shall notify the customs office at the latest before the first placing in the storage facility.
Fuel consumers shall be entered in the register by the customs office.
In addition to the legal facts, he is required to give the address of the location of the storage facility.
In practice, these are large transport companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.
The storage device must be verified and fitted with a measuring device enabling the amount of propellant (gauge, gauge bar) to be measured when receiving and dispensing.
The tank must meet technical standards.
The fuel consumer must purchase the fuel only from the distributor of the fuel or from a registered person.
As the fuel is in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for transportation.
However, when the propellant is delivered via an auto tanker, the distributor will print a so-called bottler from the measuring device incorporated in the auto tanker when the fuel is pumped to the consumer.
That document shall include, in addition to the quantity data, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the DMV.
An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the distributor of the fuel allocated by the tax authorities, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel.
The tax authorities in the territory of SR, when exercising fiscal supervision over mineral oils, record tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.
Small independent brewery
The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer in the course of business and meets the legal conditions.
Provided that the conditions laid down by law are met, a small independent brewery may apply a reduced rate of tax, i.e. €2,652 per hl/percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength.
Annual beer production is limited to up to 200,000 hl of beer.
As it is the production of beer outside the conditional exemption scheme, the accompanying document is not needed for transport as it is in free tax circulation.
A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.
In practice, they are small family-run businesses that also run restaurants or saloons in which they offer their own production of beer for sale.
Administrative tasks in SR
This sub-chapter approximates the exercise of excise tax administration tax supervision by selected tax entities within the meaning of the SR national legislation.
The largest year-on-year increase in administrative tasks (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, driven by more EMCS traffic.
In contrast, the biggest decrease year-on-year was in 2014, by up to 4.3%, driven by fewer tax checks completed and fewer tax returns filed.
That decrease concerned legislative changes.
Tax controls
By exercising tax control, the CA ascertains or examines the facts crucial to the correct determination of the tax.
CA staff are shown, when carrying out a tax audit, by a mandate to carry out a tax audit which includes, inter alia, the purpose and subject matter of the audit and the extent of the tax years audited.
In practice, this means that the audited tax period can be one month, but also multiple tax years.
The scope of audited tax years is determined by CA.
Tax inspection begins with the writing of the tax inspection opening minutes.
CA will confirm receipt of the documents.
Borrowed documents shall be returned to the CA within 30 days of the completion of the tax inspection.
A CA employee from the tax audit draws up a report.
If the tax audit identifies a difference in the total that the audited tax entity should have paid, declared or claimed a refund of, the CA will also send the audited tax entity a call for comments on the findings in the report, together with the report.
The tax inspection shall cease on the date of receipt of the report.
The deadline for carrying out a tax audit shall not be more than one year from the date on which it is initiated.
Tax checks on registered persons and selected registered persons shall be carried out as necessary, but at least once before the expiry date of the right to establish the tax, which is 5 years.
The FŘ SR issued an internal management act adjusting the abovementioned time limits because of the uniform procedure of the tax administration in the territory of the SR.
Local inquiries
Local inquiries are the activities of the tax authorities in which they seek evidence, examine and establish facts which are needed for tax administration purposes.
A CA employee will draw up a record of the local investigation and submit a copy to the tax entity.
When carrying out a local investigation, a CA employee has the right to unrestricted access to land, operational buildings, rooms and places including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.
The clearance of the quantities of ethyl alcohol produced shall be ascertained by means of a local investigation.
The facts established are the basis for the exercise of tax control.
Also in carrying out the local investigation, the CA is entitled to take samples as well as to safeguard the case.
The FŘ SR issued an internal management act regulating the exercise of tax supervision and local investigation for individual excise goods in order to unify the tax administration's procedures.
Permanent tax oversight in alcohol tax warehouses
With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1.5.2004, there was also a change in the field of excise management.
The need for more efficient spending of state funds in administering excise duty on ethyl alcohol, improving the business environment in the area and introducing legislative instruments to more effectively curb the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in 2004 in relation to excise duty management.
One of the measures brought about by the new legislative change was not only the transfer of the excise tax administration from the tax offices to the customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for the tax administration to be present in the alcohol tax warehouse.
In the territory of SR, national legislation defines exhaustively that it is only possible to receive, supply, produce or process alcohol in a tax warehouse in the presence of a CA employee.
This does not apply to a tax warehouse which receives, stores or dispatches ethyl alcohol only in consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
At the same time, the CA is obliged to safeguard employees in the tax warehouse in order not to restrict the receipt, supply, production or processing of ethyl alcohol.
The tax warehouse operator incurs the obligation to safeguard working environment conditions for CA staff.
Under the contract concluded with the FŘ SR for the premises provided, the CA pays the tax warehouse operator the rental costs each month.
In a tax warehouse for the production, processing or storage of ethyl alcohol, the production facilities for the storage of ethyl alcohol must be such that the quantities of ethyl alcohol produced, processed ethyl alcohol, stored ethyl alcohol, including stocks of ethyl alcohol and the alcohol contained therein, can be determined at any time.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Where ethyl alcohol is not accepted, dispensed, produced or processed in a tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee, with the obligation to secure that area by sealing the customs office.
In practice, however, this option is not used very often because tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs office employee to their advantage.
Some tax warehouse operators make use of a legal option within the meaning of Act No 467/2002 on the production and marketing of alcohol, and use the production facilities for the production of alcohol at the distillery for cultivation burning and also for the purposes of the distillery for distillates, which must be a tax warehouse.
Around 250 customs officers provide permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.
Issuing vouchers to collect alcohol control stamps
The basic procedure for collecting the control stamps is to send an application to the customs office for the allocation of a registration take-off number and the issue of a receipt for the alcohol control stamps.
Alcoholic beverage which is ethyl alcohol means goods of the Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 1,2 % vol.
The trademark is intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
A sealed consumer container filled with spirit intended for direct human consumption is regarded as a consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
Consumer packaging of Combined Nomenclature codes 2207 and 2208 may be released for free tax circulation in the tax territory only if it is marked with a control mark.
Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee and the importer of the consumer packaging, who will place it in free tax circulation, may label the consumer packaging with a control mark.
The check mark shall contain, inter alia, an identification number consisting of a 14-digit numerical character. The identification number contains the registration take-off number (1st to 6th for the numerical digit), the volume of ethyl alcohol (7th to 11th for the numerical digit) and the bulk concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer pack (12th to 14th for the numerical digit).
Original alcohol control mark pattern:
The registration take-off number shall be assigned separately by the CA to each purchaser.
Only a control mark, the identification number of which corresponds to the volume of the consumer package, the bulk concentration of the ethyl alcohol in the consumer package and the customer's control mark, may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of the ethyl alcohol.
National legislation towards the end of 2014 brought in the introduction of a new information system for check marks.
The aim of the new control mark information system was to simplify and computerise the ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of the control marks for the labelling of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee, the importer of the consumer package and the consignee (buyer) of the alcohol may label the consumer packaging with a control mark.
A trademark purchaser wishing to take control marks under the "new system" must apply electronically to the customs office for the stamps to be issued.
Through the electronic system, the purchaser of the inspection marks is obliged to request their issue, to notify the data resulting from the SR national legislation and to keep a register of the inspection marks.
The number of consignments of the inspection stamps ordered may not be less than 500 or more.
Also, the tax authorities communicate with the purchasers of the surveillance stamps through an electronic system of surveillance stamps, in particular when notifying the number of control stamps which may be withdrawn by the purchaser of the control stamps or when determining the date of acceptance of the control stamps by the purchaser of the control stamps at the printing works.
The purchaser of the vignettes shall, before accepting the vignettes, deposit into the tax authority's account the funds corresponding to the price of the vignettes which he may withdraw, the quantity of which shall be notified to him by the customs office.
The price of the control mark takes into account the amount of the printer's refunds. However, it does not take into account the level of excise duty.
Control stamps are authorised to be printed by the state-owned Mincovna Kremnice.
The FŘ SR carries out tax supervision over the handling of the inspection marks and their disposal at the printing works.
The FŘ SR is obliged to ensure the presence of a financial directorate employee in the printing works when handling the control marks.
The FŘ SR secures the sale of the control stamps to the purchaser of the control stamps at the printer.
Checkpoints can only be removed at the printer from an employee of the finance directorate.
Issuing vouchers for taking control marks for tobacco products
The collector of the control mark must request the CA to assign a registration sampling number and issue a receipt for the control mark.
A consumer pack of cigarettes can be put into free circulation only if it is marked with a control mark.
It is only possible to label the consumer pack of cigarettes with a control mark in a company that manufactures cigarettes.
Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee or the importer of tobacco products wishing to place tobacco products in free circulation in the tax territory can be a purchaser of the control stamps.
Only a control mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of cigarettes, the particulars of which correspond to the respective price of the cigarettes, the number of cigarettes in the pack, the length of the cigarettes, the tax rate validity symbol and the registration take-off number.
Consumer packs of cigarettes can only be sold for final consumption at the price indicated on the control mark.
National legislation towards the end of 2014 brought in the introduction of a new information system for check marks.
The aim of the new control mark information system was to simplify and computerise the ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of the control marks intended for the marking of consumer packages of tobacco, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.
A trademark purchaser wishing to take control marks under the "new system" must apply electronically to the customs office for the stamps to be issued.
Through the electronic system, the purchaser of the inspection marks is obliged to request their issue, to notify the data resulting from the SR national legislation and to keep a register of the inspection marks.
Control stamps are authorised to be printed by the state-owned Mincovna Kremnice.
The FŘ SR carries out tax supervision over the handling of the inspection marks and their disposal at the printing works.

A tax warehouse operator or importer of tobacco products may mark consumer tobacco packages with a control mark.
A tax warehouse operator, importer of tobacco products or authorised consignee may mark a consumer pack of cigars or cigarillos with a control mark.
Only a control mark shall be used to indicate the consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars or cigarillos, the particulars of which correspond to the validity feature of the rate of excise duty.
It is only possible to label the consumer pack of cigarettes with a control mark in the business that manufactured them.
The number of consignments of the inspection stamps ordered may not be less than 500 or more.
The CA shall, within three working days at the latest, electronically notify the buyer of the inspection marks of the number of inspection marks it may withdraw, the price of the inspection marks and the account number of the FŘ SR.
The CA may reduce the number of inspection stamp units ordered if circumstances have arisen which make it reasonable to assume that tax infringements may occur.
The FŘ SR shall determine the date of acceptance of the surveillance stamps by the buyer of the surveillance stamps, but no later than 10 days.
The date of receipt of the inspection marks shall be notified by the FŘ SR to the buyer of the inspection marks via the electronic system of inspection marks.
Surveillance stamps are issued by the finance directorate exclusively in the printing works, but only after receipt of funds corresponding to their price to the relevant account specified in the electronic notification from the customs office.
The collector of the control marks shall be required to keep separate registers of the control marks in the electronic system of the control marks, broken down for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.
Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)
Within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the ELO and SPD systems unit of the Excise Duties Division of the FŘ SR is responsible for ensuring the exchange of information upon request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the relevant financial administrations.
These include, in particular, requests to examine bodies within the excise administration, requests for information on excise administration, as well as requests to confirm information from the SEED database.
The exchange of applications takes place electronically under EMCS.
The following actions are included in the administrative cooperation between EU Member States: requests for administrative cooperation (request for screening, request for information on excise management, request for confirmation of registration in the SEED); response to a request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; event report; check report.
Comparison and Evaluation
Comparison
Authorisation and registration
In the Slovak Republic, permanent tax supervision is applied to tax warehouses for ethyl alcohol, in the Czech Republic this supervision is replaced by continuous supervision by the tax administration through a tracking device.
In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are tax warehouses, in the Slovak Republic they are only registered by the tax authorities.
In SR there is an institute of registered shipper which is included in tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.
In SR, it is possible to burn 43 l a with a reduced rate of excise duty on ethyl alcohol in case of cultivation burning.
In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the reduced rate of tax on ethyl alcohol can only be applied to 30 l a.
The growing spirit in SR must be authorised not only by the Slovak Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, but also by the tax authorities.
In the Czech Republic, only the Ministry of Agriculture allows cultivation distilleries.
In SR, the importation of consumer packs of ethyl alcohol is carried out by the importer of consumer packs of ethyl alcohol in addition to the tax warehouse operator.
The importer's authorisation is subject to the applicant being registered with the excise duty manager.
In the Czech Republic, no special permission from the tax authorities is required to import a consumer pack of ethyl alcohol.
In SR, the sale of a consumer pack of ethyl alcohol is subject to the issue of a tax administration permit to the seller.
The seller of the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep a register of, inter alia, purchases and sales.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration does not issue any permit for final sellers of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of ethyl alcohol by the trade office; the final seller does not keep any special records.
In SR, the fuel retailer must have permission from the tax authorities to sell them.
The national legislation in the Slovak Republic does not provide for any special regulation of petrol stations, all activities relating to petrol stations are governed only by the Act on Excise Duty on Mineral Oils.
In the Czech Republic, petrol stations are regulated by a special law on fuel, but the tax administrator does not issue any permit for the sale of fuel.
Petrol stations are registered and a list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
In SR, it is technically not possible to obtain a list of petrol stations from the financial management system.
In the SR, there has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.
That increase was due to a legislative change in that period.
In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits dropped significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of a bond for fuel distributors.
Administrative tasks
In the SR, substantive law provides for the obligation to exercise tax control on selected tax entities.
This issue is further specified in the internal management act issued by the FŘ SR for the purpose of applying the uniform procedure of tax administrations to the territory of the SR.
In the Czech Republic, the substantive law does not regulate the obligation to carry out a tax inspection, the procedural law only provides for the possibility of carrying out a check at the latest by the deadline for the tax assessment.
The reason for the large differences in the number of tax checks carried out and the local investigations in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is that the internal management act of the FŘ SR stipulates in which cases and within what time limits the tax authorities must carry out a tax inspection, while in the Czech Republic the correctness of the declared amount of excise duty or its reimbursement is verified in particular by the local investigation.
The number of comparable administrative actions in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 due to the increase in the number of traffic in the EMCS system and at the same time due to the increase in the number of tax returns filed.
In the SR, the number of administrative tasks between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly increasing trend, which was influenced by the increasing number of traffic in the EMCS system while decreasing the number of tax returns.
Evaluation
The large differences between the numbers of comparable permits and the registration of taxable entities were reflected in the different legislative arrangements.
The number of comparable administrative actions of tax administrations was similar in the SR and the CR in the different years of the audited period.
In the Slovak Republic, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for about the same amount of administrative operations.
It can be concluded from this that the SR is more focused on carrying out administrative tasks by tax administrations, such as the exercise of physical tax supervision.
In the Czech Republic, the emphasis is more on remote surveillance, e.g. surveillance devices, immediate data transmission via the web interface and risk analysis.
Electronisation of administrative tasks
Electronization of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic
Tax returns can be filed through a data container.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced so-called interactive tax return forms, but they can no longer be processed in an automated way.
In addition, the data must be entered into the personal tax account of the taxpayer.
The benefit is a reduction in the error rate of filed tax returns (DAPs), which saves the actions of the tax administration related to the correction procedure for erroneously filed DAPs.
DG is working on a new e-processing application for DAP.
Through intelligent forms, the following can be used: to submit tax applications or registration for activities and notifications of changes to data, to claim a refund, to fulfil reporting obligations for the handling of special mineral oils, the handling of raw tobacco and the fulfilment of biofuel obligations.
The handling of surveillance tapes is recorded by the tax subjects in the ORO WebClient information system, which is available for registration by the tax authorities of the specified data.
The transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under the conditional exemption regime must be carried out in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality in the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).
Transportation of selected products in free tax circulation within the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be carried out with a document proving their taxation, proof of excise duty exemption, decision of the customs office to place the selected products under a customs procedure, simplified accompanying document or other decision to levy excise duty.
The required data content is set by law.
To facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for the issuance of alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.).
This allows the paper form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents sent via the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic web interface to a data warehouse where each such document is assigned a unique 12-digit identification code (JIK).
The ICU serves for control purposes by the customs authorities en route and prevents repeated transport on the same document.
For the largest operator of the fuel tax warehouse in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of PHM into free circulation, CS CR has online access to an electronic filing system, into which the entity automatically stores the tax documents issued.
CS CR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. an electronic system for registering and monitoring the transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.
This system should make use of 70% of the existing EMCS functional specification.
The advantage will be a user-friendly environment for both declarants and customs officers.
It will also be linked to a system of global guarantees, a register of tax entities or a system of risk analysis.
The system should allow for an overview of transport in free circulation between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of documentary evidence without registration and the sharing of procedural numbers through simplified accompanying documents.
The risks of the current procedure for registering the transport of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in the misuse of a simplified accompanying document, the repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.
Electronisation of administrative tasks in SR
In the management of excise duties, the SR tax administration uses electronic communication to monitor the movement of goods in the EMCS system under the conditional exemption regime, the control stamps, the submission of tax returns, as well as the registration and registration of tax subjects.
A one-way electronic communication between tax entities and the tax authorities was also introduced in 2014 and extended to two-way communication in 2016.
As part of electronic communications, a personal internet zone, known as an electronic personal mailbox, is made available to the taxpayer after the entry of the access data, which is intended for communication with the financial administration.
Within this zone, the taxpayer has access to an electronic registry through which he submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents relating to the administration of excise duties.
However, electronic communication via a personal Internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.
National legislation defines tax entities that are required to communicate electronically with the tax administration.
They are mainly value added tax payers, tax advisers representing a tax entity and lawyers representing a tax entity.
The SAO also addressed the issue of the scope of electronisation of excise administration in the audit.
Only fully electronic acts were involved, namely tax returns and electronic communication within ELO.
Leaving aside the traffic carried out under EMCS, there has been an increase in the computerisation of selected comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.
Comparison and Evaluation
Comparison
In SR, a fully electronised processing of the tax return is already in place, from its filing to the registration of the tax liability.
The electronic processing of the tax return is not set up in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, the possibility is set up for tax entities to insert on the web page mandatory documents for individual transports in free tax circulation.
In the future, the reporting of transport in free tax circulation in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system is being prepared.
Evaluation
The system of reporting traffic in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax surveillance, thus eliminating the transport of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid contrary to the legislation.
This can be recommended as good practice.

Due to the good practice in the Slovak Republic in the field of electronisation of tax returns, the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic recommend completing the electronisation of the processing of tax returns in the Czech Republic.
Analysis of changes in organisational structure and staffing in the field of excise duties
The organisational arrangements of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic have undergone fundamental changes.
Organizational arrangement of Customs Administration
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic since 1.1.2013 consists of the General Directorate of Customs and Customs Offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.
DG is the unit of account for the entire customs administration.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has performed comprehensive excise management since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.
The Czech Republic also carries out:
(a) control:
ശശ in the field of road transport (weighing of lorries, payment of road user charges, fulfilment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road haulage and in matters of international passenger transport),
ശശ waste and packaging material management,
ശശ safety of imported food,
ശശ in the areas of consumer protection and intellectual property
ശശ employing foreigners,
(b) customs administration - this is the comprehensive application of customs legislation, commercial policy measures and formalities for the import and export of goods,
(c) the collection and recovery of pecuniary obligations imposed by other public authorities in a divided administration;
(d) the activities of the police authority (authorised customs authorities) in proceedings concerning offences committed in breach of customs and related regulations and tax rules, where the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administration.
While the scope of the competences (concurrent control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there are economies of scale, as the public administration does not have to spend on the status of the control group for each subject of the control separately.
At the same time, there is a reduction of the administrative burden on the persons checked by the re-check.
10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has, since 1.12.2016, exercised the powers to verify compliance with the obligations to register sales (Article 2(2) of Law No 112/2016 Coll., on the Record of Sales) and, from 1.1.2017, the supervision of compliance with the law and the conditions of operation of games of chance, including the imposition of penalties (Article 116 of Law No 186/2016 Coll., on games of chance).
Under the project Modernization of Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed the three-tiered structure to two-tiered structure with effect from 1.1.2013, with the abolition of the middle article of management (customs directorates).
The DG spent around CZK 51 million on the project (i.e. around €2,031,000).
The Czech Republic's CS since 1.1.2013 has been made up of DGs and county customs offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.
Customs offices and their competences are determined by law, excise administration is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial offices.
Territorial workplaces are the internal organisational units of customs offices.
The Ministry of Finance is empowered by decree to establish and abolish territorial sites and to determine their material scope.
The legislation does not provide for any competences for the territorial workplace; the territorial workplace exercises the competencies of the customs office on its behalf.
Organisational structure until 31.12.2012
Organisational structure since 1.1.2013
Management of excise duties until 31.12.2012 was carried out by DGs, eight DCs and 58 CA units (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 unions and units.
As of 1.01.2016, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the DGs and 51 departments in the CA and its territorial offices, as well as by eight departments in the legal department of the DGs and the CA departments providing mobile supervision, i.e. about 60 posts.
The costs of the CS CR most significantly affect wage expenditure.
There were no savings in personnel resources as a result of the reorganization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
The performance of the main processes is ensured by customs officers in service under the Law on the Service of Security Forces.
The possibility of reducing the numbers of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, since under the provisions of Section 42(1) of Act No 361/2003 Coll., on the service of members of the security forces, they can only be dismissed from the service in cases that are exhaustively defined.
Reduction of service posts due to organisational changes in the security corps is not a reason for dismissal, and the employer is obliged to ensure that members are assigned adequate service posts within the corps, or to secure service posts with another security corps (e.g. the Police of the Czech Republic, the Prison Service of the Czech Republic), or else to transfer them to the reserve for the temporarily non-attached, in which the members of the security corps are entitled by law to 80% of the average service income.

Organizational arrangement of excise management in SR
As part of the Programme Declaration for 2012 to 2016, the Government of the Slovak Republic has set as one of its priorities the completion of the reform of the tax administration through the UNITAS programme, which will safeguard additional budgetary resources by aligning tax collection, duties and levies and curbing tax evasion.
In this context, tax reform was implemented at the central level, resulting in the merger of the Tax Directorate of the SR and the Customs Directorate of the SR into the Financial Directorate of the SR and the creation of a financial administration.
The PŘ SR was set up on 1.1.2012 by Act No 333/2011 of the State Administration on Taxation, Charges and Customs, as amended, as a budgetary organisation which has its headquarters in Banska Bystrica and is linked to the State budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
The FŘ SR, the CA and the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No 199/2004 Z. z., the Customs Act and amending and supplementing certain Acts, as amended, are customs authorities when they perform tasks under customs legislation.
Within the meaning of Act No 333/2011 of the State Administration in the field of Taxation, Charges and Customs, as amended, together with the Tax Offices, they form a financial administration.
The new organisational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, the Competence Centre of Financial Operations, the Tax Offices, the Tax Offices Branch, the Tax Offices Contact Points, the Customs Offices Branch (CA Tax Branch, CA Branch Combined, CA Branch) and Customs Offices Station.
The main mission of the FŘ SR is the effective collection and management of taxes and duties, i.e. including excise duties, to fulfil the revenue part of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.
The statutory body of the FŘ SR is the President of the Financial Administration, appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
The president of the financial administration is responsible to him for the activities of the entire financial administration and therefore for those of the FŘ SR, which he manages and represents in its entirety.
Organisational structure of the FŘ SR since 1.1.2012 in abbreviated form
Within all customs offices in the territory of SR, excise duties management activities and processes are carried out by excise duties departments (9 departments) and legal departments (9 departments), in addition to customs offices (38 branches) and customs offices (18 stations).

Comparison and Evaluation
Comparison
Within the organisational structure of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic, 74 organisational units, with a total of 1 300 employees, handled excise administration in 2015, in addition to the FŘ SR; almost 48,000 tax entities are managed by these departments.
Within the organisational structure In 2015, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic dealt with the management of excise duties by some 60 organisational units with a total of 1 011 employees, which manage some 114 000 tax entities.
In the Czech Republic, the performance of the various activities of excise administration is divided among several independent personnel services.
Their co-ordination and co-operation is addressed through middle and top management.
In the Slovak Republic, the performance of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax inspection) in the field of excise management is divided between the excise department and the customs office branch, within the framework of which the same employees of the tax administration often deal with the said agenda.
Evaluation
In the Slovak Republic, there is about a third of the number of tax entities on the total number of employees in the field of excise administration compared to the Czech Republic; the effect of a higher number of employees on the efficiency of excise administration is not clear.
EMCS
According to the preamble to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the movement and monitoring of excisable products, the objective of the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to make it possible to obtain real-time information on the movement of goods within the Community under suspension of excise duty, and to carry out the prescribed checks.
When introducing the system, Member States should have allowed economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to make use of these national elements at the lowest possible cost.
Article 3 of that EP and Council Decision allows the inclusion in the EMCS of national specifications, national databases forming part of the system and such technical or software as a Member State deems necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration.
EMCS in the Czech Republic
Development and functionality of EMCS
In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by a system of registration of selected products (EVV), which operated from May 2004 until the end of March 2010.
EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1.4.2010 and is continuously complemented by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).
A so-called Customs Module and Declarant Module have been introduced in the Czech Republic.
The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.
Beyond the Community scheme, in the Czech Republic, the EMCS system monitors shipments under the conditional exemption scheme both started and ended in the Czech Republic.
The system provides for the automatic upload of information to the Register of Tax Entities following the approval of the notice of receipt of the shipment intended for the authorised consignee for one-off receipt, with subsequent invalidation of the authorisation.
The system fully ensures the administration of both received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELOs, including sending replies with an attachment in any format and providing translations.
The report on manual export termination in ECS is also allowed to be accepted (only the referral of an automatically generated message is implemented in the EU).
Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.
The EMCS will not permit the approval of an e-AD or a notice of receipt without the response of the competent customs authority to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).
The Declarant module is available free of charge for tax entities, in the form of a web application to which the user logs in with the username and password(s) assigned to him after registration with the CS CR.
Each operation against an EMCS customs module shall be accompanied by a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.
The Declaration Module allows tax entities to directly record data on commenced and terminated shipments under a conditional exemption scheme, so that tax entities do not have to spend money to acquire the scheme.
The declarant module's national functionalities allow data to be retrieved and stored off-line (saving time on frequently used data), filling in recipient data based on the SEED ID check and requiring mandatory completion of data that is optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).
The system also allows for any consignment dispatched from the Czech Republic to be blocked in real time from securing an excise duty equivalent to the taxable transaction until the time the transport ends.
The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by the EMCS.
Without a sufficient amount of collateral, the EMCS declarant module is not allowed to send the draft e-AD for approval to CA of dispatch.
Each warranty has a unique number and contains the transport ARC (including the amount of the blocked collateral) for which it was used.
The tax entity can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it sees the current amount of the blocked and unblocked excise duty guarantee.
Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS
The development of the EMCS was realised on the basis of eight contracts with performance from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46,791,924.60 (or €1,761,412.56) excluding VAT.
In accordance with the contracts concluded, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of £43,577,255.19 (or €1,640,401.10) excluding VAT between 2006 and the end of 2015.
During the audited period, expenditure amounting to CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e. €547,438.99) was incurred for the EMCS upgrade.
The amount spent on EMCS upgrades during the audited period and converted to one transport entered into EMCS averages 16.49 CZK (or 0.62 €), excluding national transport, this expenditure in terms of one transport between the Czech Republic and EU Member States is 24.40 CZK (or 0.92 €).
The EMCS technical support was implemented on the basis of four performance contracts from 2011 to 2017.
By the end of 2015, a total amount of technical assistance of CZK 7,499,675 (or €281,389.77) including value added tax was invoiced.
The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 per transport contributed to the EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (or €0.23).
Both the development and technical support invoices related to the national solution and led to the development of the EVV application, which DG already operated before EMCS itself.
The invoices were paid in programme funding from national sources.
Technical support is invoiced as part of the supply of services as well as other applications provided by the supplier for Customs Administration of the CR.
EMCS v SR
The EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor movements of excise goods between Member States under a duty suspension arrangement.
It replaced the accompanying administrative document — SAD, which was used before the system was effective, thereby ensuring better control and management of traffic.
It has been in place in the SR since 1.4.2010 and has been continuously supplemented by requirements under EU legislation.
A unique reference code is generated for each transport, the so-called
An ARC code under which said traffic can be monitored online, i.e. in real time.
Development and functionality of EMCS
The EMCS only ensures the receipt and dispatch of excise goods by those taxable entities authorised to use the EMCS, thus largely reducing the risk of tax evasion.
The biggest development in functionalities came in 2011, when EMCS was fully operational (see Annex 6).
Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS
The introduction of the EMCS has been implemented as an additional module of the SysNeD application equipment and therefore it is not possible to accurately determine on the Slovak side the cost of its initial application.
Comparison and Evaluation
Comparison
The aim of EMCS was to replace a system based on the administration of paper-based transport.
The benefits of EMCS are a comprehensive overview of intra-EU transport between Member States from the announcement of the start of transport to its end, with significant reductions in administrative costs for tax administrations and tax entities to process, transmit and archive documents.
In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, a national functionality has been introduced into the EMCS system allowing monitoring of traffic in a conditional system between two locations in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic respectively.
In addition, automatic functionality of online monitoring and guarantee of excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.
A national functionality is also introduced to monitor the riskiness of the taxpayer or transport, followed by a mandatory response from the tax authorities.
SR and the Czech Republic record a comparable number of intra-EU traffic in the EMCS system.
However, spending in SR on upgrading this system was €744,310.01 higher than in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015.
The SAO SR only obtained the EMCS upgrade data from the FŘ SR for the period from 2011, although this system had been introduced and operated before.
Yet the expenditure incurred for the upgrade of the EMCS system in SR was €188,134.44 more than the expenditure for the introduction and upgrade of the EMCS system in about ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.
Evaluation
During the audited period, the volume of expenditure related to the upgrade of the EMCS system in SR in terms of one shipment is 2.3 times higher than expenditure of the same type in the Czech Republic.
Conclusion
The cooperation of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic met the objectives.
Both audit institutions have acquired a deeper knowledge of the excise management system in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
It was found that, despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences in the two tax systems which affect the efficiency of excise administration.
Parallel checks have identified examples of good practice that could contribute to curbing tax fraud, which will grow in importance as tax rates rise.
Procedures reducing the cost of excise administration have also been identified.
Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons if coordinated due diligence checks are not carried out at the tax administration.
In this, the role of the supreme audit institutions is irreplaceable.
Report on the results of the parallel review of the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction Word
The Lima Declaration of 1977 stresses that the supreme audit institutions (SAIs) have the power to audit all public financial operations.
The Declaration calls for tax revenues to be controlled to the fullest extent possible.
The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers tax as one of the most significant components of public revenue.
The VIth EUROSAI Congress, held in Bonn in 2005, dealt with SAI audits of public revenues.
A major step towards optimising SAI control activity is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is particularly relevant to taxes as the bulkiest source of public revenue, most vulnerable to large losses.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may to some extent be unable to carry out control activities without the cooperation of another State's SAI.
An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes substantial losses in revenue for many countries.
In order to combat this crime, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.
The SAIs that carry out inspections in this area must be willing to establish closer cooperation between themselves.
It was at the VIth EUROSAI Congress in Bonn that the idea arose of carrying out a review of the administration of value added tax (VAT) and the VIES system within the framework of cooperation between the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof.
Careful preparation ensued, with both parties first having to familiarise themselves with the legal environment and procedures for managing VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Analysis of this information led to a selection of control topics to be included in the control programme.
Achieving an efficient and efficient VAT administration has been a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify and make the collection of this tax more transparent.
We believe that the results of our scrutiny can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrations, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of parallel controls on the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Object of control:
(CZ) Value Added Tax Administration after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union
(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004
Target of control:
(CZ) The objective of the audit operation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the tax authorities in the administration of value added tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (EU) linked to the free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, in particular when checking the exercise of the right to value added tax exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the system for checking intra-Community value added tax, with a particular focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the aforementioned regulations.
The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.
The system of exchange of information on value added tax The auditing actions were carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as BRH) in mutual cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two auditing institutions on 8 June 2006.
Cooperation focused mainly on examining selected business transactions carried out between payers from the Czech Republic (the Czech Republic) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany), using information obtained through international cooperation between tax administrations and comparing the VAT administration systems of the two countries.
The joint final report on the results of the control actions was prepared in the sense of the European Directive No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1.5.2004 to 31.12.2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
The parallel control in the field of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and the German Republic was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAIs.
Beyond the main point - the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 - the control covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements, which are closely linked to the main point.
In addition, the control included the legal situation of international bus passenger services and a comparison of some statistical data.
Comparing the VAT management systems of the two countries revealed differences in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the primary criterion (among others) for registering is exceeding the limit laid down in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, payers are assigned only one tax identification number, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, taxpayers are given a tax number when registering for VAT, which only serves for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.
If a German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, it must request the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As different ways of registering cause problems, conditions should be levelled out across the EU (see 4.1).
2) International bus passenger transport.
In the Czech Republic, international bus transport of persons is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, the part of the transport that takes place on German territory is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT (see 4.2)
3) VAT returns.
While in the Czech Republic, taxpayers only submit VAT returns for individual tax years (month or quarter), in Germany, taxpayers are obliged to submit so-called preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and must submit annual VAT returns after the end of the calendar year.
Unlike CR payers, payers in Germany are required to submit preliminary tax returns electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary reports.
While in the Czech Republic, payers file summary reports at financial offices, in Germany, payers file summary reports at CLOs.
The tax authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have the data from the recapitulative statements immediately after they are filed.
The information from the recapitulative statements is only available to the German tax authorities once they have been processed into CLOs.
Combating VAT fraud requires updated information on intra-Community transactions to be available as soon as possible.
Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements would reduce the time lag between the transaction date and the update of the VIES data.
This in turn would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4).
Which would, but would require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for submitting a recapitulative statement.
(5) International VAT Information Exchange.
The Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for the information requests received.
The German CLO does not track the elapsed time.
As a result, the German tax authorities dealt with a significantly lower percentage of applications received within the time allowed.
Because of these problems, the BRH recommended that the German CLO carry out a permanent warning (see 4.6).
6) Risk management system.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS), which has its strengths and weaknesses.
The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in every EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
In the framework of cooperation, the two SAIs examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions, carried out between tax entities from the Czech Republic and the CFN.
Together, thirty-one cases of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution or suspicions of VAT evasion were examined using the CLO legislation.
It was found that:
In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained through international cooperation to calculate the taxpayer's VAT liability.
In those cases, the payers either improperly claimed exemption from VAT on the supply or failed to declare the acquisition of the goods on the VAT return.
In some cases, the financial authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used due to different legal provisions in both Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to a request for information.
Cases have been identified where payers have erroneously reported business transactions in summary reports.
As a result, the data in VIES was incorrect and the tax administrations had to examine these cases (see 6).
Control Action Progress
Conduct of the audit operation in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - the revenue division of the state budget and territorial departments of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, southern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.
The audited persons were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter ‘MF’) and 10 tax offices – the Financial Office in Humpolci, the Financial Office in Jihlava, the Financial Office in Kadani, the Financial Office in Liberec, the Financial Office in Nymburk, the Financial Office in Otrokovice, the Financial Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 4 the Financial Office in Sokolova and the Financial Office in Thirti.
The audit conclusion from this audit event was approved by the SAO College on 23 April 2007.
Conduct of the inspection operation in the SRN
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the Indirect Taxation Audit Group and the personnel of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
The inspection was part of the 2006 control plan and was therefore notified to the Federal Ministry in 2006.
After the testing phase, the review started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to cases selected by BRH and later selected SAIs, BRH had to notify a number of federal states of control.
In addition to the talks at the Federal MF and the CLO, the audit was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhine-Palatinate and Saxony.
The tax files of the following tax authorities were included:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FÚ pro corporations/juridical persons (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Alton, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Innschüd-centr (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-Hampümn-Stadt (Hamburg-Colomnover) and Hamburg for large enterprises (Hamburg-Midtown Hamburg)
In addition, discussions took place with the Augsburg-City Financial Authority (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-Old City (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
A report on the inspection findings was submitted to the I.F. in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two audit institutions
As part of the preparation of the parallel control actions, several meetings of representatives of the two control institutions took place in the period prior to their launch.
Participants in these meetings were acquainted with the organisation of tax administrations, the legislative treatment of VAT issues and the VAT administration system in both countries.
At the meeting, which took place in May 2006, the subjects of the test phase were agreed upon.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at another joint meeting in August 2006.
As part of this meeting, a timetable for further progress of work was agreed and the following themes of parallel controls were identified:
1. Registering taxpayers for VAT.
2.
International Bus Carriage of Persons - Legislative Adaptation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of tax administrations when handling requests for information and examining selected problem cases listed in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and the FRG.
4. Tax returns for VAT.
5.
Summary reports.
6.
Statistical data on the supply and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. VAT risk management.
At the joint audit day of the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, the two parties took note of the progress of the audit in the Czech Republic and the FRC and discussed the results of the parallel audits to date.
A report on the results of parallel controls on VAT administration between the Czech Republic and the FRG was prepared at a workshop in July 2007.
4. Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and Germany
Registration of payers in the Czech Republic
A) Payers who have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic
A taxpayer, under Act No 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees (hereinafter referred to as Act No 337/1992 Coll.), is a taxpayer, a taxpayer and the legal successor of a natural or legal person defined as a taxpayer by law.
As of 31 December 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.
On 1.12.2005 there was an increase in the number of taxable entities registered for VAT to 457 590.
A taxable person who has his registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) for the next 12 consecutive calendar months, becomes a taxable person from the 1st day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (Article 94(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; ("Law 235/2004 Coll.").
The person is required to submit an application for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he or she exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not allow a taxable person to be registered so-called retroactively in cases where the reason for registration is that the legal limit for registration has been exceeded.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable or VAT-exempt transactions with a right to deduct may become a taxable person, even if he does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575), if he fulfils any of the other conditions laid down in Act No 235/2004 Coll.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the conditions laid down by law can apply for VAT registration voluntarily.
The registration procedure under Act No 337/1992 Coll. is initiated by the delivery of the application for registration to the locally competent tax authorities.
A voluntary VAT payer shall also indicate on his VAT registration application the date on which he applies to register as a VAT payer.
The tax administrator shall examine the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed registration form with all annexes.
If it has doubts about the data, it shall invite the taxpayer to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.
Once the tax authorities have verified that the taxpayer meets the conditions for registration, they issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the taxpayer is registered and has been assigned a tax identification number (‘TIN’).
On the certificate, the tax authority shall indicate the effective date of registration for VAT and the periodicity of the tax year for VAT.
The tax period is the calendar quarter if the payer's turnover for the preceding calendar year has not reached CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).
If the payer's turnover for the preceding calendar year was CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the tax year is the calendar month.
A payer whose turnover for the previous calendar year was CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax year and shall notify the tax authority of the change.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The allocation of the TIN in the registration certificate is always constitutive and the taxpayer is obliged to indicate it in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax authority and in cases provided for by a specific law (e.g. Act No 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).
The TIN contains the code ‘CZ’ and the tribal part, which consists of the general identifier.
The general identifier for a natural person is the birth number or other general identifier, if provided for by a separate law, and for a legal person the identification number (provisions of Section 33(12) of Act No 337/1992 Coll.).
If the taxpayer has not complied with his registration requirement, even at the request of the tax authorities, the locally competent tax authorities shall register him of their own motion without delay.
The outcome of the registration procedure is the issue of the Ex officio Registration Certificate, which is delivered to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, a tax entity that has obtained a business license is assigned a TIN at the time of its first registration for any tax.
The same TIN is used by the tax entity even if it is registered as a VAT payer.
Pursuant to the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., which has been in force since 1.1.2005, in the event of failure to comply with the VAT registration obligation, the tax authorities may impose on the taxable person a refund of up to 10% of the aggregate income or income for taxable transactions which that person has wrongly carried out tax-free, for the period from the date on which he was legally required to be a registered payer until the date on which he became a registered payer by virtue of the tax authority's decision (Paragraph 98(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.).
The payment of the amount thus determined is considered to be a tax payment (Article 98(3) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.
The deregistration of the VAT payer, subject to the conditions laid down by law, is possible for two reasons:
1.
Withdrawal of registration at the request of the payer, mainly due to the amount of turnover below the registration limit (§ 106(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.).
The payer shall be entitled to apply for deregistration at the earliest after 1 year has elapsed from the effective date indicated on the registration certificate.
2. Withdrawal of registration ‘ex officio’ (Article 106(7) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.), if: (a) the payer has not carried out the transactions for 12 consecutive months without notification of the reason to the tax authorities, (b) the payer fails to fulfil his obligations under Act No 235/2004 Coll., (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.
(B) Payees who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State who does not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who makes a transaction with a place of supply in the Czech Republic and is liable to declare and pay tax on that transaction pursuant to Section 108 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. (the so-called “non-established payer”) shall become liable on the date on which that transaction takes place.
This person is required to submit an application for registration to the Tax Office for Prague 1 no later than the date on which the transaction takes place.
It is required to indicate in its registration application all TIN allocated to it in other Member States or in a third country.
If a ‘non-resident’ payer submits an application for registration later than the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic, the Tax Office for Prague 1 registers it retroactively because, under Act No 235/2004 Coll., the taxpayer became liable for VAT on the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic.
When registering retroactively, the Tax Office for Prague 1 requires proof from tax entities that the transaction has been performed (invoices and explanatory letters, as appropriate).
If the "non-resident" taxpayer applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable transaction takes place, then the Tax Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts that the transaction will take place.
There were 473 "non-resident" payers registered at the Tax Office for Prague 1 on 31.12.2004, out of which 124 payers from the SRN, and 951 "non-resident" payers registered at 31.12.2005, out of which 233 payers from the SRN.
Pursuant to Paragraph 106(9) of Law No 235/2004 Coll., the tax authority is entitled to cancel the registration of a ‘non-resident’ payer on 31 January of the following calendar year, if that payer has not incurred any obligation to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.
An audit by the SAO found that if a non-resident payer files a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the legal regulations at the deadline for filing a tax return, it is often not yet available to the tax office on 31 January.
In cases where the facts relevant to the possibility of de-registration are known to the Tax Office later than 31 January, it is no longer possible in the Czech Republic to de-register a non-established taxpayer for VAT in a given calendar year.
Registration of payers in the SRN
In view of the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (Sections 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter ‘AO’), anyone carrying on a business activity is required to inform the city/municipal authority or the competent tax authority.
The deadline for submitting information is one month after the start of business.
This information is processed by the City/Municipal Bureau for the Financial Conduct Authority.
If the Financial Conduct Authority identifies an enterprise that has commenced operations but has not registered, the Financial Conduct Authority may register that payer ex officio - and retroactively.
Taxpayers who are both resident and non-resident taxpayers in Germany are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria laid down in Paragraph 2 of the German VAT Law (UStG).
That obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover they realise.
There is no voluntary VAT registration in the SRN.
There are special finance offices for entrepreneurs permanently resident abroad.
For example, for those based in the Czech Republic, the competent Tax Office is Chemnitz-Süd.
As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office; A total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered as of 1 March 2006.
The BRH found that these special tax authorities often refused to register so-called semi-dependent independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.
As work permits for employees from the 10 new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers have sought to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.
Those undertakings do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs laid down in Paragraph 2 of the UStG because they are usually dependent on a single employer to determine their working hours and the way in which they carry out their work.
In order to be registered, an entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the relevant tax office, in which he must provide information about the company and the activities it carries out.
The questionnaire is a standard form which is binding on all tax authorities in Germany.
It is processed either by the special departments of the tax authorities or by general departments responsible for assessing taxpayers.
This form provides a risk assessment of each taxpayer before the IRS issues a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows certain rules:
The first three digits provide information on the relevant tax office, the following three (or four) provide information on the relevant department at the tax office, the next five (or four) are to distinguish payers, the last always being a check digit.
If a trader intends to engage in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive a tax-exempt intra-Community supply.
The CLO will assign a VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in the SRN and if he has a VAT number.
The CLO assigns VAT IDs to entrepreneurs automatically when payers include intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns.
Structure VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur may be revoked: 1. at the request of the entrepreneur (for example, if he has ceased his business activities), after all administrative work has been carried out (assessment for all business years), and 2. if the tax administration becomes aware that he is no longer engaged in business activities.
The validity of a VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of a VAT tax number.
In such cases, the tax authorities are required to inform the CLO of the cancellation of the tax number so that the CLO can terminate the VAT identification number.
Under the German VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), tax residents in Germany are not required to pay VAT in case 1. the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2. in the following year is unlikely to exceed EUR 50 000.
So-called small entrepreneurs (‘Kleinunternehmer’) are not entitled to invoice other entrepreneurs for VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
Although they are not liable to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and must submit an annual VAT return.
A small businessman may declare that he will not apply the provisions of Paragraph 19(1) of the UStG.
That return is binding on him for the next five years.
The trader can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.
There is an option for non-residents to appoint tax representatives (section 22a UStG).
It is a prerequisite that they carry out exclusively exempt commercial transactions and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
The function of a tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign businessman who thus does not have to register for VAT.
Information on representation for tax purposes must appear on invoices.
Comparison and Evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the primary criterion (among others) for registering is exceeding the limit laid down in the VAT Act.
If the taxpayer in the Czech Republic does not exceed the limit set, he has the option to apply for VAT registration voluntarily.
The registration process is standardized in the SRN, but differences may occur as a result of different organizational models in federal states.
In the Czech Republic, a payer is assigned a TIN at the time of his first registration for any tax.
If the payer registers for VAT, he also uses the same TIN in intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxpayer is given a tax number when registering for VAT, which only serves for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.
If a German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, it must request the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As the SAO and BRH have found, Germany's two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other member states, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration to intra-community transactions.
On the other hand, a two-tier system allows for retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax authority about their business.
This retroactive registration allows the correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax year, a particularly accurate estimate of VAT liability.
As different ways of registering cause problems, conditions should be levelled out across the EU.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (TIN).
The Federal Tax Office will allocate the TIN at the birth of a natural person.
This TIN will be valid for the lifetime of a natural person who is a German resident.
If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax authority will request an economic TIN to be used as a VAT ID.
In the future, there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the allocation of the VAT ID.
Work on implementing an IT resource to manage the TIN has not yet been completed.
International bus passenger services
Legislation in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., with effect from 1 May 2004, the carriage of persons between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct.
Such carriage is exempt from VAT even if it is carried out by traders who are registered for tax in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.
The return service is considered to be a separate service.
Unless ‘non-established’ tax entities in the Czech Republic carry out other economic activities in addition to international bus passenger transport, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.
The international carriage of persons was exempt from VAT in the Czech Republic on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V Cap. 5 paragraph 1 (b), which states:
‘For the purposes of Article 28(3)(a), the following definitions shall apply: The Czech Republic may continue to exempt international passenger transport under point 17 of Annex F to the Directive from value added tax until the condition set out in Article 28(4) of the Directive is met or the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier. "
Description of legislation in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in Section 3b(1) of the German VAT Act, the place of supply of passenger transport (i.e. transport services) is the route (i.e. the place) where the transport takes place.
The German tax system therefore makes no distinction between domestic and international cross-border passenger traffic.
Only that part of the route which takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable supply of transport in Germany.
The German tax system also makes no distinction between tax residents and non-residents.
If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through the SRN, the part of the route that takes place in the SRN also constitutes a taxable supply of transportation.
The non-resident taxpayer must notify the competent tax office of his intention to provide passenger transport before performing his services in Germany.
The tax office registers this non-taxable person (cf. 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach that is mentioned in the taxpayer's notice.
The taxpayer is required to declare his taxable supplies of transport on the German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, the Financial Conduct Authority of Chemnitz-Süd had registered 741 Czech payers who were engaged in passenger transport.
Where passenger transport is provided to a taxpayer liable for VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the tax office.
Instead, the entity liable to pay the VAT to the Tax Office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer is the resident taxpayer who is the recipient of the services; This process is known as reverse charge and complies with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
Apart from the notification of the non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return, the German tax authorities have several means of assessing the correctness of the taxable supplies of passenger transport declared.
The customs office's mobile control groups audit the certificates of buses licensed (licensed) for foreign transport that are used to carry passengers through the SRN.
After each audit, the mobile control groups send a check report to the competent tax office.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to claim VAT from the bus driver before continuing the onward journey.
A non-resident may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax calculated on his VAT return.
If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may announce its intention to carry out an audit, which must take place in the tax office, or it may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).
Even if a non-resident taxpayer refuses to pay the amount of VAT assessed in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may request administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
If there is to be a review of the VAT return or of the non-resident taxpayer's obligations, BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too labour intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable supplies of passenger transport.
In particular, auditing the accounts of a non-resident taxpayer incurs disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.
The tax administration has to audit foreign accounting, which means not only a need for knowledge of a foreign language, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.
An audit of this type is also likely to require more time than a tax resident's audit, but this is limited to the provision of passenger transport that takes place in Germany.
On the other hand, a non-resident taxpayer may not only accept the right to carry out a check, which is a matter for his national tax administration, but also the right to be audited by other Member States in which he is carrying passengers.
Moreover, in any Member State in which only one supply of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all the tax obligations imposed on him in those Member States, in all the languages and on all the tax forms of those Member States.
The actual taxation of cross-border passenger traffic therefore generates disproportionate bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and Evaluation
The legal situation in the two countries is different.
In the Czech Republic, the carriage of persons between individual EU Member States or between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT with a right to deduct tax under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the part of the transport that takes place on German territory constitutes a taxable transaction.
When such carriage is first provided in Germany by a non-resident payer, he or she is required to give advance notice of the provision of carriage to the relevant tax office.
The tax office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to declare taxable supplies of part of the carriage on the tax return in Germany.
Implementation of the law is very time-consuming in Germany.
At least three of the four Czech payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office are in the passenger transport business.
Compared to the effort, the tax take, when realized, is rather low.
Member States collecting VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT are burdened with time-consuming obligations without a financially sensitive outcome.
In order to avoid disproportionate costs for charging VAT, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in only one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the provider is based.
Such taxation would require modification of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
Tax returns for VAT
Submission and processing of VAT tax returns in the Czech Republic
The payer is required to submit a VAT return on a form prescribed by the GIF within 25 days of the end of the tax year, even if he has not become liable for tax, unless the law provides otherwise.
The actual tax liability is due by the deadline for filing the VAT return, with the exception of the tax charged in connection with the importation of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., in respect of which the tax liability is determined by the customs legislation.
If a refundable excess arises as a result of the excess deduction being assessed, the payer shall be refunded without request within 30 days of the excess deduction being assessed.
The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax administration initiates a tax procedure concerning the payer's tax liability.
In accordance with Paragraph 73(11) of Law No 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct may be exercised on the regular VAT return at the latest for the last tax year in which the right to deduct could be exercised.
At the end of that period, the right to deduct may be further exercised within three years of the end of the tax year in which the right to deduct may have been exercised at the earliest.
However, this is only possible by filing an additional VAT return.
The amendment to Act No 235/2004 Coll., in force since 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct could be exercised for the first time.
The payer is required to submit a supplementary VAT return if (a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, (b) he makes a correction which does not alter the last known tax liability but only the data previously claimed by the taxpayer, (c) he makes a correction to the rate and amount of tax pursuant to Article 49 of Law No 235/2004 Coll.
The payer may submit an additional VAT return if the total of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer is required to submit an additional VAT return by the end of the month following the discovery.
Electronic VAT returns can be submitted either via the Internet or on a technical data medium.
Internet submissions can be made as submissions with a data message bearing an advanced electronic signature or as submissions with a data message not accompanied by an advanced electronic signature.
In the case of filing with a data message not accompanied by an advanced electronic signature, filing in writing, i.e. delivery of a computer report to the tax authority (e-form), is still required.
The VAT return contains separate lines relating to intra-Community delivery/acquisition values.
Service acquisition values are reported on separate lines of the VAT return.
Some of the lines are used for the purpose of the initial automated check within the ADIS system.
The values of supplies of goods to other Member States to taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with the data provided in the summary reports filed by Czech payers.
Values of acquisitions of goods from other Member States from taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with those obtained through VIES from the recapitulative statements of payers from other EU Member States.
The IRS is running a credibility test on VAT returns under the ADIS system.
This test is automatic, as without the test, VAT returns cannot be assessed.
The credibility test involves calculating credibility criteria and evaluating risky types of VAT returns.
Pursuant to Article 37(1) of Law No 337/1992 Coll., the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who fails to comply within the prescribed period with a non-pecuniary obligation arising under this or a special tax law or imposed by a decision under this law.
An automated tax information system used by the FCA to provide technical support for tax administration.
The audit of the SAO found that the tax authorities did not make use of the possibility to impose a fine on taxpayers for not submitting a VAT return.
Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are required to submit provisional VAT returns still have to submit an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not liable for VAT have to submit an annual tax return.
As a general rule, taxpayers are required to submit their quarterly VAT return by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which the VAT is incurred (Paragraph 18(2) of the UStG).
However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6 136 in the preceding calendar year, or if the business is newly created, the trader concerned is required to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day of the following month.
A taxpayer may also choose to submit a monthly VAT return if a refund has been made in the past year which has exceeded EUR 6 136 (Paragraph 18(2a) of the UStG).
VAT returns need not be made if the amount of annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.
The relevant VAT liability amount must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax year in which the VAT was incurred.
The tax refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FCA.
There are no deadlines (by law) for processing tax returns and refunding excess VAT.
In order to have the tax refunded in good time, it may be offered to secure the amount to be refunded.
The basic principle is to process VAT returns and refund the tax quickly.
German VAT law provides for the possibility of extending that period (Paragraph 18(6) of the UStG).
Such an extension must be requested separately.
It allows a VAT return to be submitted and the relevant VAT tax liability to be paid a month later, provided that a special advance is paid on the monthly return.
This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT liability.
Whenever an error is detected, the trader must submit a corrective VAT return.
There is no additional VAT return.
Once the annual VAT return, which must be filed by 31 May of the following calendar year, is registered with the tax office, the trader cannot correct the erroneous preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT return.
A correction of the annual VAT return to or from the payer is possible during the next 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.
After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally only be corrected in cases of tax fraud or evasion.
Payees are required to submit their provisional VAT returns electronically.
The tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule to avoid undue hardship.
Submission of the annual VAT return is possible on paper or via the Internet, with or without certification.
If it is made without certification, payers must submit the return once more on paper with their personal signatures.
If the payer fails to submit a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.
In the case of late filing, a penalty payment can be imposed on the payer (up to a maximum of 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000).
BRH found during a previous inspection that the IRS often failed to measure this standard fine.
In other cases where the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The standard penalty therefore fails to meet its objective of reducing the average delay, particularly when filing an annual VAT return.
The VAT return contains separate lines relating to the values of intra-Community supplies/acquisitions of goods.
Service acquisition values are reported on separate lines of the VAT return.
Non-taxable transactions must be reported on a separate tax return/VAT line.
In the case of VAT returns presented in paper form, a copy must be made either through a scanner or by the staff specifically authorised to do so.
Data from VAT returns submitted electronically are immediately available to the Financial Conduct Authority.
Once all the data has been entered into the system, RMS staff will go through it and make a selection of cases that meet certain criteria.
Selected VAT returns must be checked by an IRS official on the basis of a control report prepared by the system.
(see section 5.2).
Although the tax administration has to make a rough estimate of the amount of VAT a taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and Evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers submit their VAT returns within 25 days of the end of the tax year.
The tax year is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month, depending on the amount of the payer's turnover.
In Germany, taxpayers file provisional VAT returns, depending on tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days of the end of the calendar quarter or month.
Payers are required to file an annual tax return by May 31 of the following year.
There are pros and cons to filing an annual VAT return:
+ on the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly provisional) tax returns by submitting a single annual VAT return;
– if the payer corrects the admitted intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be related to the period covered by the recapitulative statement;
– Federal states generally do not compare VIES data on intra-Community acquisitions of German payers before processing the annual VAT return.
In accordance with registration (see 4.1.3), German taxpayers are required to submit an annual VAT return, irrespective of the amount of their turnover.
This obligation allows the German tax authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small businesses.
In addition, the Tax Office responsible is able to compare annual VAT returns with direct tax returns and with final accounts.
In the Czech Republic, tax authorities are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only from filed income tax returns.
Unlike the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany are required to submit VAT returns electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to improving the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary reports
Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic
The summary report (hereinafter referred to as ‘SH’) is filed under the provisions of Article 102 of Law No 235/2004 Coll. by a payer who has made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State.
The data on the value of the goods supplied are always given in Czech currency, broken down by individual tax entities, with their VAT IDs, under which they are registered in their country.
Data on services rendered are not included in the SH.
SH shall be filed by payers with both monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days of the end of the quarter with the Tax Office, which shall have local jurisdiction.
The correction of erroneous data shall be made in the subsequent SH within 15 days of the date of detection of the errors.
Incorrect data in the SH is always replaced by data in the subsequent SH.
Like tax returns, payers can submit the BI in electronic form.
In the event that the payer does not file SH or the subsequent SH and should have filed it pursuant to Act No 235/2004 Coll., the tax authority shall invite him to file it, while informing him of the consequences in the event of failure to file SH or the subsequent SH, namely that the tax authority is entitled under Section 37 of Act No 337/1992 Coll. to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 000 000 (EUR 67 150) for non-monetary infringements.
The audit of the SAO found that the tax authorities did not make use of the possibility to impose a fine on payers for failing to comply with their legal obligations.
In particular, in the case of the filing of the SH, the tax entities are not sufficiently incentivised to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to file the SH does not affect the VAT liability.
The tax administrator is obliged under Section 102(5) of Act No 235/2004 Coll. to check the data in the SH, where appropriate in the subsequent SH, to remove any ambiguities and to use the data for determining the tax liability.
In the event of inconsistencies between the data in the SH and the data in the relevant (payer with a monthly tax year) or relevant (payer with a quarterly tax year) VAT return, the tax authority should verify the accuracy of the declared tax liability as stated in the VAT return.
The tax entity removes erroneous data in the SH by filing a subsequent SH itself, or may be required to do so.
The tax administrator shall correct the details of the supply of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:
– the payer fails to demonstrate the data in the SH (or subsequent SH), correcting it by submitting a subsequent SH,
– the tax authority has demonstrated that the information provided by the payer in the SH or subsequent SH is not true.
The tax administrator does not substitute the taxpayer's submission by inserting a correction without the submission of a subsequent SH, but merely modifies the information in the VIES database so that it is up to date, complete and accurate.
Data from the SH shall be sent to the relevant Member States.
They can only be sent and received by the national financial administration authority, designated to cooperate with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Ministry, the International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (CLO).
O_MCTL is an automated message that the CLO receives from other Member States.
Contains all the bad VAT IDs listed in SH's sent lines.
If a bad VAT ID is used in one of the transmitted normal SH or subsequent SH lines, it is recorded in the table of the bad VAT IDs.
The table includes a so-called "Notice of Doubt to VAT ID."
The tax administrator checks the data and records the result of the verification in the system.
When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is required to declare VAT and enter the acquisition values on separate lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of irregularities in the value of purchased goods declared by a Czech payer on his VAT return and in the value of the goods supplied, as reported by payers from other Member States in their SHs, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for examination.
Tax authorities have a duty to investigate irregularities.
Three situations can arise:
(a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant VAT return lines is lower than the value of the supply declared by the EU payers.
In this case, the tax authorities will check the accuracy of the data.
(b) The difference is 0.
This situation can occur either by changing the EU data (the foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer will itself submit an additional VAT return in the meantime).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administration to verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return despite this.
(c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States stated by the Czech taxpayer in the relevant lines of the VAT return is higher than the value of the goods supplied declared by the EU taxpayer.
Here again, it is at the discretion of the controller to verify the accuracy of the data.
After examining the discrepancy and explaining the causes of its occurrence, the tax authority shall provide the result of the verification to ADIS.
The results of the screening are relayed back to the CLO.
Figure 1 (NB: MF) shows the number of cases sent from the CLO to the tax authorities for examination for each quarter of 2005.
Chart 1 above shows that the number of cases transmitted from the CLO to the tax authorities was decreasing for the quarters of 2005.
A significant decrease in numbers occurred in Q4 2005. The CLO has raised the minimum financial limit, including with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.
The discrepancy between VAT return data and EU data does not always have to be due to an error on the part of the domestic payer.
It may also be an error on the part of the EU payers, or one resulting from the fact that in individual EU Member States certain types of transactions may be introduced into the SH in a different way.
The most common reasons for irregularities in the value of reported transactions found at audited financial offices are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the SRN
Entrepreneurs who carry out intra-Community deliveries from the SRN to other EU Member States or engage in triangular transactions are required to submit an SH once every quarter specifying intra-Community deliveries by beneficiary (§ 18a(1) UStG).
SH must be administered by the 10th day of the month following the corresponding calendar quarter.
If an extension of this time limit is allowed in the case of provisional VAT returns, this also applies to the SH.
SH must be supplied by CLO.
They must be submitted electronically from 1 January 2007.
Exemptions may be allowed by the relevant tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.
In cases where taxpayers realise that erroneous data are given in the SH, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.
In the event that the taxpayers do not file with the SH, the CLO will initiate proceedings to compel the submission of this report.
This procedure includes: – a first reminder – a second reminder linked to the threat of a fine/penalty payment, and – an assessment of the penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps, amounting to EUR 125, 250 and 500.
In addition, Paragraph 26a(1) No 5 of the UStG provides that payers are to act unlawfully if, intentionally or negligently, they fail to submit them properly to the SH, file them incomplete, fail to file them on time or, if they fail to repair or repair the SH late at all.
This offence can be punished with a fine of up to EUR 5 000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office as the processing of SHs is the sole task of CLOs.
SH data is stored only in the CLO system.
The data from the SH are therefore only visually available to the Financial Conduct Authority after processing into CLO.
The deadlines for processing the SH are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Data from SH must be stored during the three months following the relevant calendar quarter.
If incorrect VAT IDs are provided in the SH of German payers, the CLO will receive O_MCTL codes from another Member State.
The CLO contacts a particular entrepreneur and asks them for the correct data.
If CLOs fail to obtain correct information, the case is referred to the relevant tax authorities.
It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct data.
BRH found during the check that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID at CLO's request.
However, the challenge, the threat and the assessment of three additional fines take up too much time in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
These cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within a month or two.
The IRS rejected exemptions for reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases.
When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the Financial Conduct Authority asked him to submit a corrected SH to the CLO, as the Financial Conduct Authority could not correct the VIES data on its own.
BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor the CLO checked the submission of the corrected SH, so payers often did not comply with the request.
In view of the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data, the comparison of the data on the supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in the SH will not take place before the submission of those data to the CLO of other Member States.
This control can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually used in the preparation of a VAT control.
Data obtained from other Member States are processed into CLOs.
Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and then presented to the relevant Member States.
This data is used for the purpose of checking acquisitions by the tax authorities.
Once entered into the system, the CLO rechecks them based on a comparison with data from previous calendar quarters.
Where they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), audit information is generated and sent to the relevant tax authorities.
This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is produced later and submitted to the tax authorities.
The RMS installed for the assessment process will then cross-check these data with intra-Community acquisition data.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.
Comparison and Evaluation
In the Czech Republic, payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State shall submit the SH within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter to the Tax Office, which has local jurisdiction.
The tax authorities process the SH and transfer the data to the CLO.
The values of the supply of goods to another Member State, declared by the payers in the SH, are compared at the tax offices with the values of the supply of goods to another Member State indicated by those payers in the VAT returns.
The results of the comparison are used within the assessment procedure.
In SRN, payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to submit quarterly SH by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.
SH payers have been filing CLOs, since 1.1.2007, in electronic form.
The tax authorities only have the information from SH after processing it into CLO.
Both CR and SRN payers report only the supply of goods in the SH, the supply of services is not mentioned in the SH.
Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are unable to correct erroneous lines filed by SH on their own.
As a result of this limited access to German VIES data, the erroneous VAT IDs were not corrected, even if the payer provided the correct VAT ID to the FC.
The German tax administration does not compare the figures for intra-Community supplies given in the German taxpayer's VAT return and his SH.
Differences between the data of the two statements are usually not detected before the German CLO provides data from VIES to other Member States.
Given the BRH findings, it is clear that a comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in VIES.
Data on supplies of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on acquisitions of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their VAT returns.
Comparison is conducted by CLO separately for each calendar quarter.
The most significant cases of irregularities are referred to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in taxpayers' tax returns.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general check is processed only for payers who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax authority controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other payers only if the RMS produces a control notice or if the payer is destined for control anyway.
This approach relieves the tax authorities of the need to clarify the reasons for any difference.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
Tackling carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intra-Community acquisitions as soon as possible.
The current SH system, specifically VIES, provides financial authorities with information that can be up to six months old.
This delay can be reduced by up to four months if payers administer the SH on a monthly basis.
Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, since most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to file VAT returns on a monthly basis – and the SH does not require any additional information as opposed to a tax return.
To avoid bureaucratic costs, filing a SH may involve filing a VAT return.
However, an obligation to administer SH on a monthly basis would cause more time mismatches between the reporting of intra-community delivery and intra-community procurement and could increase the flow of data between CLOs.
The German federal government considered a general provision of monthly SHs in 2006.
Its implementation failed because of federal doubts.
These were concerned that the monthly submission of data from VIES to other Member States' CLOs could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact, if the monthly SH submission and monthly data transmission obligations were to be effective, a monthly update of VIES would require a European monthly SH standard.
Statistical data on delivery and acquisition of goods between Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, the CFN represents the Czech Republic's most important trading partner.
The total volumes of intra-Community transactions in goods made between the CR and the SRN are shown in Table 2.
Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous TIN or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL messages transmitted between the CR and the SRN for each quarter of the audited period.
These figures are set out in the following tables.
The data show substantial differences.
These differences may be due to different bases for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLOs relate their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was filed, the German CLOs relate their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
Level 3 international information exchange
Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic
International exchange of information allows tax administrations to obtain information from other Member States regarding intra-Community trade transactions and the payers who have carried out those transactions.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92, distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, namely the exchange of information on request and the exchange of information without prior request.
The international exchange of information upon request shall take the form of so-called requests for information (RFIs), using the standardised SCAC forms.
Tax Administrators from the Czech Republic send their ZhOI or replies to received ZhOI through the financial directorates at the CLO, which provides for the translation of the information provided on the SCAC standardised forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.
The CLO also provides for the receipt of the YEI from other Member States and replies to the transmitted YEI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the locally competent tax authorities for processing.
Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets the maximum time limit for processing an RFID at 3 months from receipt of the application.
The SAO audits were carried out on all YES, transmitted during the audited period between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Of the 94 YEARS recruited in the Czech Republic from the SRN, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month deadline, a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this deadline, and the remaining 1 were not sent to the SRN by the time of the SAO audit.
Figure 2 provides more detailed information on the deadlines by which replies to the RU received from the SRN were sent from the Czech Republic.
Of the 335 YEARS sent from the Czech Republic to the German Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) were answered within the three-month deadline, another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were answered after this deadline and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) were not answered by the time of the SAO audit by the SRN (in the remaining 1 cases, it was not possible to determine when the SRN response was received from the transmitted data).
Figure 3 provides more detailed information on the deadlines by which the replies to YES sent to the SRN were received in the Czech Republic.
The percentage expression of the intra-Community transaction values reported in the GI transmitted between the CR and the SRN is included in Chart 4.
As can be seen from the chart above, the value of commercial transactions, examined through the RBI, was most often in the range above EUR 60 000.
International exchange of information without prior request takes the form of either an automatic or structured automatic exchange of information or a spontaneous exchange of information.
Tax authorities from other Member States are often provided without prior request with information that may be relevant to them in administering VAT.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at CLO.
The information shall be transmitted electronically between Member States.
‘Automatic exchange’, according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and at predetermined regular intervals.
"Structured automatic exchange" then means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as the information is available.
The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information about the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.
This information is available to the tax authorities from the Report form for the delivery of the new means of transport pursuant to Section 19 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the tax document issued.
When processing the aforementioned form, the tax administrator shall fill in the necessary data in a specially created template and forward it in turn to the liaison officer at the Financial Directorate where the data are collected and transmitted to the CLO for subsequent processing and transfer to other Member States within a specified time frame, i.e. not later than two months after the end of the quarter in which the information was available.
Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on mail order sales exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU transactions that appear to be unauthorised and information on potential missing traders.
That information shall be sent to other Member States by spontaneous exchange using an SCAC form.
Conduct of international information exchange in Germany
In the SRN, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the local tax office.
The tax authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form by email directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
Financial authorities have been instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.
Half of the German requests for information audited by BRH were sent in order to ensure taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in another Member State, or to prove the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall check the value of the supply of goods or services referred to in the request for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.
If there is no reasonable basis for such a request, the German CLO will reject any request containing an amount lower than that fixed limit.
In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are not in German or English.
To answer a request for information, the CLO sends the request to the relevant IRS, pointing to a three-month deadline.
There are no further deadlines for processing requests at specific organisational levels of the tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor past deadlines, it lacks sufficient staffing capacity to alert the tax authorities to the response to blank requests for information.
The tax authorities will obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or conducting an audit.
Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit covering any taxable process over a period of several months, or a so-called VAT inspection, which can only cover one transaction that has been carried out recently.
This short and ﬂexible type of audit does not require any notification to the taxpayer and has proven its utility in investigating individual taxable transactions.
Under the automatic exchange without prior request, the SRN provides other Member States with information – on VAT IDs allocated to payers resident in other Member States, – on the refund of input tax to payers resident in other Member States.
In addition, the SRN committed to provide other Member States with the following information through structured automatic exchange:
a. Supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without the use of their VAT ID; b. shipping or catalogue sales in other Member States not taxable in the SRN; c. significant differences between intra-Community acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States; d. intra-Community supply of goods not declared by the German payer in the SH because the supplies were treated as domestic transactions; e. potential "missing trader" who carried out their intra-Community transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID; f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential "missing traders" or to those VAT recipients.
Comparison and Evaluation
In both the CR and the SRN, local tax authorities initiate the submission of YEI or spontaneous information and send the completed SCAC form to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses the bilingual SCAC form (Czech-English) and translates the information sent into English and German respectively, the German tax authorities follow the instruction that they should write ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German on the monolingual form.
The German CLO does not provide translation of German texts.
Examination of the RUs transmitted between 1.5.2004 and 31.12.2005 between the CR and the SRN found that the Czech tax administration had completed 74.5% of the applications received within the three-month time limit, while the RUs sent to the SRN were only processed by the German tax administration in 40.6% of the cases.
Although the German CLO alerts the tax authorities to the three-month deadline, it does not monitor the elapsed time limits.
The result of missing notifications is a large number of late replies to YES.
Because of these problems, the BRH recommended a regular alert to CLOs.
The situation has already improved.
According to the latest information, the German CLO is now alerting the tax authorities to answer unfinished answers to the Yi.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several departments at different organisational levels of the tax administration deal with VAT risk management.
Within the IFI, the following services deal with risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
VAT Methodology and Performance Unit and a report within it VAT risk management, which, among other things, manages the risk selection of possible tax evasion and assesses trends of such risks at both national and Community levels.
Coordinates the operation of the job nationwide The credibility of VAT tax returns and the use of VIES data in terms of the risks of tax evasion in intra-Community transactions.
Based on trade balance data, the Czech Republic evaluates risky commodities, processes conceptually the management of VAT risks and cooperates with relevant EU institutions and other Member States in this field.
The International VAT Management Cooperation Unit, which inter alia ensures the exchange of VAT information, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses VIES data from other Member States, ensures public awareness and provides other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous TIN or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL messages transmitted between the CR and the SRN for each quarter of the audited period.
These figures are set out in the following tables.
The data show substantial differences.
These differences may be due to different bases for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLOs relate their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was filed, the German CLOs relate their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
Unit Tax Control and Search Methodologies, which inter alia performs risk analysis in the methodological management of tax controls and, in line with risk analysis, sets priorities for targeting tax controls in the plans of the Financial Directorates, processes risk analyses in the context of tax evasion reduction, including the collection of lessons learned from tax administration as well as from other sources, and proposes measures to curb tax evasion.
Search departments are set up in the finance directorates to carry out, inter alia, searches of tax entities and areas at risk of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceuticals), searches of unregistered tax entities in terms of the risks of tax evasion (e.g. internet services, job placement, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of the links of chain fraud and transmission of information to territorial financial authorities.
Specialised control units are set up at the selected 12 financial offices.
They have regional competence, tax controls outside the territorial competence of the tax authorities are carried out by delegation.
The need to set up a specialist tax inspection unit has arisen from the mounting findings of new and improved forms of tax evasion, which are mainly found in entities linked to the chains.
These departments focus on controlling tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities, and multinationals and tax entities with a large scale of activity in terms of turnover.
The following mechanisms have been integrated into the ADIS system to limit VAT risks: – the role of the Trustworthiness of VAT returns, used to assess the riskiness of tax returns filed, – the role of the Selection of Tax Entities to Control, enabling the collection of taxpayer checks on the basis of the chosen criteria, – the role of the VIES, through which tax authorities have access to data provided from other EU Member States.
The VIES role allows, among other things: – to check the validity of VAT IDs of payers from other Member States, – to obtain from other Member States the values of goods delivered to the Czech payer, declared in the SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, – to generate a report of payers who have not filed the SH, – to carry out a formal check of the data supplied by the CR payers in the SH before sending those data to other Member States, – to generate a report of payers where the data on the supply of goods to other Member States stated in the VAT returns do not tally with the VAT returns of Member States.
As part of their activity to reduce the risks of tax evasion, tax authorities have access to registers of government departments such as the Commercial Register, Land Register, Motor Vehicle Register, Business Register, etc.
For more detailed information, see Chapter 4.4.1 Reporting and Processing of Summary Reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in the SRN
Due to the federal (federal) structure of the SRN, the federal tax administration (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of 16 federal states are involved in the development and operation of the RMS.
Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the federal tax administrations share a fully consistent database.
At the CLO level, ST I 2 (‘KUSS’) collects audit findings on tax fraud in a special database called the OPUS.
KUSS, in cooperation with the tax authorities, has set up a new database called ZAUBER designed to transmit the names of companies of tax fraudsters as "missing traders."
KUSS coordinates related cases of domestic and cross-border tax fraud.
The experience of KUSS is reflected in the development of RMS in working groups.
In addition, the specialists of several other CLO and MF departments are entrusted with RMS-related duties and powers.
A formal check on the composition of other Member States' VAT IDs in the SH filed by German payers is introduced at CLO level.
This formal check is carried out before the SH data are provided to other Member States, to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).
Validation of the VAT IDs in the SH is done on the basis of O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the process of correcting invalid VAT ID, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS on the CLO is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and produces several types of control reports based on several characteristics that typically feature in so-called carousel trading operations to identify potential missing traders.
The federal tax authorities are instructed to process these inspection reports and, in some cases, report on the results of their findings to the CLO.
The findings of the BRH audit confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all available characteristics if the existence of a tax fraud case (instead of an exclusive focus on the company's turnover) is to be presumed with sufficient probability.
BRH therefore proposed that MF take into account different characteristics when processing the reports.
The RMS should also sanction other facts, such as a taxpayer's payment behaviour (morality), industry (economic activity) or shareholder structure.
The second level of the RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the federal states and focused on the processing of VAT tax returns.
RMS, for example, generates a list of those payers who have reported intra-Community delivery in their tax returns.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the full submission of the SH.
In addition, this type of RMS compares intra-Community acquisitions, reported in the payer's annual VAT return, with VIES data.
The tax administrations of the federal states try to avoid comparing quarterly data because such comparisons would reveal too much disapproving data attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
- different execution times for an intra-community transaction in the view of the supplier on the one hand and the recipient on the other;
– Different accounting for sales discounts and sales events (incentives) and their different presentation on the tax return.
In addition to comparing data from VAT returns and VIES, many federal states have introduced elements of RMS that are based on VAT return data and some other facts (such as company name structure, shareholder age, number of employees and payment behaviour/taxpayer morality).
Bavaria has introduced RMS based on rules that allow a team of tax fraud specialists (risk managers) to program their own rules for singling out potential tax fraud perpetrators.
This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT return.
Accordingly, the competent tax authority will receive a recommendation made by the RMS before setting VAT.
Because this RMS is not able to reflect current findings in its operations, risk managers have to adjust the relevant rules based on financial authority feedback.
The Mecklenburg-West Pomerania administrative district programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with tax file data in which a check revealed tax evasion.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to identify the characteristics of the tax evasion.
The RMS produces a monthly list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.
The relevant tax authorities use this list as a basis for decisions on auditing proposed taxpayers.
Following the audit, auditors must report their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.
The North Rhine-Westphalia administrative district uses an adaptive artificial neural network that is combined with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on the large number of data of VAT returns under consideration and some other facts, this neuron-fuzzy system or data-mining system calculates the likelihood that a particular taxpayer has committed tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of potential fraud offenders.
The local tax authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers to check and report the findings of the check to the data processing centre.
The roll-out of one of the three RMS in the other Länder is ongoing.
As none of the three RMS is based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful to tackle tax fraud.
It remains to be seen whether this system will lead to the expected results.
Comparison and Evaluation
Although the specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three federal states of the SRN, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.
New trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud are currently being discussed by the tax authorities of EU Member States.
VAT fraud - particularly carousel fraud - is proving not to be a national problem, but rather a European one.
Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State, but in multiple states.
An effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in every EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.
A VAT loss caused by EU fraud may not hit the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.
Any Member State that is involved in fraudulent activities can be affected.
There should therefore be a European exchange and discussion of the RMS.
Selected control findings when verifying business transactions
In the framework of cooperation on the implementation of parallel control actions, the SAO and BRH examined the quality and use of information on selected business transactions, which were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the CR and the FRG.
In addition, the two control institutions jointly examined the execution of several commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution or inconsistencies in the way in which the payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions on their VAT and VAT returns respectively.
The SAO examined a total of 8 cases involving business transactions between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities at the request of BRH.
In 43 cases, the SAO checked the values of intra-Community transactions with the SRN reported by Czech payers in their tax returns and SH, based on the BRH warning.
BRH examined a total of 23 cases at the SAO's request, relating to business transactions carried out between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through official communication with the CLO.
Examination of the selected cases found, among other things, that a different way of registering in the EU Member States leads to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to data in VIES, the Czech payer should have purchased EUR 60 500 worth of goods from the German payer in the third quarter of 2004.
Since the Czech taxpayer declared the acquisition of goods only worth the equivalent of EUR 29 869, the Czech tax authorities sent a request to Germany to verify the value of the goods supplied.
In a reply to the RU received from the SRN, the German side stated that in Q2 2004 a German payer delivered goods worth EUR 27 381 to a Czech payer, EUR 31 997 in Q3 and EUR 10 276 in Q4 2004.
The reply further showed that the VAT ID of the German payer had only been valid since 28.9.2004, but the German CLO retroactively issued a VAT ID certificate of validity from 1.5.2004 in 2006 following an additional request from the German payer for a VAT ID certificate of validity.
The German payer made a correction to the SH.
The Czech payer, on the basis of this information, was the acquirer of the goods.
The SAO's enquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic revealed that the Czech taxpayer had submitted additional VAT returns for the various tax years of 2004, in which he had increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States while claiming the right to deduct VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.
However, it was not possible for the Czech tax authorities to determine unequivocally from these additional VAT returns whether the values of supplies from the German supplier mentioned above were also included.
BRH discovered, as requested by the SAO, that a German supplier had been registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, since he did not request a VAT ID when registering, he was only assigned an identification number for transactions within the SRN.
Although it is not usually possible in Germany to assign a VAT ID to a payer retroactively, in this case a German tax official in 2006 assigned a VAT ID to the German payer referred to above retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO assigns a VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay was caused by a CLO after the payer's request for a VAT ID.
In this case, CLO allocates VAT IDs retroactively because the trader does not need his own valid VAT ID for intra-Community supplies under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.
Conversely, the German beneficiary does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier in order to report intra-Community acquisitions.
Because of these different procedures between the Member States, the German CLO assigned VAT IDs retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax authorities asked for the registration of a German taxpayer for VAT to be verified.
The VIES indicated the date of registration as 5.3.2005, with the date of 1.10.2004 on the registration certificate for the German payer issued by the competent German tax office.
In a reply received from the SRN, the German side stated that the German tax entity had been registered since 1.10.2004, but the VAT ID was not provided to it in the SRN for organisational reasons until 16.2.2005.
The SAO's inquiry with the local tax administration found that the Czech tax administration had carried out a VAT check on the Czech taxpayer for the tax period from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
With this check, the tax office found that the Czech payer had included in the VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German payer before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
For the tax year of Q3 2004, the tax office charged VAT to the taxpayer in the amount of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).
BRH found out, as requested by the SAO, that the German payer was not assigned the VAT ID until 16.2.2005 when he informed the IRS of his business, which he started in 2004.
In addition, the tax office registered it for VAT retrospectively on 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the filing of the annual VAT return for 2004.
In this tax return, the payer declared an intra-Community acquisition from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. £5,000).
3. The Czech payer declared a supply of goods worth 114 615 CZK (3 642 euro) to the German payer in the VAT return for September 2004 and SH for the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech tax authority, when verifying the registration of a German payer in the VIES system, found that his registration was valid from 11.11.2004, i.e. only after the delivery of the goods by the Czech payer to the SRN.
The Czech payer filed an additional DAP for VAT, in which he declared the taxable amount of the transactions effected within the country, worth CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and the VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692) which he had paid.
The SAO enquired at the local tax office in the Czech Republic and found that the Czech payer had subsequently submitted a request for a retrial in respect of the additional VAT return and provided as evidence confirmation by the German tax administration that the German payer had been taxed since 1 January 2000.
That is why the Czech tax authorities verified the validity of the German payer's registration in the framework of the international exchange of information.
The reply received from the German Government showed that the VAT ID was not allocated to the German payer until 11.11.2004, i.e. after the date on which the goods were delivered.
For this reason, the tax administration in the Czech Republic rejected the request for a retrial.
BRH found that this was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods because the German payer had obtained the VAT ID only on 11.11.2004.
However, the German recipient declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and declared the VAT on that acquisition by claiming a refund of input tax of the same amount.
However, as there would have been no changes in the value of the VAT payable by the German taxpayer, the tax authorities in Germany did not correct the figures in his VAT return.
BRH further found that the name of the German payer, given in the RGI, had been changed during the processing of the reply in the SRN, resulting in confusion between two German tax entities.
This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax authorities.
4.
In the framework of the international exchange of information, the German tax authorities verified the acquisition of goods by a Czech payer in the first quarter of 2005 for a value of EUR 22 686 from a German payer.
The SAO enquired the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic and found that this administrator had carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer, verifying that the delivery of the goods had taken place and that the Czech payer had accounted for and paid the invoice for the goods in question.
The Czech payer did not declare the acquisition of the goods on the VAT return because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
In the application of VIES, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only from 21.4.2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech payer.
At the same time, the Czech tax authority asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the registration certificate for the German payer so that, if necessary, it could take steps to assess the tax.
The Czech Tax Office assessed the transaction in question as an acquisition of goods from a non-payer of the FRG and therefore did not charge the Czech payer the tax retrospectively on that transaction.
BRH found that, under German law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order for an intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.
The supplier only has to have the VAT ID of the customer from another Member State and be able to prove that the goods are transported to another Member State.
Under the German VAT law, it was therefore an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be assessed in the Czech Republic.
In any event, it is important that the Czech tax authorities noticed this transaction, as the delivery of the machine at that value was not the basic business of the German supplier.
As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to respond to the YEI concerning intra-Community transactions of less than EUR 15 000: 5.
According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased EUR 12 561 worth of goods from the German payer in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech tax authority carried out a tax audit on the taxpayer for this tax year.
In the context of international administrative cooperation, he asked the German tax authorities, using the SCAC form, to verify the delivery of those goods.
The Czech payer denied acquiring the goods, claiming that he had never traded with the German company and that the acquisition of the goods was not accounted for in his accounts.
The German tax administration rejected the requirement to provide evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, arguing that the turnover did not exceed the value of EUR 15 000 and no further explanatory reasoning was given.
Since the Czech tax authorities did not obtain evidence to assess the tax on the goods acquired, they ended the tax inspection without finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.
BRH found, as requested by the SAO, that the German payer acted as a so-called "fiscal representative" (§ 22 a – e UStG).
The German payer declared these deliveries in his annual VAT return and in the SH.
He was granted the right to free delivery.
Based on the BRH's warning, the German tax office will send to the Czech Republic the supporting documents needed to assess the tax on the purchased goods in the Czech Republic.
As stated in Chapter 4.6.1 of the reply to the JOI sent from the SRN to the Czech Republic, they exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the answers from the Czech Republic to the SRN: 6.
The SAO's audit found that the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to the SRN on 5.10.2005 regarding the verification of the value of the delivered goods for the 4th quarter of 2004.
The German payer declared a supply of goods to the Czech payer worth EUR 86 307 in the SH for this period, but the Czech payer declared in the VAT return the acquisition of goods only worth EUR 35 314 in the same period.
In its reply to the ŽOI, received in the Czech Republic on May 9, 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the deadline for processing laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the application could not be processed as the German firm's operations had ceased at the end of 2005.
By failing to comply with the deadline for processing the ŽOI, the German tax administration did not have the necessary documents for the tax procedure in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator applied through the SCAC form for verification of the delivery of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to a German payer, made in Q3 and Q4 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
The SAO found that there had been no response to YES from the SRN by the time of the inspection.
The SAO also found, by enquiry with the local tax authority, that the Czech taxpayer had not included in the VAT return the supply of new means of transport for the German taxpayer, worth CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375,472).
The Czech Tax Administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech Tax Entity filed the subsequent SH.
BRH found, as requested by the SAO, that for technical reasons the German CLO had not forwarded the above mentioned ZhOI to the local tax office for verification.
Following the BRH warning, a check was carried out at the German acquirer's office in Germany, which found that the acquisition of all cars had been properly taxed and that the cars in question had been sold to the next payer in Germany.
8. According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased a passenger car from the German payer in the 4th quarter of 2004 for a value of EUR 48 500.
The acquisition of these goods was not acknowledged by the Czech payer.
An enquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic revealed that the Czech taxpayer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.
The tax returns were not filed by the Czech taxpayer even after calls from the tax administration, so on 23 May 2005 the tax office charged him VAT of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004.
On 2.6.2005 CLO drew attention to the abovementioned supply from the German payer.
Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax authorities, the tax authorities sent the ŽOI to the SRN, concerning the aforementioned supplies.
Since the reply to the JOI was not delivered to the Czech Republic until 7.2.2007, it was not known until the end of the audit of the SAO how the Czech tax administration used the information obtained by the international exchange.
On 23 August 2005, the tax office revoked the VAT registration of the Czech taxpayer on account of his failure to comply with the VAT Act.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent to the RU, as the audit carried out by the tax authorities on the payers was not completed at the time of the SAO and BRH audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax authorities requested through the SCAC form a verification of the delivery of a car worth EUR 16 991 to a German payer, made in the third quarter of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
In its reply to Zhoei, the German tax authorities stated that they had only an invoice issued by the Czech payer for a delivery of EUR 16 335.
BRH found, as requested by the SAO, that the audit carried out by the German tax office on the purchaser of the SRN had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice, in tax returns for August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, through the SCAC form, an examination of the delivery of cars to a German payer worth EUR 198 167, made in Q4 2004 and QI 2005, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the JOI to the Czech Republic in which it confirmed the acquisition of some cars by a German payer and further stated that the investigation into the SRN had not been completed.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The SAO found that several local investigations were carried out at the Czech contractor's premises by the local tax office in order to verify the use of excess VAT deductions, which did not identify any undue drawings.
BRH found that the German payer had declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States for a total value of EUR 579 114 during that period and that the check carried out by the German tax office on the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.
Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the intra-community acquisition values given by the recipient in the tax return and those given by the supplier in its SH.
The audited cases showed that the most common reasons for the differences were not the time lag or the misrepresentation of the value of intra-Community supplies of goods in the SH:
11.
In Q1 2005, according to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German payer, but the Czech payer did not acknowledge this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax authorities and did not carry out any activities at the company's registered office, the Czech tax authorities requested, in the framework of an international exchange of information, to verify how the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.
The reply to the RU from the SRN showed that the German tax administration had established that the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the address communicated and that the goods had been taken over by the contracted carrier.
The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer only delivered goods worth EUR 21 659.
The Czech payer sent the German payer a false certificate of payment of EUR 155 153 in favour of the German payer.
After discovering fraudulent behaviour on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7 916.
The SAO enquired at the local tax office in the Czech Republic and found that, based on information obtained, the tax administrator had charged the Czech taxpayer VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States amounting to CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).
BRH confirmed, as requested by the SAO, that the German supplier had reported only EUR 7,916 worth of supplies to the Czech payer after repairs.
According to the German legal situation, the German payer reported the corrected values of the goods and a reduction in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the correction took place.
Thus, his SH contained the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax authorities requested through the SCAC form to verify the supply of goods and services made in the third quarter of 2005.
According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer was to deliver goods worth a total of EUR 396 126 to the German payer during this period and to provide services worth EUR 11 885.
The SAO found that a local investigation had been carried out by the Czech tax administration to verify this supply with the Czech payer.
In reply to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech payer supplied the German payer with a production line including assembly.
Individual parts of the production line were supplied by the Czech payer before the Czech Republic joined the EU, and after 1.5.2004 the line was assembled on the basis of an order.
The German payer did not take over the assembled line because it claimed to have defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for the amounts of EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.
The German payer took the invoices issued but did not acknowledge them and did not pay them.
The SAO also discovered that all invoices are properly registered in the accounts of the Czech payer by enquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic.
Only the amounts evidenced by the Czech payer and relating to invoicing after 1.5.2004 are shown in the VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005.
BRH found that, based on a reply from the Czech tax administration, the local tax office in Germany concluded that the transaction in question was a supply of goods from a Czech payer to a German payer, including services for assembly.
In this particular case, the place of the so-called fulfilment of work is where the assembly of the production line took place.
Under German VAT law, the German recipient of the service supplied is liable to pay VAT.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a VAT deduction on the same amount.
As there would be no changes in the value of the VAT payable by the German taxpayer, the corrections in the VAT return were neglected by the German tax office.
13. In February 2005, Czech payer A was to purchase a machine worth €58,000 from German payer C, according to VIES data.
The Czech tax authority sent a request to the FRG to verify this supply.
In reply to the Yi, the German side stated that this machine had already been delivered by German payer C to Czech payer B in 2004, but that this machine was to be returned to German payer C in October 2004.
According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to the SRN, but was transported to the organization of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, the reply to the request for information showed that the German payer C had sold the machine to Czech payer A in February 2005.
This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organization of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.
Since the delivery was made only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intra-Community supply of goods.
The SAO enquired from the tax administration of the local payer B and found that according to VIES, German payer C delivered goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027 to Czech payer B in the third quarter of 2004.
Payer B denied this acquisition of goods, so the locally competent tax authority from the Czech Republic sent the RU to the FRG.
According to the response to that request, the delivery of the machine took place.
Further investigation with payer B found that the machine, worth EUR 88 027, was not in payer B's accounts, and that it could be a machine of the same type as that supplied by the organisation of German payer C to Czech payer A in February 2005.
The SAO also found that the Czech tax administrator of the local tax payer A carried out a local investigation on this payer.
The tax authorities had at their disposal an invoice from German payer C dated 7.2.2005, which identified payer A as the purchaser of the machine.
The Czech Tax Administrator found that Payer A did not have this invoice included in the accounts.
Payer A had a lease agreement with another Czech company where the subject of the lease was a machine of the same type.
The transfer of the machine from the leasing company took place on 9.2.2005, the transport of the machine was provided by the leasing company.
The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech tax office to establish the tax liability of Payer A.
BRH found that German payer C did not deliver a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.
It was not therefore an intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable supply in Germany.
For these reasons, the German tax authorities did not grant C, the German taxpayer, a VAT exemption and corrected the figures in his tax return.
German payer D supplied the machine to Czech payer B.
Under German law, that supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, BRH found that German payer C reported in its SH for QI 2005 the delivery of a machine worth EUR 58 000 to Czech payer A.
That supply was not verified during a tax audit carried out by the German tax office.
The following diagram shows the relationships between participants in the above business transactions.
14.
The SAO's audit of the accepted ŽOI found that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from the FRG on 4.10.2005, in which the German tax administration requested verification of an intra-Community supply from a German payer worth EUR 879 680 625 to a Czech payer.
According to the German tax authorities, there was a suspicion that this was a sham intra-Community supply of goods.
It was further stated in the RBI that the German payer had not engaged in any active commercial activity since 1999.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administration had carried out a local investigation on the Czech payer.
According to the observations of the manager of the Czech company, the aforementioned case appears to have involved a claim by the German taxpayer against the German tax authorities, which was claimed by the Czech taxpayer as a partner in a German company with the German tax authority.
According to information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administration has no information to date that the issue related to the Czech payer has been addressed by the German tax administration.
According to the available information, it was not a supply of goods, yet the value is still included in VIES as an intra-Community supply of goods to a Czech payer from the FRG.
The main reason for the following irregularities was that the beneficiaries did not report intra-Community acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also Chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to the VIES data, the German payer delivered goods totalling EUR 33 205 to the Czech payer in Q3 2004 to QI 2005. The Czech payer did not acknowledge this acquisition.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The Czech tax administration has requested verification of the supply of goods from the FRG as part of an international exchange of information.
In response to that request, the German tax authorities stated that the German payer had sent some of the goods to the address of the Czech payer, the remaining goods being collected by the Czech payer himself.
An inquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic revealed that even before receiving the reply to the ŽOI, the Czech payer had submitted additional VAT returns for the periods mentioned.
Despite this submission, the differences in acquisition values have not been resolved, so the Czech tax authorities recommended a tax audit of the Czech taxpayer.
The check has not yet been carried out.
16. The German payer delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to the Czech payer in the third quarter of 2004 as reported in VIES.
The Czech payer only granted intra-Community acquisitions for the same period of EUR 14 856.
The Czech tax authority requested verification in the framework of the international exchange of information of the value of the supplies made.
The reply to the JOI, received from the SRN, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total declared value of the delivery of the goods of EUR 31 999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the VIES data.
The SAO's inquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic revealed that after receiving the reply from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the Czech taxpayer's accountant and agreed with her to discuss the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004, after examining these invoices with the company owner.
No additional VAT return has yet been filed.
The Czech Tax Administrator told the SAO that it would proceed further to meet the deadlines for any additional VAT assessment for the relevant tax period.
17.
The German payer was due to deliver EUR 11,600 worth of goods to the Czech payer in Q4 2004.
In an international exchange of information, the German tax authorities asked for confirmation of whether the Czech payer actually existed, as the alleged partner of the German payer had set up more fictitious companies in the SRN.
When examining the business transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition to the tax office.
However, according to the Czech payer, the goods were not shipped from Germany to the Czech Republic and were resold during 2005 in Germany.
The Czech payer submitted sales notes for January 2005.
The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, neither declared nor paid the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic nor in Germany.
All these facts suggested tax evasion within the territory of the FRG and were communicated by the Czech tax administration to the German tax administration in its reply to the GI.
The SAO's enquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic revealed that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the fourth quarter of 2004, including the value of the acquisition of goods from, inter alia, the German taxpayer, while claiming the right to deduct tax on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.
He did not enter VAT on the sale of goods in Germany on the Czech VAT return.
The Czech tax administration assessed the additional VAT return unchanged following a local investigation.
According to Czech legislation, that case did not involve the acquisition of goods from other Member States because the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administration therefore made the wrong conclusion of the local investigation.
BRH found that the German tax authorities corrected the German taxpayer's tax return immediately after receiving a reply to the ŽOI in which it was stated that the goods had not left the FRG and demanded VAT from him in the amount of EUR 1 600.
In addition, the relevant tax authority has sent a notice to the tax office of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of those goods is correctly taxed.
In the following cases, payers reported intra-community transactions that were unlikely to actually occur:
18.
The Czech tax authority received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech payer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from a German payer in February 2005.
Attached to the application was a copy of the Czech payer's VAT registration certificate.
In addition, a copy of the passport of the person who, as has been said, was to carry out the transfer of that car was attached.
An investigation by the Czech tax authorities found that this was a stolen passport, the person named therein had not imported any vehicle into the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax entity.
The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German side, was never issued by the Czech tax authorities.
This information was included by the Czech tax authorities in their reply to the ZhOI, together with a statement that they could not confirm the acquisition of the goods – the car in question.
The SAO's inquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic found that the Czech payer did not reside at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the company's manager was uncontactable.
The Czech tax authority, following the complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax year, assessed the Czech taxpayer's tax liability at CZK 0.
Further investigation by the Czech tax authorities found that the car in question had been sold to another Czech entity, which had bought it through an advertisement on the internet.
BRH found that the locally competent German tax authority, on the basis of the Czech answer to the ZhOI, would not recognise the German payer's entitlement to the VAT exemption for that supply.
19. During the inspection, the German tax office was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3 000 between the value of the goods acquired declared on the payer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.
It was disclosed that the Czech payer was to deliver goods worth EUR 89 424 to the German payer during QIV 2004 to QI 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the VIES data, the German tax authorities requested verification of the supplies and their payment in the framework of the international exchange of information.
The Czech tax administrator stated in his reply to the ŽOI that the only female manager of the Czech company had been removed from the Commercial Register on 8.7.2005 and the new manager had not been registered.
The German recipient of the goods appeared to be a relative of a Czech company partner.
The Czech payer filed tax returns for both VAT and SH, which were signed by an unauthorised person – that partner of the firm – after the agent was erased from the Commercial Register.
The Czech taxpayer's accountant confirmed to the tax authority that the company's partner had deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
The SAO in the Czech Republic, when questioned by the local tax office, found that the tax administrator had recognised the Czech payer's right to VAT exemption for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the delivery of goods to another Member State worth CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) and for the first quarter of 2005 of CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548).
BRH found that the tax authorities in Germany had failed to correct the German acquirer's VAT return because a German judge had in the meantime confirmed the German payer's insolvency.
Since an earlier check revealed no evidence of tax fraud, it will not be possible to recover the tax liability assessed.
20. According to data in VIES, a German payer purchased goods worth €4,251,196 from the Czech Republic in 2005 after acquiring goods worth €43,274 the previous year.
In both the 2004 tax return and the 2005 tax return, the German payer did not report intra-Community acquisitions.
It also failed to report adequate supplies.
Due to these differences, the German Tax Office sent a YEI, covering Q4 2005 and Q1 2006.
The Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods to a German payer in the SH for these two quarters, totalling CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).
On 6.9.2006, the ŽOI was received, in which the German side asked to verify that the intra-Community deliveries declared by the Czech payer had taken place.
In reply to this ŽOI, the Czech tax administration stated that the request of the German side could not be met because the Czech payer had no manager.
As is clear from the materials provided to the SAO by the competent tax authority, a report was drawn up with the Czech taxpayer's manager on the start of the VAT inspection for Q4 2004 and January to December 2005.
At the same time, the taxpayer was asked by the tax authorities to produce all accounting and tax documents for the aforementioned periods, but no documents were produced.
The sole agent of the Czech payer ceased to hold office on 16 May 2006, according to the Commercial Register, and the new director was not appointed.
Since April 2006, the Czech taxpayer has stopped submitting VAT returns.
As part of the audit, the SAO, in cooperation with BRH, also examined several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the tax administrations of the two countries.
Information on the cases reviewed was transmitted between the two supreme audit institutions through the CLOs of both countries.
21. A Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany has informed the competent tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out taxable transactions in Germany.
Because of this information, the company has been registered since June 2005 but has not received the German VAT ID.
(ECR) has accepted an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind farms and for the delivery of these wind farms in the name, at risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.
Due to a lack of own capacity, the Czech company passed part of the order to a German payer (eD) based in Germany.
The following diagram shows the contractual relationships and mode of transport of wind farms:
According to the German legal situation, the location of these transactions must be determined according to the following:
– A Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent the wind farms to be assembled under his name, at his risk and his account in Austria.
Since the installation of that supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind farms is taxable in Austria.
– Since the carrier was instructed by a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and on his own behalf, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport started - in Germany.
Although the wind farms were dispatched to another Member State and the beneficiary is a registered payer from another Member State, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) could not receive an exemption because the other Member State of destination differs from the other Member State of residence of the Czech company.
This supply is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted the input tax in its tax returns.
The delivery location of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of transportation.
The transport of some wind farms started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.
– The delivery of those wind farms, which are produced in the Czech Republic, took place in the Czech Republic.
– Supply of other wind farms that are produced in Germany took place in Germany.
So the Czech company (eCR) made both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not declare any intra-Community acquisitions in its VAT return in Germany or submit the SH to the German CLO.
So it's possible that the Czech company reported all intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The SAO found that the (eCR) did not report any intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
An examination of the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although this case shows no sign of tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the SAO and BRH examined the transactions to highlight the differences between the reporting in the tax return and the VIES data, which were due to different VAT legislation in 2004.
The audited cases also demonstrate that changes to the legislation take time to implement the new legislation by both the payers and the tax authorities:
22. In the SH for Q4 II-IV 2004, the Czech payer reported intra-Community deliveries to the German payer for a total value of CZK 792 977 452 (EUR 25 197 885).
Over the same period, another Czech payer in SH reported intra-Community delivery to another German payer for a total value of 18,157,265 CZK (576,970 euro).
According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.
Both Czech payers listed the above supplies in the SH in accordance with the text of Act No 235/2004 Coll., in force in 2004.
Further examination of the above transactions, the auditing group found that in 2004 there were differences between the CR and the FRG in the legal arrangements for the supply and purchase of electricity respectively.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the payers reported the supply of electricity in accordance with the applicable text of Act No 235/2004 Coll. as an intra-Community supply of goods, from the point of view of the German legislation in force in 2004 it was not an intra-Community acquisition but a taxable transaction with a place of performance in the territory of the German Federal Republic.
The difference in statutory regulations was eliminated in the Czech Republic with the adoption of Act No 635/2004 Coll. amending certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Administrative Fees Act, effective from 1.1.2005.
23. Furthermore, when examining selected intra-Community transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was found that the Czech payer reported in the SH for Q1-4 2005 intra-Community deliveries to the German payer totalling CZK 240 411 163 (EUR 8 071 823) and another Czech payer reported in the SH for the same period intra-Community deliveries to the German payer totalling CZK 263 470 776 (EUR 8 846 050).
According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.
Pursuant to the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., in force since 1.1.2005, in the case of the supply of electricity, the place of performance is the place where the customer has his registered office, place of business or has an establishment for which the goods are supplied.
Therefore, Czech payers should not have declared the supply of electricity to SH in 2005.
By reporting intra-Community supply of electricity in SH, the two payers mentioned above distorted data in VIES by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).
Conclusion
The cooperation fulfilled the objectives of the BRH and the SAO.
Both SAIs have acquired a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed the differences between the two systems and showed that the VAT administration legislation differs.
Suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were identified during parallel controls.
Some of them make sense to check out afterwards.
Based on the audit findings, the two SAIs made recommendations on VAT administration.
The follow-up of these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two audit institutions is the basis for the successful implementation of the following VAT administration checks.

Report on the outcome of international cooperation in checks on the management of excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006
Introduction Word
The submitted joint report reports on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel controls carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky, aimed at the management of excise duties in the period after the accession of the two countries to the European Union.
The cooperation was carried out on the basis of a contract for cooperation in control activities, concluded in February 2006.
The topic of parallel controls was chosen in view of the fundamental change in the system for collecting excise duties which has taken place in the context of the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union since 1 May 2004.
The functioning of the European Union's internal market requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.
The basic principle is to allow goods not subject to tax to circulate until the day they are delivered for final consumption.
In accordance with that principle, the new legislation, adopted in both countries, allows the movement of goods under tax supervision under a conditional exemption scheme.
The system places great demands on tax administrations and foresees close interaction between the competent administrations of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud in this area.
Report on the outcome of international cooperation on controls of excise administration for the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.
Introduction
Check Number: (Czech Republic) 05/34 (SR) 48/11
Subject of inspection: (Czech Republic) Excise Management (SR) Procedure of colné orgánov pri správe spotrebá tax
The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO-CR) and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky (hereinafter referred to as the SAO of the Slovak Republic) concluded on 8 February 2006 the ‘Contract on Cooperation in Audit Activity’.
The subject of the contract was cooperation in parallel checks ‘Administration of Excise Duties’, included in the SAO-CR's 2005 audit work plan under No 05/34, and ‘Control of the progress of colné orgánov in administering rebrebrebrebrebate taxes’, included in the SAO SR's 2006 audit work plan under No 48/11.
The parallel checks were in the nature of coordinated checks.
The cooperation consisted of exchanging information that could not be obtained by the contracting parties when checking the management of excise duties on their national territory and producing a joint final report on the outcome of the checks within the meaning of the European implementing directives for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards - Directive No 31.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, control groups from the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of central Bohemia, southern Bohemia, western Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia carried out inspections between 7 February and 2 June 2006.
27 inspectors were involved in the inspection.
The persons audited were the Directorate General of Customs (DG) and 11 tax authorities.
Within the DG, 12 selected customs offices were audited out of a total of 54.
The audit in the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as ‘SR’) was carried out by the Finance and Tax Office of the SAO of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the expositories of the SAO of Banská Bystrica and Košice at 5 customs offices out of a total of 9 between 13 February and 2 June 2006.
Eight inspectors were involved in the inspection.
The aim of the parallel controls was to examine the customs authorities' handling of excise duties and compliance with the relevant legislation in force in both countries and in the European Union.
International cooperation has focused on the procedure of tax administrations in exercising supervision over the transport of excise goods, in particular on the registration of commenced and completed shipments under the conditional exemption regime, and on the exchange of information in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between excise tax administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
2. Excise management
The administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic was carried out by financial authorities until 31 December 2003.
Since 1 January 2004, this agenda has been taken up by customs authorities, who have hitherto levied excise duty only on imports.
In the Czech Republic, mineral oils, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products are subject to excise duty.
The state budget's revenue from excise duties in the Czech Republic totalled CZK 82.8 billion in 2004, and excise taxes accounted for 19.5% of the state budget's revenue from taxes and duties of CZK 424.7 billion.
In 2005, the State budget revenue from excise duties amounted to CZK 103.6 billion and the State budget revenue share from taxes and duties amounted to CZK 460.4 billion was 22.5%.
In 2004, the revenue from excise duty on mineral oils to the national budget was 80% of the total revenue from this tax and in 2005 it was 90.9%.
The difference to 100% of CZK 13 billion in 2004 and CZK 6.9 billion in 2005 was the income of the State Fund of Transport Infrastructure.
The administration of all excise duties in the SR has been carried out by the customs authorities since 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise duty on mineral oil, which they have administered since 1 January 2002.
Until then, excise duties were administered by the tax authorities.
Excise duty in the SR is levied on mineral oil, alcohol, beer, wine and tobacco products.
The State budget's revenue from excise duties in the Slovak Republic totalled EUR 43.4 billion in 2004 and accounted for 20.7% of total tax revenue of EUR 209.5 billion.
In 2005, the government budget revenue from excise duties was 50 billion units and the total tax revenue was 222.6 billion. The excise taxes accounted for 22.5%.

- Council Directive 92/12/EEC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (hereinafter referred to as 'Directive 92/12/EEC'), - Council Regulation (EC) No 2073/2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as 'Regulation No 2073/2004'), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92 on the accompanying official document for the movement of products subject to excise duty under excise duty exemption (hereinafter referred to as 'Regulation No 2719/92'), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3649/92/EEC for movement of products subject to a simplified movement within a Member State.
The basic legislation governing the issue of excise duties in the Czech Republic is Act No 353/2003 Coll., on excise duties, as amended, (hereinafter referred to as Act No 353/2003 Coll.) in force from 1 January 2004.
In administering excise duties in the Slovak Republic, the customs authorities are bound, inter alia, by the following generally binding provisions: - Act No 98/2004 on the spot tax on mineral oil in the pollution of non-mineral predpissoffs (hereinafter referred to as “Act No 98/2004 Z. z.”); - Act No 104/2004 Z. z. z. o. on the spot tax on wine in the pollution of non-mineral predpissos (hereinafter referred to as “Act No 104/2004 Z. Z. z.”); - Act No 105/2004 Z. Z. on the spot tax on beer in the pre-spot tax (Act No 107).
2.1 Movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement between Member States of the European Union
The conditions of movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement are governed by Directive 92/12/EEC in Title III — Movement of goods Articles 15 to 20.
Under those provisions, the transport of those goods may be effected only by an authorised warehousekeeper, who means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of a Member State to manufacture, process, store, receive and dispatch products subject to excise duty.
A consignee in another Member State may be an authorised warehousekeeper or an economic operator without the status of authorised warehousekeeper, but who may not store or re-dispatch such products under a suspension arrangement.
Authorised warehousekeeper in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic means a tax warehouse operator, economic operator is an authorised consignee for repeated or one-off acceptance of products subject to excise duty.
Under Directive 92/12/EEC, the movement of products subject to excise duty under a duty suspension arrangement is only possible with an accompanying document.
The accompanying document shall be drawn up by the consignor in four copies before the transport begins, unless the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch require a further copy.
2.2 Procedure for the start and end of the transport of goods under the conditional exemption regime between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Transport from CR
The procedure for commencing transport is governed by Section 25, paragraph 3 of Act No 353/2003 Coll., which states, inter alia:
‘The tax warehouse operator shall, before commencing the transport of selected products, inform the customs office which is the local competent tax warehouse from which the transport is to commence;
transport of selected products may only commence with the approval of this customs office.
The customs office shall give its consent for the transport of the selected products without delay after the condition of securing the tax has been fulfilled ..."
The sender in the Czech Republic can start transport of all types of products subject to excise duty only with the consent of the local competent customs office.
The customs office shall give its consent to the commencement of the transport only if security of tax in the amount of tax attributable to the products transported is provided.
The consignor shall draw up an accompanying document in five copies before commencing transport.
The customs office shall indicate on the accompanying document the consent to commence transport.
Copy No 1 shall be kept by the consignor, copy No 2, 3, and copy No 4 shall be handed over by the consignor to the haulier and copy No 5 shall be kept by the customs office authorising transport.
Under Slovak law, the recipient keeps copy No 2 of the accompanying document in SR. They shall confirm receipt of the products on copies 3 and 4 and shall submit both copies to the customs office responsible for them locally.
Copy No 3 certified by the customs office shall be sent to the consignor no later than the 15th day of the month following the calendar month in which he received the products.
Copy No 4 shall be kept by the customs office of the consignee.
Transport is terminated by the acceptance of products by the beneficiary.
The release of the securing of the tax will be decided by the customs office in the Czech Republic, which authorised the start of the transport, within 5 working days after the presentation of copy No 3 of the accompanying document, which is certified by the consignee and the Slovak customs office.
Chart 2 — Circulation of the accompanying document for transport started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Slovak Republic
Transport from SR
The procedure for transporting alcohol and tobacco products from SR to another Member State of the European Union was modified until 31 December 2005 as follows:
Pursuant to Article 26(4) of Law 105/2004 Z.z.
‘Pri preprave liehu from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to a tax warehouse or to a lawful beneficiary, alebo to a tax splnomocnencovi v inom členskom štáte je odosielatel’ (the deliverer’) the obligatory on the day before atia prepravy to send a kópiu of the first dielu sprievodného document electronically alebo faxom Colný úradu Poprad; tAttack kópiu is obligatory to send also colý úradu písomne to the piatich of the working days odo dňa beg a prepravy. "
Pursuant to Article 22(4) of Act No 106/2004 Z.z.
‘Pri preprave tabak productions from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to a tax warehouse or to a lawful beneficiary, alebo tax splnomocnencovi v inom členskom štáte je odosielatel’ (the supplier) obligated in the present day to send a kópiu of the first dielu sprievodný Document electronically alebo faxom Colný úradu Poprad; tAttack kópiu is obligatory to send a colaj úradu písomne najor na piatich working days odo dňaňa bega prepravy. "
When transporting other products subject to excise duty (mineral oil, wine and beer) between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005 (‘the period under scrutiny’), the taxpayer was under no obligation to notify the customs office Poprad or the competent customs office of the commencement of transport under a duty suspension arrangement.
It was only during a local investigation or a tax inspection that the tax authorities became aware of the transport of these products from the accompanying documents and the taxpayer's accounting documents.
The consignor in SR shall draw up the accompanying document in four copies before commencing transport.
Copy No 1 shall be kept by the consignor (when transporting alcohol and tobacco products, he shall send a copy of Copy No 1 electronically or by fax to the customs office Poprad and the competent customs office).
Copies Nos 2, 3 and 4 shall accompany the goods being transported.
Under Czech law, the consignee in the Czech Republic keeps copy No 2 of the accompanying document drawn up by the consignor in the Slovak Republic and acknowledges receipt of the products on copies No 3 and 4.
The certified copies No 3 and No 4 shall be sent at the latest on the first working day after the transport is completed to the local competent customs office in the Czech Republic.
The customs office shall retain copy No 4 and return copy No 3, on which it shall verify the accuracy and validity, to the consignee.
The consignee shall send the certified copy No 3 to the consignor in SR at the latest on the following working day after receipt.
Transport in SR shall be deemed to have ended on the day the products are taken over by the recipient.
Termination of the transport shall be proved by the consignor by production of copy No 3 of the accompanying document certified by the consignee and the tax authority in the Czech Republic.
Graph 3 — Circulation of the accompanying document in transport (alcohol and tobacco products) started in SR and finished in CR
In 2006, amendments to all excise laws were progressively adopted in SR, under which the consignor of goods under a duty suspension arrangement is required to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office of the locally competent consignor before commencing transport.
The document proving the cessation of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products shall be Copy No 3 of the accompanying document, certified by the consignee and his competent tax authority.
The document proving the end of the transport of mineral oils, wine and beer is Copy No 3, certified by the consignee.
The confirmation by the tax authorities of another Member State of the receipt of the said goods by the consignee shall be required where the latter is required under the legislation of the Member State concerned to certify copy No 3 of the accompanying document.
2.3 Registration of shipments initiated and terminated by customs authorities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
There is no single electronic system in place to monitor the transport of goods under a duty suspension arrangement between the Member States of the European Union.
Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the implementation of an electronic system for the movement and monitoring of excisable products requires Member States and the European Commission to implement, from 1 July 2009, an electronic system (Excise Movement and Control System) enabling excise administrators in individual Member States to obtain real-time information on the transport of goods.
The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently only used in paper form, and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under the conditional exemption regime and to ensuring more effective control of the movement of untaxed products within all Member States.
This system will include national transport databases of individual Member States.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all traffic initiated and terminated on the territory of the Czech Republic in the Register of Selected Products (EVV) module.
All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have online access to the system.
In the case of shipments carried out only in the territory of the Czech Republic, tax authorities can obtain information about the start or end of transport immediately after the registration of the accompanying document by the customs office in EVV.
The customs office shall release the securing of the tax on the goods conveyed by the consignor when the end of the transport is registered by the customs office to the locally competent consignee.
Customs offices in SR use a database based on the SysNed application software which provides automation of their excise management activities and communication with European Union systems.
By registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or authorised beneficiary in the SysNed application software, that data is automatically transferred to the System for Exchange of Excise Data (SEED) database.
3. Preparation and conduct of cooperation
The first coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO-Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO of the Slovak Republic, which discussed the concrete process of cooperation in the implementation of parallel controls in the field of excise duties, took place in January 2006.
The two sides have become acquainted with the excise legislation and the excise management organisation in both states.
Particular attention was paid to the procedure of the Customs Authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic in authorising and/or beginning and ending the movement of excise products under the duty suspension arrangement and the exchange of information between the excise administrations of the two countries.
At the meeting, it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak sides: - will process total data on the quantities of excise products shipped from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic and vice versa, the transport of which started during the audited period, - will compare data on the transport of mineral oils - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and ethyl alcohol - Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 under the conditional exemption scheme started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Slovak Republic and vice versa in November 2004 and September 2005.
During the inspections, the periods examined were extended to the months of October and November 2005 and the transport of tobacco products under a duty suspension arrangement was also subject to an inspection during those months.
Tables 1 and 2 show the total amount of excise goods that were transported under the duty suspension arrangement between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the audited period.
4. Comparison of transport records of goods under conditional exemption
The SAO-CR provided the Slovak side with a database of transport operations completed in the Czech Republic, which included a total of 5 876 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 5 738 related to mineral oils, 134 to ethyl alcohol and 4 to tobacco products.
The SAO of the Slovak Republic forwarded to the Czech side a database of transport operations completed in the Slovak Republic, which included a total of 3 319 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 696 related to mineral oil, 2 066 to ethyl alcohol and 557 to tobacco products.
The SAO-CR compared the data on the shipments listed in the register of initiated shipments in the Czech Republic with the data on terminated shipments registered in the Slovak Republic.
The results of the comparison are shown in Table 3.
The transport data for the months of November 2004 and September 2005 were compared by the SAO-CR with the database of the Slovak Customs Administration, which the SAO handed over to him at the beginning of the inspection.
The database did not contain data allowing reliable reconciliation of individual traffic and therefore only 63% of traffic started were attributable.
Individual transports were assigned according to multiple data, e.g. sender, receiver, transport date, amount of products transported.
Data on shipments started in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic in the months of October and November 2005 were compared by the SAO-Czech Republic with the database of the Slovak Customs Administration, which contained all data according to accompanying documents, on the basis of which 93% of the shipments started were unambiguously attributed.
In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the quantity of mineral oils was given in litres or tonnes, depending on the type of mineral oil.
The quantity of alcohol was, in most cases, stated in litres, but this could be converted into litres of absolute alcohol on the basis of the database of that percentage of alcohol.
Quantities of tobacco products were given in pieces, in thousands of pieces and kilograms by type of tobacco products.
Shipments initiated in the Czech Republic whose termination could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database, or whose data on the quantity of products transported did not match, were checked with the accompanying documents.
Accompanying documents for 487 shipments of ethyl alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were inspected.
A check of these documents was carried out at the customs offices where the SAO-CR carried out the check.
For shipments authorised by other customs offices, accompanying documents were requested through DG C.
The Czech side asked the Slovak side to verify the realisation of 141 transport operations for which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not provide the certified copies No 3 of the accompanying document, or the quantity of products indicated on the accompanying document did not agree with the quantity of products indicated in the database.
In addition, the Slovak side was transmitted traffic data registered in the Slovak database, which the transport database of the Czech customs administration did not contain.
The SAO SR searched the database of the Slovak Customs Service for 95 traffic.
Verification of the remaining 46 transport operations was requested by the competent customs offices locally, which proved their completion with copies of the accompanying documents.
The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side copies of the accompanying documents, on the basis of which the transport was also identified in the Czech database, with the exception of the transport carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of the initiated transport.
The following cases were checked:
- the Slovak database of transport registered 11 shipments of ethyl alcohol in a total quantity of 276.7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 shipments of ethyl alcohol in a total quantity of 404.66 litres of alcohol carried out in 2005.
The SAO-CR found that this was a transport of taxed products that the sender does not need the approval of the tax administration to start.
The dispatcher informed the tax authorities in writing of the start of the service. The transport was carried out on the basis of accompanying documents used for the transport of products under a duty suspension arrangement;
- A total of 94 mineral oil shipments, combined nomenclature code 2710 11 21, were registered in the Slovak transport database, in a total volume of 173,000 litres carried out by the Czech tax entity between September 2004 and December 2005.
The SAO-CR found that between May 2004 and June 2005, the tax entity carried out the transport of 102,000 litres of untaxed mineral oils without the proper authorisation.
The taxpayer held a special licence to receive and use exempt products, under which tax-free products could be supplied only to the holder of the same licence.
He did not notify the initiation of the transport to the customs office in the Czech Republic and did not provide security of tax of CZK 1,207,680 on the products shipped.
Between July 2005 and December 2005, the taxpayer shipped 71 000 litres of taxed mineral oils into SR. Even in those cases, he failed to comply with a legal obligation by failing to notify the customs office of the commencement of the transport operations.
Shipping of products put into free circulation on the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State may be initiated by the shipper in the Czech Republic without the approval of the customs office, but he is required to notify the customs office in writing before the transport begins.
A taxpayer who purchases products put into free circulation in another Member State is required to declare the quantity and secure the tax before they are collected.
Products may only be transported with a simplified accompanying document, the particulars of which are governed by Regulation No 3649/92.
This Regulation also permits the use of an accompanying document for transport under a duty suspension arrangement, but on which it must be clearly indicated that it is a ‘simplified accompanying document for the purposes of fiscal control (products subject to excise duty)’.
The same rules governing the transport and admission of products placed in free circulation in another Member State apply in SR.
In those cases, the tax authorities transported the products put into free circulation with an accompanying document for transport under a conditional exemption scheme, the 3rd and 4th copies of which the beneficiary submitted to the SR tax authorities for verification.
Customs authorities in SR registered these services in the transport database under a conditional exemption scheme, as the accompanying documents did not indicate that they were a simplified accompanying document.
The SAO SR compared the transport database of the Czech Customs Administration with the transport database of the Slovak Customs Administration and found:
- in the databases, the quantity of products transported was reported inconsistently, e.g. mineral oil was given in litres, hectolitres or kilograms; alcohol was given in litres or litres of alcohol, making it difficult to compare the quantity of goods transported,
- the quantity of ethyl alcohol transported shown in the invoices did not tally with the quantity registered in the databases,
- not all related invoices were listed in the databases,
- two shipments of ethyl alcohol from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic made in November 2004 were registered in the Slovak customs database in a total volume of 47,237 litres of alcohol which were not in the Czech customs database.
The Slovak side handed over copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side.
5. International exchange of information between Czech Customs and Slovak Customs
Until 30 June 2005, Council Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxation of insurance premiums governed the conditions for cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the management of excise duties.
On 1 July 2005, Regulation No 2073/2004 entered into force, laying down rules and procedures enabling the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange the information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties.
Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office to ensure contacts with other Member States in the field of excise administration and be responsible for exchanging information on the movement of excise goods.
In the Czech Republic, an ‘Excise Liaison Office’ (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ELO of the Czech Republic’) was set up in DG C to ensure the exchange of information in the field of excise duties between the Member States of the European Union.
The security of tasks related to the management of systems to control the movement of goods subject to excise duties (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of information in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the SR was carried out with effect from 1 May 2004 by the ELO office of the customs office Poprad.
With effect from 1 July 2005, the tasks of the ELO office are carried out by the ELO (located in Poprada) of the Excise Duties Department of the Customs Directorate of SR (hereinafter referred to as ELO SR).
Under Article 3(3) of Regulation No 2073/2004, the central liaison office is responsible in particular for: - the exchange of data held in the SEED electronic register, - the Early Warning System Excise (EWSE), - requests for verification of movements of goods subject to excise duties sent to or received from other Member States by the Movement Verification System (MVS).
The content, scope and functions of the SEED, EWSE and ISA systems are governed by Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 2073/2004.
SEED - system for exchanging information on tax entities trading in excise goods.
The system is made up of national registers of excise payers and allows tax authorities in the territory of the European Union to ascertain whether products subject to excise duty are being traded by a person authorised to do so.
Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States only for excise purposes.
The central liaison office of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union are able to obtain confirmation of the information held in that database.
In accordance with Section 41 of Act No 98/2004 Z. z., with Section 39 of Act No 104/2004 Z. z., with Section 46 of Act No 105/2004 Z. z., with Section 40 of Act No 106/2004 Z. z and with Section 39 of Act No 107/2004 Z. z ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, beneficiaries and tax warehouses - the SEED database.
Customs offices in SR contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or beneficiary in the SysNed application software, which is automatically linked to ELO SR.
For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, beneficiary or tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, the related data is automatically transferred to the SEED database.
The SAO of the Slovak Republic found that the exchange of SEED databases between the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place generally once a month during the audited period, exceptionally several times a month.
SR Customs received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.
Data to the SEED database in the Czech Republic are transmitted from a national register in which all persons authorised to dispose of products subject to excise duty and issued authorisations to dispose of such products are registered.
Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international SEED database.
Customs requests for information from the SEED database of other member countries are obtained only through the ELO CR.
EWSE - An early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods, through which the transport of risky consignments is announced.
Transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits set by the European Commission regulation is considered to be a risky consignment and transport is assessed as a risky consignment by the tax authorities.
The exchange of information is carried out in two forms:
- information - to be sent when the limits laid down are exceeded,
- a warning message - is sent when the transport of goods is assessed as being at risk.
When assessing the risk level of a consignment, ELO SR uses the SEED database for sending a warning message, on the basis of which it checks the data contained in the accompanying document.
In the event that the data in the SEED database does not match the data in the accompanying document (for example, the registration number of the consignee of the goods or the residence of the consignee does not match), ELO SR shall draw up a warning message to be sent to the ELO of the Member State of the consignee of the goods.
ELO's reporting is governed by the Tax and Customs Commission Regulations CED 317 and CED 457, which, among other things, determine the type and quantity of goods in the respective units of measurement for information and warning reports.
During the audited period, ELO SR sent one warning message.
In the Czech Republic, information on shipments of products initiated in excess of the limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when approving the transport.
If, on the basis of its own analysis, the tax authorities in the Czech Republic assess the consignment as a risk, they will process a so-called warning message, which they will send to the relevant Member State via the ELO CR.
In 2005, ELO ČR sent two warning messages to ELO SR.
The ISA - the system for controlling the movement of goods - allows, through applications, the ISA to control the individual transport of excisable products as well as the control of the specified transport route between the entities mentioned in the accompanying document.
The exchange of information is based on a request in which the ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.
The system is mainly used in cases where the consignor takes a certified copy No 3 of the accompanying document and requests e.g. reimbursement of excise duty, and in cases where the data contained in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.
During the audited period, ELO SR sent 33 applications to ISAs.
ELO ČR sent 25 applications to ELO SR to MVS.
Customs authorities in the Czech Republic most often checked the information contained in the accompanying documents, in particular the quantity of products received and/or dispatched, or whether the consignor of products mentioned in the accompanying document was authorised to dispose of products subject to excise duty, if this could not be verified in the international SEED database.
Received ISA applications in both countries were forwarded to customs offices locally responsible for the consignee or consignor of excisable products.
The customs authorities checked the required data and notified the outcome of the investigation to the other member country via ELO.
6. Summary
The cooperation of the SAO-Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic made it possible to compare the basic legislation governing the field of excise duties in the two states, the procedure of the Customs Authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the opening and closing of the transport of products under the conditional exemption regime between the two states, the registration of these traffic, and to further compare the exchange of information between customs authorities in the framework of international cooperation.
6.1 Comparing the legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, differences were found:
(a) the procedure followed by the tax authorities and the tax authorities in commencing the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme.
The transport of products under the conditional exemption regime can only be initiated by a tax entity in the Czech Republic with the approval of the tax administration, which authorises the commencement of the transport on condition that the transported products have been provided with a tax guarantee equal to the tax attributable to them.
The commencement of the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme in SR is not subject to the authorisation of the tax authorities.
During the audited period, the taxpayer was required to notify the tax authorities of the start of the transport of ethyl alcohol and tobacco products.
He could start the transport of mineral oils, beer and wine without informing the tax authorities.
In 2006, amendments to all excise laws were progressively adopted in SR, under which the consignor of goods under a duty suspension arrangement is required to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office of local authority of the consignor before commencing transport;
(b) within the time limits for dispatching copy No 3 of the accompanying document.
The recipient in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copies No 3 and No 4 of the accompanying document to the tax authority for verification at the latest on the following working day after the transport is completed.
The certified copy No 3 shall be sent to the consignor at the latest on the following working day following receipt from the tax authorities.
The recipient in SR is required to send to the consignor of the products copy No 3 certified by the tax authorities and the consignee of the products no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.
6.2. Customs authorities in both SR and the Czech Republic keep an electronic register of shipments of products under the conditional exemption regime.
The content and method of keeping such records are not regulated by law in the Czech Republic or the Slovak Republic.
Customs authorities in both countries record all the data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport is carried out.
There is currently no single electronic system for monitoring the transport of goods under a duty suspension arrangement between the Member States of the European Union, allowing excise duty managers in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the transport of goods.
Under Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system to monitor the movement of excisable products is foreseen from 1 July 2009.
On the basis of the agreement on cooperation in control activities, the Czech side handed over to the Slovak side a database of the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme started in SR and terminated in the Czech Republic.
The database included 5,876 items relating to transported mineral oils, ethyl alcohol and tobacco products.
The Slovak side handed over to the Czech side a database of the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in SR.
The database included 3,319 items relating to transported mineral oils, ethyl alcohol and tobacco products.
The Czech side compared the data for shipments listed in the register of shipments initiated in the Czech Republic with the record of shipments terminated in the Slovak Republic.
The Slovak side compared data on the transport of goods under the conditional exemption regime initiated in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.
Data reconciliation was hampered by the fact that the quantities of goods being shipped were not uniformly reported in the databases.
In cases where it was not possible to clearly attribute data on individual traffic in the two registers, an examination of the accompanying documents was carried out and neither breaches of the conditional exemption scheme nor cases of tax evasion were found.
On the basis of the findings of the parallel controls, it can be concluded that Member States can obtain valuable information from the traffic register to improve the management of excise duties.
The setting up of an electronic system for the movement and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council will allow for the electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movements under suspension of excise duty within the territory of the European Union.
Communiqué
This report was prepared in Czech, English and Slovak.
The report was signed by the President of the Najvyšší Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic.
Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on follow-up results
Introduction Word
Taxes in general are a key source of public revenue.
It goes without saying that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) should focus their attention on this area.
Value added tax (VAT) fraud is an example.
In their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated each year in the European Union (EU).
As early as 2005, attendees of the VIth EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.
As part of this cooperation, SAIs can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.
VAT is a very suitable area for control cooperation as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also referred to as the SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, hereinafter also referred to as BRH) carried out the first parallel VAT control action in 2006.
The report was published in 2008.
As VAT fraud is not limited to a single country, but is widespread across the EU, close cooperation between the SAIs is needed to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the steps being taken to address the problem.
The two SAIs therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a follow-up parallel check.
1. Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of the audit: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration (D) Bilateral audit with the SAO (follow-up)
Target of control:
(CZ) The objective of the audit operation was to examine the VAT administration procedure of the tax authorities, in particular to verify the procedure for dealing with selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany"), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of the two countries in the framework of international cooperation.
(D) The audit action was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.
It was also intended to cover other areas related to VAT.
The resulting control findings were intended to compare with established good practice (if any).
The audited period was the years 2006 to 2008 and, where relevant, the period before and after, until the end of the auditing period.
2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
A follow-up inspection of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.
Suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions have been identified during previous parallel checks.
Some of them required further screening.
Based on the audit findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations on VAT administration.
The follow-up was carried out to evaluate the actions taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspected cases.
The audit further focused on e.g. selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of claims and the carrying out of VAT checks on large tax entities.
When reviewing the VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, the auditors made the following control findings:
1. Recommendations from previous check
• Recommendation 1: Payer registration conditions should be harmonised across the EU
In previous parallel controls, a comparison of VAT registration systems in the two countries identified differences.
As different ways of registering cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registering payers within the EU.
This recommendation has been made at EU level.
The proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003") called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including the database of VAT payers' tax identification numbers.
He also amended the common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The SAIs expected EU Member States to agree on adequate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.
However, the latest version of that document, agreed by the EU Member States under ECOFIN, no longer contains the issue.
Both SAIs regret that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
However, they continue to regard this intention as a relevant prevention tool in the fight against VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements
In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU states introduce a monthly reporting period to allow for more timely examination of intra-Community transaction values.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions reduces the reporting period for recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month.
In the Czech Republic this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented from 1 July 2010.
In Germany, the obligation to file recapitulative statements on a monthly basis was not introduced by the deadline in accordance with the applicable EU rules, while in the Czech Republic it was.
• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany with a view to making VIES data more reliable and considering linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.
Work is still ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level Based on the results of the previous control action, both SAIs agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches need to be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.
If this is not the case, the perpetrators of the fraudulent activity will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The audit found that our two Member States use different risk management systems, which have their strengths and weaknesses.
In this area, the SAO audited EUROCANET, which allows information exchange within the EU, while BRH concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.
2. Follow-up of selected intra-Community transaction cases
During the previous audit operation, business transactions were jointly examined where there were doubts about their execution or irregularities in the reporting of business transactions on tax returns or recapitulative statements by tax payers from both countries.
The two SAIs selected for follow-up nine cases involving intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
The checks carried out by the tax authorities of the respective countries have not been completed by the date of completion of our previous joint control action.
A follow-up action verified that most of the tax proceedings in relation to the specified selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany had been concluded and that adequate measures had been taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT assessments or avoidance of input tax refunds).
3. Control of selected cases of risky intra-community transactions
High-risk cases of intra-Community transactions by EU payers enrolled in EUROCANET were selected for the check.
EUROCANET is a tool for detecting risky taxpayers within the EU.
The participation of Member States in this scheme is voluntary.
The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant in the scheme if some Member States refuse active participation.
Due to the fact that the German tax administration was not involved in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, no information could be obtained on which suppliers with German VAT IDs were assessed as being at risk.
In the framework of the audit operation, the SAO found both cases of normal commercial transactions and cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent VAT activities.
Tax authorities have limited means of controlling risky transactions, particularly when it comes to missing traders, and mere physical examination of documents can make it difficult to prove any fraudulent behaviour to the taxpayer.
A similar situation for tax administrations arises when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intra-Community carousel shops.
In such cases, it would be appropriate to ensure greater co-operation between customs and financial authorities to identify goods and irregularities in transport documentation, as well as to monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the final consumer.
Germany, like some other countries, is hesitant to actively participate in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.
In Germany, other instruments are being used to detect at-risk taxpayers, which have so far proved successful for the German tax administration.
In this area, there is a need to communicate and exchange experiences between EU Member States.
The EU Council has reached a political consensus on the proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Its main innovation is the creation of the EUROFISC network.
The experience gained so far in using EUROCANET should underpin the creation of this new network to fight VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance for recovery of claims
In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States follow the same European legislation.
Therefore, the way in which applications for international recovery assistance are handled is identical in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The SAO and BRH compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not match.
Both SAIs find it useful to renegotiate the statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent mismatches.
Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, SAIs agree that reliable statistics should include more information on VAT.
It would probably be useful for the Commission to produce an analysis, based on more detailed statistics, to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.
In both SAIs' view, this means helping Member States with low recovery rates to be able to raise recovery rates to at least the EU average.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in the process.
5. Control of large tax entities
The SAIs analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control of large tax entities (VDS) in both countries.
In addition, they gathered information from tax administrations in the form of a questionnaire on areas that SAIs consider essential for the management of this issue.
The responses received clearly show that the situation in the two countries is developing differently.
The Czech Republic has a system in place to guide the selection of risk-prone cases, relying on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from tax checks carried out, balance sheet data and profit and loss accounts, etc.).
This ensures the effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.
The establishment of a dedicated financial office for the management of VDS is planned in 2012.
In Germany, a similar system does not yet exist, making it difficult to manage and analyse VAT controls in general.
Germany has so far concentrated more on selecting the individual cases in question, mainly on the basis of data from the VAT return and recapitulative statement.
The analysis of this data relies on various risk management components which will be strengthened.
3. Control Action Progress
3.1 Czech Republic Follow-up
The audit was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by Division II - the revenue department of the state budget and territorial departments IX. Plzeň, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.
The audited persons were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also referred to as the Czech Ministry of Finance) and 25 financial offices (hereinafter also referred to as the ‘FIU’): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ Brno in Břeclav, FÚ BrÚ Vary, FÚ VÚ in Domestic, FÚ BrÚFÚ FÚFÚFÚ in PraÚFÚFÚ KrÚFÚFÚ, FÚ ÚFÚFÚFÚ I and FÚFÚFÚFÚFÚ FÚ I8, FÚ
The audit conclusion from this audit action was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Conduct of the inspection operation in Germany
The audit was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the Indirect Taxation Control Unit and the personnel of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
Following the selection of a sample of cases, a number of Länder were notified of the mission of the inspection operation.
In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, a control event took place in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.
The tax files of the following tax authorities were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Tax Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-sever), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);
In addition, discussions took place with the fiscal authorities of Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-jih) and the finance directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
A report on the inspection findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions
In preparation for the parallel audit events, a meeting of representatives of the two audit institutions was held in September 2008 to discuss and identify topics of control.
Subsequently, in December 2008, the leaders of the two SAIs signed an agreement to cooperate in carrying out parallel controls.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the control teams informed each other of the initial results achieved in the course of preparing the inspection, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on a course of action.
The second meeting took place in Prague on 2-4 December 2009.
The review teams exchanged the findings collected so far and agreed on a timetable for compiling a joint report.
The two SAIs, in carrying out parallel control actions, decided to focus on: • a follow-up of the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • an examination of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not resolved during the previous parallel check; • an examination of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high risk; • a review of the tax administration's procedure in the area of international assistance for the recovery of VAT receivables; • tax controls of large companies.
A report on the results of the parallel control actions was prepared during a workshop in June 2010.
4. Control of VAT administration in selected areas
4.1 Evaluation of previous review recommendations
4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Payer registration conditions should be harmonised across the EU
Based on the results of the previous audit action, the SAO recommended the modification of the conditions of VAT registration and the introduction of a new rule for the cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.
The modified conditions should make it possible to reduce more effectively the risk of possible tax evasion in the collection of VAT.
In this context, it was found that in some cases the tax authorities did not use the power to cancel VAT registration to taxpayers who did not comply with the obligations under Act No 235/2004 Coll. on Value Added Tax (‘the VAT Act’).
The amendment of the provision to introduce the obligation for tax administrations to cancel the VAT registration of payers upon repeated non-submission of a VAT return has not yet been proposed by the Czech Ministry of Finance.
Under the VAT Act, the tax authority may revoke the registration of the taxpayer ‘ex officio’ in cases where: (a) the taxpayer has not, without giving notice of the reason to the tax authority, carried out a transaction for 12 consecutive months; (b) the taxpayer has failed to fulfil his obligations under this Act; (c) the taxpayer ceases to be a taxable person.
In a previous audit action, it was found that the legislation in force allowed the Tax Office for Threshold 1 to cancel VAT registration on 31 January of the following calendar year to so-called non-established payers who had not incurred any obligation to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.
Often, the FVO for Threshold 1 did not revoke these taxpayers' VAT registration, as the relevant provision provided an insufficient deadline for deregistration.
This problem was eliminated by amending the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.
The tax authorities shall be entitled to cancel the registration of the non-established taxpayer where the taxpayer has not supplied any goods or services subject to tax or exempt goods or services with a right to deduct VAT in the preceding calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements
In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU states introduce a one-month deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements.
The Council Directive reduces the reporting period for recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.
There is also a new obligation to file recapitulative statements in electronic form.
A summary report must also be made by the payer if the services for which the place of supply is determined in accordance with Paragraph 9(1) of the VAT Code are supplied to a person registered for tax in another Member State and the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the tax on those services.
This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of the service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative reports to achieve higher data reliability in VIES This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.
The Czech administration conducts comparisons of intra-Community transaction data reported in VAT returns and summary reports of Czech payers automated in the ADIS system.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level
Proper collection of VAT is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
Combating VAT fraud is therefore an area of priority concern and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this fight is evidenced, inter alia, by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to establish the difference between the eligible and the actual VAT collected in the 25 EU Member States (hereinafter referred to as the EU-25) during the period 2000-2006.
Based on an analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concludes that the estimated amount of loss of uncollected VAT for this period is between €90 and €113 billion, with an average of 12% of eligible VAT not collected annually in the EU-25.
For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18%.
In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action found that an effective risk management system could not be developed by just one Member State.
The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in every EU Member State.
Regarding the risk management system, the SAO carried out a check of EUROCANET, a system used to exchange information in the EU.
Cases of risky intra-Community transactions by EU tax payers included in EUROCANET were selected for the check (see Chapter 4.3).
The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved through the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should help to improve the cooperation of the responsible authorities into a form that allows fraud to be detected in its infancy.
This network should later also become an important source of information in risk assessment for intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7 October 200812, while setting out the basic principles that will guide the network.
The EUROFISC picture is the already functioning EUROCANET fast and selective information exchange system, developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.
The aim of this system is to detect risky business transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report produced the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Payer registration conditions should be harmonised across the EU
The German tax administration has set up a well-functioning system for registering taxpayers, based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance brought the scheme to the attention of the Commission in October 2007.
Improvements to the system are made on an ongoing basis.
Currently, the questionnaire data is electronically processed and will subsequently be used for the survey as part of risk management already during registration.
The Commission presented a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.
BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to safeguard the level of standards already achieved in this area in Germany.
Recommendation 2
Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements
A law on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted on 8 April 2010.
That law includes provisions for the monthly submission of recapitulative statements on intra-Community deliveries.
Those provisions took effect on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in order to achieve greater data reliability in VIES and consider linking the two VAT return and recapitulative reporting systems
A joint working group was set up, made up of staff from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The group has developed a strategy for automatically comparing data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
This strategy is still being discussed in the Länder.
Furthermore, the working group looked at a tool designed to optimise the control process for transactions in the internal market.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.
Germany is a participant in this exchange under the so-called Risk Management Platform.
The European Commission supported the idea of the platform and, following a written consultation on 18 October 2006, the establishment of the Risk Management Platform was added to the Fiscalis Action Plan 2006-2007.
The members of the platform are further divided into sub-groups that address individual topics such as: • risk management tools; • influencing behaviour; • evaluation; • updating the risk management guide.
Reports on the performance of these subgroups were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and the withdrawal of such registration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included an extension of existing databases within the EU, including the VAT payer tax identification number database.
It also regulated common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
For the time being, the issue of registration and de-registration has been left to the national legislation of EU Member States.
Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.
BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already achieved in Germany does not fall.
On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached a political agreement on that draft Regulation.
The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
Member States must implement national procedures and only have the obligation to inform the Committee on Administrative Cooperation about these procedures.
Both SAIs deplore the Commission's failure to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, as both SAIs view this measure as an important preventive element in the fight against VAT fraud.
They would therefore welcome further efforts from the Commission in this direction.
Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements
In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU states introduce a monthly reporting period, allowing for a more timely examination of intra-Community transaction values.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions reduces the reporting period for recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it took effect on 1 July 2010.
Germany has not introduced a monthly recapitulative reporting obligation according to a fixed calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in line with EU directives).
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve greater data reliability in VIES and consider linking the two VAT return and recapitulative statements systems
The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.
Work is ongoing so far and BRH will closely monitor further developments.
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.
The SAO carried out a check of EUROCANET, a system used to exchange information in the EU (see chapter 4.3).
BRH in this area concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.
4.2 Follow-up of selected intra-Community transaction cases
The previous audit operation jointly examined the execution of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution or inconsistencies in the way in which the payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions on their VAT returns or recapitulative statements.
The two audit institutions selected for follow-up nine cases involving intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, whose control by the tax administrations of the two countries had not been completed during a previous joint control action.
1.
The Czech payer purchased goods worth €22,686 from a German payer in the 1st quarter of 2005.
This acquisition of goods was not declared by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return because the German taxpayer did not have a VAT ID allocated to him during that period, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax authorities received information that, under the German VAT Act, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order for the intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.
A subsequent audit by the SAO found that, on the basis of a check carried out by the Czech tax authorities, the Czech taxpayer had filed a supplementary VAT return in which he declared the acquisition of the goods at that value and at the same time claimed the same amount of VAT deductible on that tax return.
2.
In the 4th quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to purchase EUR 12 561 worth of goods from the German payer.
The acquisition of those goods was denied by the Czech taxpayer and did not appear on his VAT return.
The German tax administration refused to cooperate at the request of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as the turnover of the transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.
As the Czech tax authorities did not obtain evidence, they terminated the inspection without finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.
A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax administration had received two spontaneous pieces of information from Germany under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer had invoiced the goods to Slovakia.
The Czech payer purchased the goods from the Slovak payer and listed this acquisition on the correct VAT return for the month of October 2004.
3)
In the 4th quarter of 2004, a Czech payer was to purchase a €48,500 passenger car from a German payer.
The acquisition of the goods in question was not declared by the Czech taxpayer.
This payer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004, so the tax authorities charged CZK 0 in VAT for that quarter.
On the basis of information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, in March 2007 the tax authorities invited the payer to submit an additional VAT return, but this was not submitted by the payer.
A subsequent check revealed that the tax administrator had carried out other acts in the tax procedure in 2007 which showed that the passenger car in question had been sold by the Czech taxpayer to a car dealership in the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax authorities issued a payment notice for the December 2004 tax year, by which they retrospectively assessed VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and their subsequent sale in the amount of CZK 295 379.
By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was cancelled with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.
In the absence of enforcement of the taxpayer's enforceable assets, the arrears appear to be irrecoverable.
4)
The Czech payer was to make deliveries of new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany during the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005 for a total value of EUR 198 167.
A response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 revealed that there was an open tax-criminal case against the German entity in Germany.
In a follow-up, BRH obtained information that, after the tax proceedings in Germany had been completed, it was demonstrably established that the German taxpayer had been integrated into fraudulent activities.
Intracomanial acquisitions of goods were taxed at a value of €182,424 (2004) and €369,690 (2005).
The SAO subsequently found that the Czech payer had been involved in carousel business with new means of transport.
On the basis of information from the German tax administration concerning the examination of the supply of goods, a VAT check was initiated with the Czech tax entity for the tax years April, May and June 2005.
On the basis of the inspection findings and information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information, the tax authorities additionally assessed VAT for the period May 2005 at CZK 703 031 and for the period June 2005 at CZK 726 551.
5.
Czech payer A was to purchase a machine worth a total of EUR 58 000 from a German payer in February 2005.
This German payer was due to deliver EUR 88 027 worth of machinery to Czech payer B in Q3 2004, but payer B denied this acquisition.
A subsequent audit by the SAO found that payer B had acquired the machine from a German company that had an organisational unit set up in the Czech Republic.
Czech payer A did not report the acquisition of goods from a German payer on his VAT return.
A reply from the German tax authorities to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German payer had not made an intra-Community supply of the machine worth EUR 58 000, but had made a delivery of the goods within the Czech Republic.
BRH subsequently found that, following a tax audit, the intra-Community supply of the machine had been reclassified as a domestic supply of the machine and the VAT exemption had been abolished.
6)
The German taxpayer was due to deliver EUR 11,600 worth of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.
The SAO's subsequent audit found that the Czech tax administration had assessed the submitted additional VAT return, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State, including the acquisition of goods at that value, was wrongly recorded.
BRH found that after receiving a response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax authorities corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and retrospectively assessed VAT worth EUR 1 600.
Further movement of goods in Germany and application of VAT in Germany are subject to tax control.
The German payer's summary report has not yet been corrected as only the payer who filed the recapitulative statement can make corrections to the recapitulative statements in Germany.
7)
The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as to whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The Czech tax authorities assessed the Czech taxpayer at CZK 0 after the tax procedure for the February 2005 tax year and told the German tax authorities that they could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer had been revoked in 2007 for non-compliance and the Czech tax administration sent the documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.
A subsequent check by BRH found that the German taxpayer had changed his residence and that the new locally competent tax authority had revoked the VAT exemption for the supply of the car in question to the Czech taxpayer on the basis of the inspection carried out.
The German taxpayer has not yet corrected the figures in the recapitulative statement and has lodged an appeal against the tax authority's decision.
8)
According to VIES data, the German taxpayer delivered goods totalling EUR 33 205 to the Czech taxpayer between the 3rd quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.
A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator was trying to determine the causes of the differences incurred by the Czech taxpayer in acquiring goods between Q3 2004 and Q1 2005.
The Czech taxpayer has repeatedly filed an additional VAT return for the first quarter of 2005.
The Czech Tax Administrator did not clarify the difference in the value of purchased goods amounting to CZK 134 273 for the period from Q3 2004 to Q1 2005, since, according to the Czech Tax Administrator, it was not possible to accurately capture the business transactions for each quarter and therefore the Tax Administrator accepted the submitted additional tax returns.
9)
The German taxpayer delivered EUR 46 854 worth of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
The Czech payer admitted intra-Community acquisitions of goods worth only EUR 14 856 over the same period.
The Czech tax authority verified the amount of supplies made in the framework of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total declared value of the supply of goods of EUR 31 998, a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer in the VAT return and the VIES data.
A subsequent audit by the SAO revealed that the Czech taxpayer had filed a supplementary VAT return for the July 2004 tax year only in January 2007, after many urges from the tax administration.
At the same time, in that tax return, the taxpayer exercised the right to deduct VAT, thus keeping the tax liability for that tax period unchanged.
A follow-up check verified that for selected cases of business transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most tax procedures were completed and that the tax authorities in both the Czech Republic and Germany took adequate measures (i.e. subsequently assessed VAT or prevented input tax refunds).
4.3 Checking selected cases of risky intra-community transactions
4.3.1 Czech Republic audit results
EUROCANET can be an important source of information for detecting risky entities within the Member State where the goods were acquired.
In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from the EUROCANET system was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with data on the acquirers.
Starting from the 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic sends data on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers to EUROCANET.
In the framework of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system have been selected for inspection.
These entities acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.
Relevant data from tax administrations from other Member States was captured in EUROCANET.
As the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, no information could be obtained to help establish whether suppliers with German VAT IDs were assessed by the German tax administration as risk subjects.
The audit revealed cases of normal commercial transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or VAT fraud.
Where applicable, tax administrations have made use of the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
For example:
• The tax authorities did not detect any suspicions of involvement in risky transactions when verifying the signal information.
The tax authorities keep track of such tax entities due to their inclusion in EUROCANET.
• During the verification of risky transactions, the tax authorities did not show any deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax base and VAT in the accounting records submitted, even though they found irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or revealed business relationships with suspicious or non-contact companies from other Member States.
• The verification of commercial transactions was complicated as some taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax authorities and could not be contacted.
Locally competent tax authorities have mostly screened the risky tax entities and risk transactions identified in the signals from EUROCANET.
Tax authorities have limited options when examining risky transactions, particularly in the context of the screening of missing traders , and it is difficult to prove fraudulent behaviour to the taxpayer from a physical check of documents alone.
Stricter VAT registration requirements and more flexible deregistration would help reduce missing trader fraud.
In the case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered to report fictitious intra-EU supplies of goods or to issue formally correct tax documents to payers who unduly draw deductions of input VAT on their basis.
In cases where there is a suspicion of involvement of tax entities in carousel transactions and other fraud, and where goods are imported and exported from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities.
Closer cooperation between these authorities would help in identifying goods and irregularities in shipping documentation, as well as in monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.
The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in EUROCANET was assessed by the European Parliament in late 2008 as a weakness of EUROFISC, which should be remedied by setting up a mandatory EUROFISC network.
4.3.2 Control results in Germany
BRH analysed the information available from the Federal Central Financial Office, which contained data from EUROCANET.
Those figures were the criterion for selecting six files of German taxpayers for inspection.
Like some other countries, Germany has refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.
Germany thus has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but only receives data from EUROCANET.
The justification for this position is contained in the following statement:.in the Government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public administrative) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.
There is currently no legal basis for breaching the applicable rules on the concealment of tax information.
In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such data are used by other Member States within EUROCANET. ‘17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been carrying out analyses of EUROCANET data and forwarding them to the tax authorities of the Länder in accordance with an agreed procedure.
The German tax authorities receive control information on the direct business relations of payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been enrolled in EUROCANET.
However, the German tax authorities receive no information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relationship with traders from other Member States who also have business relations with the German trader in question.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse to actively participate.
As a result, the control in the area had to be carried out in different ways.
However, the results did not reveal major differences in the detection of VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.
Both countries' tax administrations have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is essential to establish a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The EU Council has reached a political consensus on a proposal for a regulation whose main contribution lies in the establishment of EUROFISC.
Experience gained from using EUROCANET data should also become part of the envisaged network to fight VAT fraud.
Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.
On the other hand, cases brought before courts at national and European level show that a discussion between Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemptions in intra-Community transactions appears to be necessary.
4.4 Mutual assistance for recovery of claims
4.4.1 International recovery assistance in the Czech Republic
In particular, the following directives provide the basic framework for international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:
• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;
• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and customs duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;
• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
In the Czech Republic, Council Directive 76/308/EEC was implemented by Act No 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it was necessary to implement this Directive into the Czech legal order while amending the aforementioned Act No 252/2000 Coll.
In this context, a new Act No 191/2004 Coll. on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims was adopted.
The new regulation in the system for adjusting international cooperation for the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28.11.2008.
The annex to the regulation sets out new templates for applications to be used from 1.1.2009, the new obligation for electronic communication and the obligation for the requesting authority to certify the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.
Guiding principles for providing international recovery cooperation:
1. reciprocity;
2. assistance is always given only on request containing the prescribed elements;
3. assistance does not cover financial claims which have the nature of a criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. the provision of international recovery assistance shall be governed by the domestic law of the requesting State;
5. foreign claims do not have priority in enforcement;
6. assistance shall be provided only for the recovery of uncontested claims;
7. the principle of exhaustion (the requesting State has used, without success, all the available options to recover a claim under its legal system).
Act No 191/2004 Coll. defines three forms of assistance, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the actual recovery of claims.
Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States
The locally competent tax office shall electronically send a request for information, a request for delivery or a request for recovery of claims together with the relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the finance directorates.
The Czech Ministry of Finance will provide a translation of the request into the relevant language, scan it, including its attachments, and send it to the competent authority of the tax administration of the designated State via the CCN/CSI network.
There are two basic requirements for enforcement: the claim must be for more than €1,500 and must not be more than 5 years old.
If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse enforcement.
Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States
Upon receipt of a request from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of the request as soon as possible and no later than seven days.
If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal and indicate the specific provisions of the Directive it invokes.
Such communication shall be sent no later than three months after the date of acknowledgement of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance verifies that the application has all the elements required by law and should transmit the application without delay through the Finance Directorate to the local tax office for processing.
If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax authorities inter alia survey the debtor's assets, e.g. by obtaining land registry statements, checking bank accounts, verifying vehicle registration at the DMV, etc.
Six months after the date of acknowledgement of receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance should inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation carried out to obtain the requested information.
In the case of non-contact tax entities, where recovery is not possible, the applicant authority should also be informed.
Any sums recovered by the tax authorities shall be transferred to the requesting authority in CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.
It is not inconceivable that the Czech tax authorities collecting foreign claims will allow it to be waived or paid in instalments if the State requesting the recovery agrees to do so.
During the recovery period, the debtor is prescribed interest or penalty payments under Act No 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.
This interest or penalty is due to the State that requested the recovery.
In the case of accepted recovery requests, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit the application to the locally competent tax authorities on time, in particular in 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was found in the framework of international recovery assistance as well as in the case of applications received from tax administrations from the Czech Republic.
The audit action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not comply with Act No 191/2004 Coll. because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in the recovery within six months of the date when the receipt of the application was confirmed.
This situation has been improving since 2008.
Statistics
The Czech Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(4) of Act No 191/2004 Coll., shall compile statistics for the European Commission by 15 March each year, indicating the number of requests for information, delivery or recovery sent or received in the past year, indicating the amount of claims to which the requests relate.
The European Commission draws up a report on the state of recovery on the basis of supporting documents provided by all EU Member States, which it submits to the EU Council and the European Parliament.
The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated the statistical data due to an error in the recovered receivables item in 2008 by EUR 5,250,000 by stating the incorrect value of the recovered VAT receivable (this was a shift in the decimal point after converting the receivable from Czech crowns to a value in euros).
This error was subsequently reflected in European Commission statistics.
Information on mutual assistance, including recoveries, is given in the table below.
4.4.2 International recovery assistance in Germany
The legal authority for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In the interests of more accessible wording and better clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have already been substantially amended several times.
The provisions apply inter alia to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into national German law by the EC Act of 3 May 2003 on the collection of state taxes.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German fiscal code.
Article 117.2 of the Code stresses that tax authorities can provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities in force in national jurisdiction and on the basis of the EC Administrative Assistance Act.
Part Six of Germany's fiscal code (Articles 249-346) enshrines legal provisions governing the enforcement process.
In particular, the administrative operations of the tax authorities are governed by the instructions for execution and the instructions for enforcement.
The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with representatives of the Länder supreme tax authorities regarding the principles of administrative assistance in the assessment of taxes and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The general conditions for lodging requests for recovery are as follows:
• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (Sections 251 and 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).
• All available domestic means of recovery have been exhausted.
• Claims which are the subject of requests for recovery assistance must be definitive.
• No more than 5 years may elapse between the issue of an enforcement order or the date on which the claim comes into effect (i.e. is no longer subject to an appeal) and the date on which the applications are submitted.
• The total amount receivable must be more than EUR 1 500.
Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States
German requests for the recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the tax authorities' implementing departments to the relevant foreign office, such as the Czech CLO, via the intermediary office and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Further follow the Methodological Guideline on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery of Claims) of 19 January 2004.25 A working group of the Federal Government and the Land Governments is currently reviewing this methodological guideline in order to adapt it to the Recovery Directive.
Applications, including attachments, shall be submitted electronically by the Financial Conduct Authority to the Intermediate Authority.
This office checks the accuracy of the application in content and form.
If the request is not correct, it shall be returned to the relevant tax office.
If it meets all the requirements, it is referred to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then ensure the necessary communication with the relevant foreign office and will also provide a translation of the request.
Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery received from other Member States shall be registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and an acknowledgement of receipt shall be sent within 10 days.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office will check whether the formal requirements have been met.
The Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the intermediary office, which then forwards them to the competent tax authorities and monitors their processing.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.
If the request takes more than 6 months to process, the intermediate authority shall invite the submission of an interim report to be submitted in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/DG.
Once the formal and factual elements of the request have been checked, the implementing departments shall notify the enforcement method.
Any sums recovered must be transferred to the bank account specified in the application within one month of their receipt.
Statistics
Information on mutual assistance for recovery between Germany and the Czech Republic in 2006-2008 (as at 31.12.2008) can be found in the table below.
4.4.3 Recovery control, case studies
Under international cooperation, 21 requests for international recovery assistance between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for scrutiny.
Examination of 10 selected cases found, inter alia:
1.
On 20.10.2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany received a request for recovery of a VAT claim for the years 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3 883, or CZK 109 820, from a Czech taxpayer.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send a request for recovery to the tax authority until 26.2.2008.
In order to secure the enforced claim, the Czech tax administration established a mortgage on properties owned by a Czech tax entity.
Since it was not possible to pay the entire recovered debt by mortgaging the properties, a payment schedule was agreed with the Czech tax entity, with repayments of at least CZK 2 000 per month.
On 31.8.2009, information was sent to the German tax administration on the state of recovery, noting that as of 25.8.2009 this claim had been partially recovered in instalments of CZK 49 600.
This sum was sent to Germany and then another instalment of CZK 3 000 was sent to Germany on 28.8.2009.
2.
On 7.1.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax arrears from a Czech taxpayer who owed EUR 180 869, or CZK 4 434 915, in Germany for VAT and for income tax and related taxes.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax authority only on 27.11.2008.
The tax administrator, by examining the ownership of accounts with banks, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movables, found that the debtor did not own any enforceable assets.
Furthermore, the local investigation established that the debtor did not stay at the address of permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.
This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6.4.2009 and on 16.4.2009 the reply from the tax administration was sent to the German tax administration.
3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany on 21.11.2007 for recovery concerning tax arrears on turnover tax and accessories of the Czech tax entity amounting to EUR 3 139, or CZK 84 846.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for the recovery of this claim to the tax authorities on 6.8.2008, although on 18.2.2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance had received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the claim in Germany.
On 9.12.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax authorities that the recovery request was being processed by the payment of a claim by a Czech tax entity in Germany.
However, the claim in question was also recovered in the context of recovery in the Czech Republic and entered in Germany on 27.10.2008.
Due to the long time limits within which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the competent tax authorities, the claim was paid twice in this case - by the entity itself in Germany and by the Czech tax authorities recovering the claim.
In cooperation with BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been set off against a claim from a further recovery request of EUR 6 649 to be sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance records only a claim for recovery of EUR 3 139 with this company, a claim for recovery of EUR 6 649 does not appear in the Czech Ministry of Finance file with the company in question.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany to recover the tax arrears of a Czech taxpayer who owed EUR 39 957 in income tax and VAT and accessories in Germany, or CZK 956 654.
On 19.12.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the Czech tax authorities.
A recovery procedure was initiated on 1.6.2009, ordering the seizure of a claim on accounts with banks in the Czech Republic and of a salary deduction (the deduction amounted to CZK 7 000).
In his dealings with the tax authority, the debtor stated that he disagreed with the amount of the claim and considered it questionable.
The Czech tax administrator found that the taxpayer was willing to repay EUR 250 per month in the past, which was not accepted by the German tax administrator.
The tax entity has promised to discuss the application with the German tax administration with a view to obtaining a change in the amount of its claim.
The recovery of the debt was still ongoing during the audit operation.
5.
On 19.11.2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery request from Germany concerning a Czech taxpayer who owed CZK 3 116 304 in income tax for 2005 and turnover tax for the period 2003-2007 and accessories.
It was not until 14.11.2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the Tax Office for Prague 1, which is responsible for administering the tax to non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, as it was not possible to determine the locally competent tax authority on the basis of the address given by the tax entity.
During the FÚ investigation, it was informed that the debtor had an income of EUR 4 704 on 19.9.2008; however, the FÚ could no longer issue an enforcement order for that amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance did not transmit the request for recovery until after that date.
On 26.1.2009, the Czech tax administrator initiated enforcement of the claim and issued an execution order for the attachment of the claim to the debtor's funds in accounts held with banks and savings and credit unions.
The recovery of the debt was still ongoing during the audit operation.
6.
The Czech tax authority requested international cooperation in recovering the VAT claim and costs totalling CZK 146 223 742 on 3.10.2006.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send this request for recovery to the German tax administration until 13.5.2008.
On 8 September 2008, the German tax authorities transferred to the Czech authorities, through the Federal Bank, the sum received from the execution of funds in the debtor's account, amounting to EUR 17 700, or CZK 439 226.
An error in the recalculation of the amount recovered was found when verifying the volume of claims recovered.
The recovered amount of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at EUR 1 = CZK 25,065 erroneously to EUR 583 378.
The correct conversion of the amount recovered is EUR 5 833 781,83.
A request was therefore sent to Germany to recover the sum, which was lower by EUR 5 250 404.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance to recover a tax arrears with a Czech taxpayer who owed CZK 1 970 632 in VAT and accessories, or EUR 79 847.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send an application to the German tax administration until 10.11.2008.
On 4.2.2009, the German tax authorities called on the debtor to pay the arrears.
In view of the significant decreases in the company's turnover in the 2nd half of 2008 and in particular in the 1st half of 2009 and the related liquidation situation of the company, the following payments were made to cover the arrears: EUR 4 600 on 8.4.2009, EUR 3 000 on 6.5.2009 and EUR 2 500 on 16.6.2009.
These payments were sent to a tax administration account in the Czech Republic.
On 23.6.2009, the German tax authorities agreed with the debtor to pay a further instalment of EUR 2 500 by 30.6.2009.
8.
A claim for recovery totalling EUR 398 653, or CZK 9 832 779, including a claim for real estate transfer tax, was received from the Czech tax authorities to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2.10.2008.
On 3.4.2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a communication from the German tax administration that the application had been returned by the German tax administration.
The German tax administration justified the refund on the ground that the tax on the transfer of immovable property was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) or (h) of Council Directive 2008/55/EC.
The German tax administration further stated that Article 2(g) concerns claims in relation to income tax and wealth tax.
Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and on capital listed in Article 1(3) in conjunction with Article 1(4) of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed to draw up and submit a new request for recovery, excluding arrears of real estate transfer tax of CZK 61 759 and including arrears of VAT, corporation tax and personal income tax, which will be re-sent to the German tax administration.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has received a new request from the Czech tax administration for the recovery of tax arrears concerning the same taxpayer who owes CZK 7 079 735 in income tax and VAT.
9.
On 6.2.2006, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of tax arrears by a Czech taxpayer who owed CZK 3 445 782, or EUR 123 328, in personal income tax and VAT.
Of that amount, VAT was CZK 1 133 967.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the German tax administration until 18.04.2007.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech tax administration the reply from the German tax administration dated 9.7.2007 until 11.11.2008.
The reply stated that the German tax authorities had issued an enforcement order against the bank account with the bank on 11.6.2007, but it said that it had no business relations with the tax entity.
By doing so, the German tax authorities considered the application to be settled.
10.
On 26.9.2005, the Czech tax authorities sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of VAT arrears totalling CZK 1 296 845, or EUR 43 591.
The application from the Czech tax administration was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10.10.2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the German tax administration on 15.12.2005.
Before sending the request for recovery, the Czech tax administrator executed the execution on the debtor's funds in bank accounts and the payroll deduction and set up a lien on the immovable property.
The request for recovery was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authorities on 16.3.2005.
The reply to a request for information received by the Czech tax authorities on 16.9.2005 showed that the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income of EUR 8 437 from non-business activity.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery on 20.4.2006, but forwarded it to the Czech tax authorities only on 12.2.2008.
The reply stated that no recovery proceedings could be initiated in Germany because of the debtor's insolvency - no assets had been identified for him and his income from non-business activities was already subject to another enforcement procedure.
In doing so, the German tax administration considered the request for recovery to be completed.
4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation
In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States follow the same European legislation.
Therefore, the way in which applications for international recovery assistance are handled is identical in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The SAO and BRH compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not match.
In a 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay close attention to the management of their statistics.
In a 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of discrepancies in the statistics had decreased, even though the number of applications had increased.
Both SAIs consider it important that statistical issues are renegotiated at EU level.
This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent mismatches, otherwise the data reported by EU countries in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, both SAIs agree that reliable statistics are to show the annual number of claims as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amount of claims recovered by each Member State.
Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by Member States as this may assist Member States in assessing their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.
The fact that recovery rates per Member State can be calculated is considered useful by both SAIs for Member States with lower recovery rates to intensify their efforts and seek to improve recovery rates at least to the EU average.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in the process.
Especially in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for recovery on time to the locally competent tax authorities.
A similar situation was found for requests for international assistance received from tax administrations from the Czech Republic.
The audit action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance had failed to comply with Act No 191/2004 Coll. on International Assistance for Recovery of Claims because it had not informed the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in the recovery within six months of the date on which the application was confirmed to have been received.
4.5 Control of large tax entities
4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic
General information
The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.
The procedural procedure for the control of VDS is based on Act No 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons who were set up or set up for business purposes and whose net turnover for the tax period indicated in the income tax return for natural/legal persons amounted to CZK 2 billion or more.
The classification of the taxpayer as a VDS took place after the submission of the income tax return for the relevant tax year, for the first time for 2003.
A taxable person ceased to be known as VDS when, in three consecutive tax years from the end of the tax return under which he was included in the VDS, his net turnover for the tax year fell below that threshold.
A taxpayer could not be excluded from the VDS register without carrying out a tax check of at least one tax per tax year.
All VDS were checked at a minimum frequency of five years by the end of 2009.
From 2010 onwards, a written assessment of the taxpayer must be carried out at least every two years and the follow-up chosen must eliminate tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.
The FCA control is focused on at least one type of tax; tax authorities generally elect several tax years at the same time.
VDS were audited by the specialist inspection departments, which are set up in total for 13 FCs, or by the control departments of locally competent FCs.
The Specialised Inspections Unit carries out tax inspections within the remit set by the Director of the Finance Directorate.
In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines
• Tax entities operating in unusual and specific business sectors;
• Entities for which it is technically and time-consuming to carry out a tax audit;
• Entities with a sprawling territorial and organisational structure;
• Entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;
• Entities linked in chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified luring of excess deductions.
The number of tax inspections carried out by the specialised inspection units of the FCA and the results of those inspections are shown in Table 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed an amendment to Act No 531/1990 Coll. on Territorial Financial Authorities, which consists of the establishment of a specialised FÚ with nationwide coverage for selected tax entities (inter alia for corporate entities created for business purposes, which have achieved a turnover of more than CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany
General information
VAT controls on large companies are governed by the same rules as tax controls in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: • German Fiscal Code (AO), • Fiscal Governance Act (FVG), • Tax Control Regulations (BpO).
Other methodological documents are also in force.
German Fiscal Code
The statutory provisions on control are enshrined in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - Tax inspection on the spot. In particular, these articles lay down the rules governing the admissibility of on-the-spot tax checks (i.e. at the premises of the business), their scope in terms of subject matter, the rules governing the allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of the inspection notice, the principles of control, the duty of the taxpayer to cooperate and the conditions for carrying out the final discussion and the communication of the inspection report.
On-the-spot tax inspections are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).
Fiscal Governance Act Pursuant to Section 5.1, point 1, in conjunction with Section 19 of the Act, participation in on-the-spot tax inspections carried out by the tax authorities is compulsory for the Federal Central Tax Office.
The authorities involved will agree with each other on the spot the nature and extent of the Federal Central Tax Office's involvement in tax inspections.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that the particular undertakings it selects be subject to an inspection at a time to be determined by it.
In such a case, it may declare rules on the conduct and content of the inspection at the premises of such companies.
Rules on tax controls According to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the regulations on tax inspections (German acronym BpO 2000) were agreed by the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German Parliament in which the governments of the Länder are represented.
These administrative provisions apply to on-the-spot checks by the tax authorities of the Länder as well as by the Federal Central Tax Office.
Undertakings are classified by size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of the BpO 2000.
Large enterprises are subject to ex post control (Article 4.2 BpO).
Under Article 33.1 of the BpO 2000, any informed tax authority must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in the BpO 2000.
Methodological guidelines
In addition to the above, the additional methodology for tax administration provides the following guidance:
• A uniform manual for special VAT controls in Germany ;
• a USLO manual setting out the methodology for using intra-Community trade relations data conducted in VIES;
• the ZAUBER manual, which sets out the methodology for using the ZAUBER database;
• work aids for various and special items.
The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits according to the type of business.
The data are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
They are assessed every three years and fixed for the next three years.
The number of companies to inspect - not just large enterprises - must be determined at regular intervals.
As a general rule, inspections of large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.
Checks are usually announced including VAT checks.
This means that, in the course of the inspection, checks will be carried out definitively, in particular on income tax, excise duty and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.
VAT checks can be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.
Implementation varies and depends on the organisation of the Länder.
The number of tax periods covered by the checks is usually between three and five years.
BpO 2000 foresees a three-year control period.
All taxes on a given company are subject to verification.
4.5.3 Control management of large tax entities
Both SAIs chose not to examine individual cases of VDS checks carried out, but focused on management issues to get an overview of how tax administrations manage the issue of VAT controls at VDS.
By means of a questionnaire, they gathered information from tax authorities on areas they consider essential to the management of the issue.
• What statistical records and analyses, related to the VAT inspection of VDS, are available to the management of tax administrations?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or measurement records that distinguish between the fight against VAT fraud and, in general, VAT control?
Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow for such a distinction at the current data version.
Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between a check designed to combat VAT fraud and a general VAT check.
• Are there any statistics or a record of the timeliness of VAT checks (linked to the time period of transactions checked)?
Czech Republic: Records of timeliness of questioning relevant for intra-Community acquisition of goods on behalf of selected VAT payers are reported in the ADIS system.
In addition, the information registered in the ADIS system also includes data on how long the questioning took.
Germany: No, uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors contain only information on the average time of the last check (year information).
This figure does not provide an overview of selected control periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.
VAT inspectors focus on the most recent tax assessment period; also have the right to carry out VDS checks.
However, the statistics produced at Federal level for the special VAT control units do not provide information regarding the classification of tax entities.
• There are some statistics or records on the nature of the additional tax revenues generated, disaggregated for example according to the following criteria:
i. net increase in tax liability (e.g. in cases where the taxpayer has improperly applied a reduced rate of VAT instead of the standard rate of tax);
ii. only a nominal increase in tax liability (e.g. moving a fully qualified VAT case to another tax year);
iii. additional collection of tax revenue (payment of additional tax due).
Czech Republic:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the amounts of tax levied retrospectively broken down by type of tax, by the number of taxable entities audited and by the number of tax years audited.
Other tax practices (local inquiry, complaint procedure) are followed in the same way.
Timetables and amounts of additional taxes paid are recorded as a separate task.
General debt statistics broken down by type of tax, but not by declared tax or tax identified by the tax authorities, are also kept.
Germany: No, uniform statistics at Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not distinguish between the criteria listed.
In addition, most of the tax administrations visited do not distinguish between these differences.
• Are the control areas from which high additional revenues are generated recorded?
Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administration has the right to select the taxpayer for verification on the basis of criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special sections of ADIS.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
It follows that uniform stats at Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide such data.
Nevertheless, there is one coordinated approach by the finance ministers of the Länder and the federal government.
In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must record their increased tax (VAT) liability if they exceed a certain amount.
In that case, they must specify, for example, the nature of the tax increase imposed.
• What are the most common findings?
Czech Republic:
- VDS claims an unjustified right to deduct input tax on supplies and services:
• which have not been used to carry out any economic activity under Section 72(1) of the VAT Act;
• which have been used for representation under Section 75(3) of the VAT Act;
• on the basis of tax documents which did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73 (1) of the VAT Act;
- The VDS did not declare output VAT pursuant to Article 21(1) of the VAT Act.
Germany: It has been established that there are no regulations at Federal level.
It follows that uniform stats at Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide such data.
VAT findings are not recorded separately by the Länder if they result from VDS tax controls.
However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must enter their assessed increased tax (VAT) liability if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Revenue Office is able to analyse this information.
• Does the tax administration carry out analyses of areas of control from which there is a high "yield" and draw conclusions for management?
Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they are launching nationwide audits focused on risky commodities or the subject of economic activity.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Uniform Federal-level statisticians for Tax Controllers and Special VAT Inspection Units do not provide data on audit areas from which high "revenue" is generated.
There are differing views on the analysis process as well as on case management in terms of relevance.
Some regional tax authorities provide special information, but its use is at the discretion of the tax authorities.
4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation
Differences in the responses of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a wealth of data from the tax checks carried out, as well as data from the financial statements - balance sheets and profit and loss statements.
Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to guide the selection of risk-prone cases.
The same is true of the analysis and management of VAT control in general.
In 2012, it is planned to set up a dedicated financial office for the management of VDS in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.
It follows that those tasks are more difficult to perform in a similar manner.
Germany's philosophy, however, places greater emphasis on selecting individual cases based on data from submitted tax returns.
The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.
On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to assess the exact amount of VAT.
Both SAIs agree that Member States should be able to ensure adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.
This will help reduce shortfalls in VAT revenue.
As a result, it will increase the revenue from VAT collection and improve the level of risk detection among unreliable entrepreneurs.
5. Conclusion
The cooperation of the two SAIs on parallel controls of the VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and BRH.
The two SAIs got to know each other better about the systems in place in the following areas: • intra-Community transactions; • VAT risk management, in particular regarding the selection of risk-prone transactions; • Assistance to recover VAT claims; and • VAT control of large tax entities.
Cooperation between them has revealed differences in the strategies for detecting VAT fraud cases as well as differences in the above areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The control findings were compared and good practices were identified based on them.
In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will give a boost to stakeholders to start a discussion on approaches and strategies within Member States, including at European Commission level.
The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation between the two SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT administration.
