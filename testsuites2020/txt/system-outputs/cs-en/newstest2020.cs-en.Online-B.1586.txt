In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so revenues from value added tax affect not only the state budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.
The parallel inspections focused mainly on the control of the procedure of tax administrators in verifying the amount of value added tax paid in business transactions carried out between individual Member States of the European Union.
The introduction of the VIES system enabled the electronic exchange of information on the registration of value added tax payers in the individual Member States of the European Union and on the commercial transactions carried out by these payers.
The discrepancy between the data in the VIES system and the data in the value added tax return filed by the payer should alert the tax administrator to suspicious cases and enable the detection of tax evasion or under water.
The benefit of the performed parallel inspections consisted not only in the exchange of information on the progress of financial resp. tax authorities in the administration of value added tax, but in particular in verifying the use of the VIES system in controlling the exercise of the right to exemption from value added tax in intra-Community transactions.
The knowledge gained during the implementation of parallel inspections is beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in the implementation of other parallel inspections in cooperation with the inspection institutions of the Member States of the European Union.
Report on the results of parallel inspections of the value added tax administration for the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005
Introduction
Inspection number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005
Subject of control: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration, (SK) Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and fulfillment of tasks within the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU Member States
On 12 September 2005, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “SAO, CR”) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “SAO SR”) concluded an Agreement on Cooperation in Audit Activities.
The subject of the agreement was cooperation in parallel control actions "Value Added Tax Administration", included in the plan of control activities of the SAO, CR for 2005 under No. 05/19 and "Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and recovery of value added tax". and fulfillment of tasks within the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU member states ”, included in the SAO SR plan of control activities under No. 22/2005.
The parallel control actions had the character of a coordinated control.
The result of the joint coordinated inspection was processed in accordance with the European Implementing Regulation No. 31 for INTOSAI inspection standards.
The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information to the extent specified in the concluded contract and in the preparation of a joint final report on the result of parallel inspections.
The purpose of the coordinated inspection was to verify selected cases of delivery and acquisition of goods in suspicious business transactions between value added tax payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter "CR") and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter "SR").
Both parties have contractually agreed to provide each other with information from public sources, from the electronic system VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on received and sent requests to verify business transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
The inspections were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by the Department of the State Budget and the Territorial Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwestern Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The auditees were the Ministry of Finance and 12 tax offices: the Financial Office in Mladá Boleslav, the Financial Office in Kolín, the Financial Office in Teplice, the Financial Office in Karlovy Vary, the Financial Office in Tábor, the Financial Office in Brno III, the Financial Office in Znojmo, the Financial Office in Zlín, the Financial Office in Šumperk, the Financial Office Ostrava I, the Financial Office for Prague 7 and the Financial Office for Prague 9.
The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic was performed by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 9 selected tax offices: Bratislava I Tax Office, Komárno Tax Office, Trenčín Tax Office, Prievidza Tax Office, Zvolen Tax Office, Tax Office Dolný Kubín Office, Košice II Tax Office, Košice V Tax Office and Michalovce Tax Office.
Objective of inspections:
The aim of the parallel control actions was to check the progress of financial, resp. tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") after the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter "EU") and examine the use of electronic information system VIES, especially in monitoring the .
The audited period of the coordinated inspection was the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel inspections In the EU Member States, the electronic VIES system is in place, which allows tax administrations to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt taxable supplies from VAT and in the country of destination to verify that the purchaser duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.
VIES is not centralized within the EU, each Member State is developing its own system.
The inspection revealed differences in the national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the following areas:
The summary reports show the values ​​of deliveries of goods to other EU Member States, the values ​​of the services provided are not reported in the summary reports.
Data from summary reports submitted by Czech taxpayers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of tax authorities, where they are compared with data on deliveries of goods to other EU Member States stated in VAT tax returns.
The tax authorities transmit the data from the summary reports to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.
In the Slovak Republic, data from summary reports submitted by Slovak taxpayers at tax offices are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic (CLO).
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers report the value of supplies of goods and the value of services provided to other EU Member States on separate lines of VAT returns, which allows comparing the values ​​stated in summary reports with the values ​​of supplies of goods under VAT returns and identifying any differences.
In the Slovak Republic, the values ​​of goods and services supplied to other EU Member States are reported in aggregate on a common line of the VAT return.
As a result, in the Slovak Republic, the system does not allow automatic identification of differences between the values ​​of the supply of goods according to VAT tax returns and summary reports.
Separate reporting of the values ​​of supplies of goods in VAT tax returns makes it possible to use the results of comparing data when checking the exemption of supplies of goods to the EU from VAT.
Delivered data from summary reports submitted by payers in other EU member states are processed at CLO and compared with the value of acquisition of goods stated by payers from the Czech Republic, resp. SR in tax returns for VAT.
In the Slovak Republic, these data are sent to the tax authorities and the tax administrators themselves decide which cases of differences they will examine.
In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which quantified differences between the values ​​of deliveries and acquisitions of goods must be checked by the tax administrator, and forwards the list of these cases to the locally competent tax authorities.
This ensures that for the most significant deviations, it will be checked whether the VAT was declared in the correct amount when purchasing the goods.
The audit also drew attention to some problems in the VAT administration system of complications caused by different reporting of intra-Community transactions (ie supplies and acquisitions of goods by payers from different EU Member States):
Aggregate reports are submitted in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum deadline for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the respective quarter.
Reducing the period for which recapitulative statements are submitted to one month, together with shortening the processing time, would allow earlier access to VIES data.
Tax administrations would thus be able to verify more effectively whether VAT on intra-Community acquisitions was declared at the correct level.
At the same time, filing VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same tax period (month) would allow faster verification of whether the payer reported the same value of supplies of goods to the EU in both the recapitulative statement and the VAT return.
Differences between the values ​​of delivery of goods reported by payers from the EU and the values ​​of acquisition of goods reported by payers from the Czech Republic, resp. The Slovak Republic was caused, among other things, by different reporting of data on intra-Community supply and acquisition in individual EU Member States.
These included, for example, the inclusion of received advances in the recapitulative statements, or the reporting of intra-Community supplies in the supplier's recapitulative statement in a quarter other than intra-Community acquisitions in the acquirer's VAT return.
Unification of the conditions for reporting this data within the EU would lead to more efficient control activities of the tax administrations of individual Member States.
The cooperation between the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic was also focused on the examination of selected intra-Community transactions carried out between the two states.
A total of 40 cases of business transactions carried out between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax subjects were examined, in which there were doubts about their execution, resp. suspicion of VAT evasion.
The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR found the following facts, among others:
taxable persons have declared in their VAT returns for the purpose of unauthorized acquisition of an excessive VAT deduction the execution of intra-Community transactions which have not actually taken place;
the taxable persons reported intra-Community supplies in the context of carousel transactions, in which there was an intentional multiple reduction in the value of supplies in order to draw excessive VAT deductions;
suppliers reported in their VAT returns and recapitulative statements intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to purchasers who were so-called "lost companies" and did not declare tax on the goods acquired;
suppliers have made an intra-Community supply of VAT-exempt goods to taxable persons who have not been registered for VAT in another Member State.
In these cases, the supply should not be exempt from VAT and should be subject to tax in the supplier's country;
Suppliers reported intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns at a higher value than those reported by the purchasers in intra-Community acquisitions, with in some cases VAT being declared incorrectly.
The findings of the audit showed that VIES provides tax administrations with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.
In particular, tax administrations should pay increased attention to the thorough examination of differences between the data reported by VAT payers and the data in the VIES system and the use of all information in tax proceedings.

VIES system
In order to monitor the exercise of the right to VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies of goods, a VAT information exchange system has been set up within the EU.
It includes the electronic VIES system, which allows the tax administrations of the EU Member States to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt the taxable supply from VAT and, conversely, whether the acquirer duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.
The VIES information system is not centralized within the EU.
Each Member State is developing its own VIES system.
The national systems work on a common principle and are interconnected through the EU's common communication network, the so-called CCN (Common Communication Network; see diagram below).
In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was connected to the automated tax information system (hereinafter referred to as “ADIS”), in the Slovak Republic to the application software of the tax information system (hereinafter referred to as “APV DIS”).
These systems use financial, resp. tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in the administration of taxes and fees.
International administrative cooperation

In order to verify a certain intra-Community transaction or to obtain other information related to a specific tax entity, they send financial, resp. tax authorities through MF CLO, resp. DR CLO to EU requests for information.
Through these requests, they obtain information from the requested Member States which they can use for the correct assessment of VAT.
Requests for information are usually sent between the CLOs of the EU Member States in electronic form, using a standardized SCAC form.

The SAO SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent the DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out at the participating entities.
At the time of the coordinated inspection, the locally competent tax administrator carried out further investigations concerning the Czech entity in the Czech Republic, and at the same time an investigation was conducted by the Police of the Czech Republic.
O
The following 2 cases concern companies suspected of involvement in carousel fraud.

CZK and in the 1st quarter of 2005 in the amount of 21,935 thous. CZK.
The reply to this request for information received from the Slovak Republic showed that in the DAP for the month 12/2004 the Slovak payer No. 4 stated zero value of acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in the DAP for the months 1 and 2/2005 stated the value of acquisition of goods from another EU member state only in the amount of 1,193 thous. Sk.
The Slovak taxpayer No. 4 did not respond to the invitation to submit tax documents for the tax period of the months 10/2004 to 3/2005.
During a local investigation conducted in the Slovak Republic, it was found that the company is not located at the address specified in the Commercial Register.
The reply further stated that this payer met all the characteristics of a so-called "lost company" and therefore there was a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.
The SAO SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent the DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out at the participating tax entities.
During the coordinated inspection, the Czech tax administrator collected documents that would confirm or refute the existence of the goods.
VAT will be assessed according to the result of the survey.
The case is also being dealt with by the Police of the Czech Republic.
The course of the control action
As part of the preparation of parallel audits, a coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO SR took place in the first half of July 2005.
The participants of this meeting got acquainted with the legislation in the field of VAT in both countries and the integration of the electronic system VIES into national databases.
The result of the meeting was the specification of the scope of cooperation and the determination of the conditions for the selection of control samples.
Both parties agreed that the cooperation will focus on the following areas: a) verification of the validity and accuracy of the VAT number of persons registered for VAT in the Czech Republic, resp. SR in intra-community deliveries; b) verification of data on intra-community acquisitions specified in the DAP of the payer in the Czech Republic using information from summary reports (hereinafter referred to as “SH”) of payers from the Slovak Republic contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic on completed business transactions.
It was further agreed that the selection of tax subjects for inspection will be made in connection with the volume of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic via the SCAC form.
5.1 Intra-Community transactions
The procedure of information processing by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the case of intra-Community supply and acquisition of goods is illustrated in the following diagram.
5.1.1 Intra-Community delivery
If the VAT payer makes an intra-Community supply, he is obliged to submit a SH by the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.
The payer in the Czech Republic provides in the SH summary information on his deliveries of goods to another EU Member State exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.
The payer in the Slovak Republic is obliged to state in the SH the value of goods that were exempt from tax and delivered from the Czech Republic to other EU Member States during the calendar quarter.
Data on the value of delivered goods are always given in SH in Czech, resp. in Slovak currency broken down by individual tax subjects with the indication of their VAT number under which they were registered in their country.
Data on services are not entered in the SH.
If the payer in the Czech Republic finds out that he has provided incorrect data in the SH, he is obliged to submit subsequent SHs.
In the event that the payer in the SR finds out that the data stated in the SH were incomplete or incorrect, he shall submit a corrective SH before the expiry of the deadline for the submission of the SH, after the expiry of this period he is obliged to submit an additional SH.
The VIES system enables the exchange of information on the registration data of VAT payers in EU Member States.
Payers from the Czech Republic, resp. The Slovak Republic can verify whether the VAT number of the respective acquirer is registered in the given EU Member State.
Data from submitted SH are on MF CLO, resp. DR CLO system VIES grouped according to individual VAT number of acquirers.
The aggregate value of all deliveries for each VAT number of the acquirer and the code of the method of performance from all its Czech, resp. Slovak suppliers, so-called L1QD files.
The data from the L1QD files shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.
The total value of intra-community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic (from L1QD files) is shown in the following table.
If the VIES system in another Member State detects an erroneous VAT number of the acquirer in the sent L1QD files, it generates a so-called O_MCTL message, which contains all erroneous VAT numbers with the type of error.
This message is then sent to MF CLO, resp. DR CLO.
The O_MCTL message can contain 4 types of errors: formally incorrect VAT number, VAT number is not registered in the given state or was never assigned, the acquirer with a certain VAT number was not a VAT payer in the given quarter, VAT registration of the acquirer was terminated during the quarter.
In the Czech Republic, the MF CLO transmits data from received O_MCTL reports to tax authorities.
If the erroneous VAT number of the EU payer is used in one of the sent SH or subsequent SH lines, a so-called "VAT ID Doubt Notification" is generated at the relevant tax office by the ADIS system.
The tax office checks whether the supply has actually taken place to a VAT-registered payer in another EU Member State and records the result of the verification in the system.
In the Slovak Republic, the DR CLO processes all O_MCTL messages in the VIES system and sends them electronically to the locally competent tax authorities together with the identification of taxpayers who have entered an incorrect VAT number in their SH.
The tax authorities then invite the taxpayer to submit an additional SH and state the valid VAT number, resp. When reporting an invalid VAT number in the submitted SH, the tax office will check the delivery of the goods at the relevant payer.
Data on the number of erroneous VAT numbers relating to intra-Community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are given in the following table.
Of the total number of 41,728 VAT numbers of Czech payers listed in the SH of Slovak payers in the period from the 2nd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005, 929 VAT numbers were incorrect, ie 2.23%.
Of the total number of 62,997 VAT numbers of Slovak payers listed in the SH of Czech payers in the same period, 416 were incorrect VAT numbers, ie 0.66%.
When reporting intra-Community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, Czech VAT payers stated in their SH on average less erroneous VAT numbers than payers from the Slovak Republic.
When examining the activities of financial, resp. It was found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of taxable persons in all cases.
E.g.:
- although the VIES system confirmed the validity of the tax entity's registration in the 4th quarter of 2004 at the request of the tax administrator in the Czech Republic, an O_MCTL report was subsequently generated due to the termination of the payer's registration in this quarter.
The investigation revealed that the registration was terminated on 1 January 2005;
- The SAO SR also found that 6 tax subjects submitted SHs in which the incorrect VAT number was stated, but the O_MCTL reports did not contain this VAT number.
In the Slovak Republic, the filed SH will be transferred to the electronic form at electronic offices and the data from them will be sent to the CL CLO.
After the subsequent processing of these data in the VIES system, the DR CLO will send to the relevant tax authorities the so-called breakdowns of errors in the SH submitted by tax subjects for the relevant quarters.
The SAO SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH as of 26 July 2005 (ie data processed before the start of the inspection) and as of 2 February 2006 (ie data processed after the end of the inspection).
The following table compares the data.
From the above data it is evident that the SAO SR audit had an effect not only on the reduction of the number of SHs with incorrect VAT number (by an average of 199 SH per quarter), but also on the reduction of the number of uncorrected errors in SH (by an average of 431 errors per quarter).
In the Czech Republic, the value of intra-Community supplies stated by the payer in the relevant DAP lines is compared with the value of intra-Community supplies stated by this payer in the quarterly SH.
ADIS automatically indicates the differences between these values.
The tax administrator should examine the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the data obtained in determining the tax liability.
The SAO, CR found that the audited tax authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.
The total difference between the values ​​stated in SH and DAP in these cases amounted to 537,231 thousand. CZK.
From the 3rd quarter of 2004, the ADIS system enabled the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values ​​stated in SH and DAP in the amount of up to 0.5% of the total value of intra-community supplies according to SH as a conformity and set it in the ADIS system.
For payers with a large volume of intra-Community supplies in one quarter, 0.5% of the value represents a non-negligible amount, therefore tax administrators in these cases should not set the compliance of SH and DAP without clarifying the reasons for the differences.
E.g. the tax administrator set a match without verification in the event of a difference in values ​​in the amount of 1,561 thous. CZK.
The examination of differences in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was complicated by the fact that SH for each calendar quarter was submitted by payers within 25 days after the end of this quarter.
For taxpayers with a monthly tax period at the time of filing the DAP for the first two months of the calendar quarter, the tax administrators could not compare the values ​​of intra-Community supplies stated in these DAPs with the values ​​according to SH.
In these cases, the tax administrators learned of a possible discrepancy between the data in the DAP and SH only at the time when the tax liability or excessive deduction of VAT was assessed, or returned.
5.1.2 Intra-Community acquisitions
The VIES system provides, among other things, information on the values ​​of intra-Community transactions carried out within the EU Member States.
Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, delivered data from SH submitted by payers from other EU member states (delivered L1QD) are processed by MF CLO.
During processing, the data are converted at the minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared with the acquisition value stated by Czech payers in the DAP for the relevant quarter.
The value of the acquisition of goods reported by the payer in the DAP should be in the range of the minimum and maximum recalculated value L1QD (values ​​L1min and L1max).
If the value reported in the DAP is lower than the value of L1min, a so-called verification order is generated for the payer with the most significant discrepancies.
Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax subjects and are handed over to the locally competent tax authorities, which must investigate the transmitted data.
The number of verification orders concerning audited financial authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the following table.
The SAO, CR found that the audited tax authorities did not verify inconsistencies in the values ​​of intra-Community acquisitions in 33 cases, to which the received verification orders pointed.
The total difference between the values ​​stated in the SH of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers in these cases amounted to at least 148,319 thousand CZK. CZK.
The SAO, CR selected 533 files of tax entities for inspection, for which the audited financial authorities received an order from the Ministry of Finance of the CLO for verification.
The inspection revealed the following most common causes of differences between the values ​​stated in the acquirer's DAP and in the supplier's SH: on the acquirer's side (Czech payer) in 263 cases the acquirer did not state the acquisition of goods in the regular DAP in 6 cases the acquirer stated the value of the acquired goods in the wrong line of the DAP, on the part of the supplier (EU payer) in 88 cases EU payers also included in their SH the values ​​of services provided to the Czech payer, of which in 54 cases it was a payer from the Slovak Republic, in 39 cases suppliers included in SH the delivery of goods in a different tax period than acquirers from the Czech Republic to their DAP, in 22 cases suppliers stated incorrect SH Czech VAT number in SH, in 16 cases suppliers stated incorrect values ​​of goods delivery in SH , in 12 cases the suppliers included in the SH the value of goods delivered to the Czech Republic before 1 May 2004, in 5 cases the suppliers included in the SH the value received ch advances.
On the part of payers from the Slovak Republic, the value of provided services was most often incorrectly included in the SH.
54 such cases were detected at the audited tax authorities.
E.g. during the investigation of the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of 10,974 thous. CZK arose from the fact that the Slovak payer introduced to the SH for the 1st quarter of 2005 the provision of services (construction work and delivery of goods, including assembly in the Czech Republic).
Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values ​​of received advances in SH, eg 2 Slovak payers stated in SH received advances from Czech payers, as a result of which an order was generated to verify the difference in the amount of 3,580 thousand. CZK.
Orders to verify the acquired goods are generated only once per quarter.
In cases where there is subsequently a change in the data from the SH in the EU member states, such as a change in the customer of goods in the Czech Republic or an increased value of delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new verification orders are not generated.
As VIES does not automatically draw attention to these changes, the locally competent tax administrator of the acquirer of the goods does not have to know without any other incentive the facts decisive for the correct assessment of the tax liability on the acquired goods and there is a high probability of VAT evasion.
An inspection of the SAO, the Czech Republic revealed that this situation occurred, for example, in the following cases:
The Slovak payer stated in the SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004 the value of the delivery of goods for the Czech payer in the amount of 1,504,000 CZK. Sk.
On 1 February 2005, the tax office locally competent to the Czech payer sent a request for information to the Slovak Republic, because the Czech payer acknowledged the acquisition of goods only in the amount of 425 thousand CZK. CZK.
Based on the tax proceedings, the Slovak taxpayer filed an additional SH on March 1, 2005, in which he corrected the data on the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, by reducing the value of the delivery for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538 thousand. Sk and by increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from the amount of 194 thous. Sk to the value of 1 160 thous. Sk.
In their SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004, four Slovak payers stated intra - Community deliveries to payers from the Czech Republic in the total amount of 10,240,000 CZK. SKK (ie CZK 8,183 thousand).
However, the Czech acquirers did not report intra-community acquisitions in the DAP.
Based on the international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer who was not listed in the SH submitted by the Slovak payer.
During the 1st quarter of 2005, Slovak payers increased the value of intra - Community supplies for this Czech payer by a total of 10,240,000 CZK in additional SH related to the 2nd quarter of 2004. Sk.
In view of the above, the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the accuracy of the data in the submitted DAP for the 2nd quarter of 2004, even though the actual acquirer did not fulfill the obligation to declare intra-Community acquisitions for this quarter.
The SAO, CR found that on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the above-mentioned Czech taxpayer was additionally assessed VAT for tax periods 5 and 6/2004 in the amount of 3,640,000 CZK. CZK and for the 3rd quarter of 2004 in the amount of 3,305 thous. CZK from acquired goods in these periods.
From the above, it is clear that tax administrations had to examine in tax proceedings not only differences caused by errors in the acquirer's DAP, but also differences caused by different reporting of data on intra-Community supply and acquisition in individual EU Member States.
Unification of the conditions for reporting these data would lead to more efficient control activities of tax administrators.
Acquisition of goods in the Slovak Republic
In the Slovak Republic, the APV DIS system makes it possible to compare data on the value of acquired goods obtained through the VIES system from other EU Member States with data specified in the DAP of Slovak acquirers.
The method by which the data is compared is called the "MIN-MAX method".
Using this method, the values ​​of deliveries of goods listed in the SH of payers from other EU Member States are converted by the minimum and maximum exchange rates for the relevant quarter.
The MIN-MAX interval will be created, which is used for comparison with the acquisition values ​​of goods stated in the DAP of Slovak payers.
DR CLO will send tax administrators information on the values ​​of intra-Community acquisitions stated in the DAP and the values ​​of deliveries from the EU in the VIES system.
The tax administrator will decide for which VAT registered persons the difference will be verified, taking into account other criteria of the risk analysis.
Based on data provided by DR CLO, the SAO SR selected 57 files of Slovak purchasers of goods for inspection at the inspected tax offices, of which 25 payers also purchased goods from the Czech Republic, for which the highest differences were found between acquisition values ​​obtained from VIES and values ​​declared in DAP.
The SAO SR's inspection confirmed the fact that the tax administrators did not consistently verify the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and thus did not verify the accuracy of the data provided in the DAP of Slovak acquirers.
As part of the audit, the SAO SR asked the tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations at specific tax entities.
During the audit of the SAO SR at the tax authorities, 31 local investigations were completed.
For Slovak companies, for which the VIES system showed significant differences in MIN-MAX values ​​when acquiring goods from EU member states, the following facts were found, among other things:
In the DAP for the 4th quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer did not state the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.
The Tax Office found out that the company from the Czech Republic had incorrectly entered the VAT number of this payer in the SH for the 4th quarter of 2004, while the goods in the value of 19,184 thous. CZK in fact delivered to another Slovak payer.
According to the VIES system, in the 4th quarter of 2004 the Slovak company was to acquire goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the amount of MIN 682,692 thousand CZK. Sk and MAX 715 105 ths. Sk.
This company filed a DAP for the given periods, in which it stated the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU in the amount of only 480,599 thousand. Sk.
The tax administrator conducted a local investigation, finding that the tax entity purchased electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.
Suppliers to SH and DAP did not indicate intra-Community deliveries according to the date of issue of invoices, but according to the date of delivery.
Due to other irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU countries, the tax administrator will request a verification of the value of the delivered goods via SCAC forms.
The acquisition of goods from EU member states in the 4th quarter of 2004 was not reported by the Slovak payer in the DAP.
According to the VIES system, this payer had to acquire goods worth MIN 11 286 thousand. Sk and MAX 11 845 thous. Sk.
The tax office conducted a local investigation, the inspection showed that the tax entity did not acquire any goods from EU member states in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The SAO SR recommended that the tax office request an inspection of the supply of goods from EU member states via the SCAC form.
The VIES system reported the delivery of goods for a Slovak customer in the amount of MIN 557 thousand. Sk and MAX 565 ths. Sk.
In the DAP for the tax period of months 10 to 12/2004, the payer did not report any acquisition of goods.
Through a local investigation, the tax administrator found out that on 10 December 2004 the tax entity received an invoice from a supplier from the Czech Republic for the material consumed during the repair of the hydraulic loader.
The SAO SR recommended performing a tax audit of the payer.
During the audit of the SAO SR in 16 cases, the tax authorities did not complete the local investigation.
In 10 cases, the SAO SR requested the tax administrator to carry out a tax audit of tax subjects.
Reports on the results of local investigations and tax audits are submitted by the tax authorities after their implementation by the SAO SR.
These were, for example, the following cases:
The Slovak acquirer did not state in the DAP for the 4th quarter of 2004 the acquisition of goods from EU member states and for the tax period of months 10 to 12/2004 it did not declare any tax and claimed a refund of excess VAT deduction in the total amount of 1,236 thousand. Sk.
The tax administrator conducted a local investigation, which showed that the tax entity purchased goods from the Czech Republic in the amount of 683 thousand. EUR (approx. SKK 27,080 thousand).
The mentioned goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to the customs office in Čierna nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.
The Slovak payer issued an invoice for customers in the Russian Federation in the amount of 683 thousand. EUR, which he did not state in the submitted DAP.
The tax administrator performs a tax audit of the tax subject.
The difference between the data on acquisitions stated in the DAP of the Slovak payer for the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005 and the data on deliveries reported by payers from EU member states in individual quarters was in the total amount of 4,800,000 CZK. Sk.
The tax office found that the tax entity purchased goods from suppliers from the Czech Republic and Belgium and subsequently sold these goods to Ukraine.
The invoices were accompanied by export single customs declarations.
The acquisition of goods in the DAP was not reported by the tax subject; according to the company's managing director, the goods were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine in the transit regime.
The taxable person did not submit any VAT records during the local investigation.
A tax audit was initiated at the payer.
5.2 International exchange of L3 level information
The exchange of information at the L3 level is initiated by the locally competent tax administrators, who send their requests for information (hereinafter referred to as “FIFG”) or spontaneous information (hereinafter referred to as “SPI”) relating to a specific tax entity or transaction via MF CLO, resp. .
DR CLO to another EU member state. The aim of the ŽOI is, for example, to prove the execution of a given transaction within the framework of intra-community services, verification of a certain VAT number, etc.
In the case of SPI, this is the communication of information important to tax administrators in another EU member state.
Cooperation in the field of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The maximum time limit for replying to the SOI was set in Article 8 of this Regulation at 3 months.
The conditions for the admissibility of applications are governed by the Decision of the Commission of the European Communities of 15 November 2004, which stipulates that, unless the participating States agree otherwise, the FDI must cover commercial transactions of at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.
If the ŽOI concerns a commercial transaction with a value of less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may refuse to reply in view of its workload.
The procedure of processing incoming ZOIs by the Tax Administration of the Czech Republic, including the indication of internal time limits set for processing at individual organizational levels, is shown in the following diagram.
In the Slovak Republic, the deadline for the settlement of ZOI by the tax authorities was set internally at 2 months so that the three-month deadline pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 could be met.
From 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005, the MF CLO received a total of 29 ŽOI and 3 SPI from the Slovak Republic.
Of the 29 accepted ŽOI, 26 (ie 89.7%) were settled within the set period of 3 months and 3 (ie 10.3%) were settled after this period.
In the same period, the DR CLO from the Czech Republic received a total of 71 ŽOI and 7 SPI.
Of the 71 accepted ŽOI, 64 (ie 90.1%) were settled within the set period of 3 months, 5 (ie 7.0%) were settled after this period (in the remaining 2 cases it was not possible to determine the settlement period from the submitted materials).
More detailed data on the processing time of ŽOI received by MF CLO, resp. DR CLO contains the following graph.
The reasons for sending ŽOI, stated on the SCAC forms, are given in the following table.
Conclusion
International cooperation examined compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and the use of VIES for the exchange of information between EU Member States, in particular in monitoring the exercise of the right to VAT exemption.
International cooperation made it possible to examine selected intra-Community transactions carried out between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
Examination of selected transactions revealed that, based on the international exchange of information, the tax administrations of both countries revealed cases of companies making fictitious intra-Community business transactions to obtain excessive VAT deductions, as well as cases where purchasers did not declare VAT correctly.
The audit also revealed differences in the processing and use of data from the VIES system by the tax administrations of both countries.
The audit also pointed to problems caused by different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions of goods in different EU Member States.
Unification of the conditions for reporting these data within the EU would lead to more efficient control activities of the tax administrations of individual Member States.
By checking the financial procedure, resp. tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of the VIES system, it was found that the financial resp. the tax authorities did not make sufficient use of all the possibilities of the VIES system and the relevant legal authorizations.
Furthermore, it was found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on supplies of goods and on the validity of VAT registration of taxable persons in all cases.
The SAO SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH, processed before the start of the inspection, with data processed after the end of the inspection.
From the comparison of these data, it was clear that the SAO SR's inspection had an effect not only on reducing the number of SHs with incorrectly stated VAT numbers, but also on reducing the number of uncorrected errors in the SHs.
In the event of discrepancies in the reported data, the SAO SR requested the tax authorities to carry out local investigations, or to carry out tax audits.
The SAO, CR did not have such a possibility within the valid legal regulation in the Czech Republic.
The findings of the audits showed that the VIES system provided tax administrations with the basic information necessary to control the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.
Given that there is still room for tax evasion in this area, increased attention needs to be paid to intra-Community transactions in the administration of VAT.
Communique
This report was prepared in Czech, English and Slovak and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Chairman of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic.
Parallel control of the administration of value added tax and excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Foreword
This information material provides an overview of the course and results of parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the area of ​​value added and excise duty administration.
The co - operation between the supreme audit institutions of the two countries was carried out on the basis of an agreement on co - operation in control activities concluded in February 2004.
The topic of parallel audits was chosen in view of the fact that indirect taxes contribute significantly to the revenues of the state budgets of both countries.
The construction of value added tax, enabling the refund of the excessive deduction, provides scope for tax fraud, resp. leaks.
High rates of excise duties, especially on tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, mean high profits for those who escape taxation by selling these goods illegally.
Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.
Due to the need to address this issue comprehensively throughout the European Union, the VAT Working Group was created by the supreme audit institutions of the member states of the European Union, in the activities of which the supreme audit institutions of both countries are also actively involved.
The greatest benefit of the inspections carried out can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but especially in the joint effort to identify problem areas in the administration of indirect taxes in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion.
The experience and knowledge gained will be used in the planned controls of indirect taxes, focused primarily on the involvement of tax administrations of both countries in the VIES system, which allows to control the movement of goods between the Member States of the European Union.
Report on the results of the control of the administration of value added tax and excise duties for the period of 2002 and 2003
1. Introduction
Inspection number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004
Subject of inspection:
(CZ) Value added tax and excise duties
(SK) Control of the procedure of the tax administrator in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and excise duties
On 11.2. In 2004, an Agreement on Cooperation in Audit Activities was concluded between the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the "SAO") and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "SAO SR"). The subject of the agreement was cooperation in parallel inspections "Value Added Tax and Excise Duties", included in the SAO's plan of control activities for 2004 under No. 04/07 and "Control of the procedure of the tax administrator in the administration, control and recovery of value added tax". and excise duties ", included in the plan of control activities of the SAO SR under No. 18/2004.
The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information to the extent specified in the concluded contract and in the preparation of a joint final report on the result of inspections.
In the contract, both parties undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, the customs administration database and the files of tax entities kept by tax authorities in the Czech Republic and tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the parties could not obtain taxes on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the State concerned.
The inspections were carried out in parallel between January and August 2004.
In the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "Czech Republic"), the inspection was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of South Bohemia, North-East Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.

The aim of international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic and their subsequent verification in tax returns on the relevant financial, resp. tax authorities.
The audited periods were 2002 and 2003.
2. Recapitulation of control results
2.1. General evaluation of control activities
As part of international cooperation, the SAO handed over 22,206 items of single customs declarations (hereinafter referred to as "SAD") on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and the SAO SR handed over 30,221 SAD items from the Slovak customs database.
A comparison of selected SAD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic was performed.
Out of 5,883 selected SAD items from the Czech customs database, a total of 43% of related SAD items were assigned.
Out of 12,343 selected SAD items from the customs database of the Slovak Republic, a total of 26% of related SAD items were assigned.
Based on unallocated items, the SAD was on the financial, respectively. The tax authorities selected the files of tax entities for which the reported imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
On the basis of the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and financial, resp. In the territory of the other state, the realization of reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified.
The SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic performed a joint pilot inspection at the Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma border customs crossing, during which both parties cooperated closely in verifying the accuracy of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
The inspection did not reveal any deficiencies in the records of selected cases of imports and exports of goods carried out in 2002.
International cooperation enabled the examination of trade transactions carried out between trading partners from both countries and pointed to shortcomings in the records of imports and exports.
2.2. Summary of inspection results
The audit of the SAO and the SAO SR in the area of ​​international cooperation focused on imports and exports of alcohol and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, or other types of goods.
Based on the control of files of tax subjects on selected financial, resp. The SAO asked the SAOs to verify the implementation of exports of goods reported at 40 SADs in the total statistical value of CZK 15,301,093 and the SAO of the Slovak Republic to verify the exports in the statistical value of SKK 56,989.
The SAO and the SAO SR found out, among other things, the following facts:
- trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic,
- the error rate in entering data into the customs databases made it impossible to identify some imports, resp. exports,
- for some exports from the Czech Republic, corresponding imports to the Slovak Republic were not proven.
In these cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of unduly applying VAT deductions,
- the taxable persons did not comply with certain statutory obligations when reporting imports and exports in value added tax returns,
- in financial activities, resp. shortcomings were identified in the administration of value added tax and excise duties and in their cooperation with customs offices.
In the area of ​​value added tax and excise duties, attention will continue to be paid to international trade in order to effectively minimize tax evasion.
It is especially important to improve the activities of tax administrators in the performance of value added tax administration.
The basis of effective control of excise duties is the control of the circulation of documents, systematic physical control of goods and mutual exchange of information during the import and export of goods.
3. Description of the situation in the field of value added tax and excise duties
Value added tax
Value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") was levied by the tax or tax authorities on taxable transactions carried out in the country and by the customs authorities on the import of goods.
Tax revenues were for financial, resp. tax authorities due to the difference between the collected own tax liability and the refunded excess VAT deductions.
VAT revenues at customs offices were given by the amount of tax collected by them.
In accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, the tax collected by the customs authorities was reflected in the tax deductions applied to the financial, resp. tax authorities.
For most financial, resp. excessive deductions of VAT exceeded the tax liability of tax authorities.
In terms of state budget revenues, VAT is one of the key taxes, as it accounted for approximately 31% of the Czech state budget revenues in 2003 and approximately 42% of the Slovak state budget revenues.
The total VAT collection in the Czech Republic in 2003 amounted to CZK 162.9 billion.
In 2003, the tax and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT and the refunded excess VAT deductions totaled CZK 231.4 billion.
The total VAT collection in the Slovak Republic in 2003 amounted to SKK 83.8 billion.
In 2003, the tax and customs authorities collected SKK 187.0 billion for VAT, and the refunded excess VAT deductions totaled SKK 103.2 billion.
Excise duties
The collection of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as "SpD") was carried out by the relevant financial, resp. tax authorities and, in the case of imports of products subject to SPD, customs authorities.
The share of SpD in the tax revenues of the state budget in the Czech Republic in 2003 was approximately 16% and in the Slovak Republic approximately 19%.
The total collection of SpD collected in the Czech Republic by financial and customs authorities in 2003 amounted to CZK 85.6 billion and in the Slovak Republic reached SKK 38.0 billion.
4. The course of the control action
The cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR took place in two stages.
In the first stage, a comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was performed;
4.1.
Preparation of control action
The first proposal for cooperation in parallel inspections of VAT and SpD was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the SAO and the SAO SR in April 2003.
A coordination meeting took place in November 2003, at which, among other things, the selection of commodities was agreed - types of goods that posed a significant risk of compliance with customs and tax regulations: - alcohol and spirits, tariff items 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products , tariff headings Nos. 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, tariff headings and subheadings Nos 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile telephones and their accessories, tariff subheadings 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.
Both parties agreed that the selection of tax subjects for control will be made: a) from unallocated items determined by comparing exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, b) from entities carrying out imports and exports regularly or once in large volumes, c) based on findings from inspections carried out by selected financial and tax authorities.
4.2. Comparison of customs databases in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
In the first stage, the mechanism of mutual allocation of SAD items registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was tested on a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities in October 2002.
Subsequently, a part of exports from the Czech Republic was compared with imports to the Slovak Republic in 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:
- 2207 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol or higher; ethyl alcohol and other spirits, denatured, of any strength,
- 2208 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol; spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages,
- 2401 Unmanufactured tobacco; tobacco waste,
- 2402 Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes, of tobacco or of tobacco substitutes,
- 2403 Other manufactured tobacco and manufactured tobacco substitutes; homogenized or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and essences (essences),
- 8525 20 91 Transmitting apparatus incorporating receiving equipment: For the cellular network (mobile telephones),
- 8525 20 99 Transmitting apparatus incorporating receiving equipment: Other,
- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with the apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.
Other: Parts of apparatus falling within subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.
SAD items from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were assigned to each other on the basis of compliance of individual SAD paragraphs (eg invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration number of the vehicle transporting cargo, date of crossing the state border, tariff item, etc.).
The results of the comparison are shown in the following tables and graphs.
The mutual allocation of individual imports and exports was hampered, among other things, by the fact that trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides.
For example, exports from the Czech Republic declared on one export SAD were declared on several import SADs in the territory of the Slovak Republic, or the export SAD had a different number of items from the import SAD.
Other factors that influenced the success of the assignment were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, as well as the time shift between the records of exports in the customs database of one country and the records of corresponding imports in the customs database of another country.
The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples for the audited financial, resp. tax authorities.
Priority was given to certain tax entities that carried out imports, resp. exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, which could not be identified in both databases.
Furthermore, for the verification of business transactions reported in VAT tax returns, some tax entities were selected for which data on imports, resp. exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were found in both databases.
4.3. Pilot control at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing
The border customs crossing for the performance of pilot control was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unallocated SAD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
Based on a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, the use of checklists was introduced at the border customs crossings between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic on 1 June 1998.
The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as much as possible, to ensure an overview of the movement of means of transport transporting goods of a commercial nature in the customs area and to create conditions for mutual comparison of customs records.
The joint pilot inspection took place from 8 March 2004 to 26 March 2004 and was aimed at verifying this system of customs control.
Procedure for using checklists at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing:
1) Weighing the vehicle, issuing a checklist and handing it over to the driver.
2) Parking the vehicle in the marked sector in the parking lot.
Customs hearing in the check-in hall of the Police of the Czech Republic, the Police of the Slovak Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.
The individual check-in was confirmed by the individual components by imprinting a stamp on the checklist.
3) Delivery of the vehicle to the physical inspection area.
Submission of a control sheet, SAD, or other documents to a customs administration employee - control of the performance of all prescribed acts and documents.
Perform a physical inspection by the appropriate components.
Release of the vehicle from the customs area.
Note: When importing goods into the Czech Republic, the weighing of the vehicle was performed directly by employees of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
When importing goods into the Slovak Republic, the weighing of the vehicle was performed by employees of an authorized legal entity.
The vehicles were recorded in the computer records after consideration.
4.3.1 Control sample
Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic
The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the customs database of exports of the Czech Republic in 2002.
The composition of the control sample for exports is given in Table 4.
4.3.2. Checklists and their records Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic
When exporting from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these checklists in the electronic export database.
From the number of 453 SAD items, the SAO SR traced 256 cases of imports into the SR according to data from the customs database of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The remaining 197 items of the SAD were identified by the SAO SR in cooperation with the staff of the Drietoma border customs crossing.
Exports from Slovakia to the Czech Republic
When exporting from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
Out of the total number of 339 SAD items of the selected control sample, the SAO, in cooperation with the staff of the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov, assigned the corresponding registration numbers of control sheets to 295 SAD items.
The remaining 44 cases were identified in their records by Drietoma border customs officers and confirmed the export of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic.
The audit of the SAO and the SAO SR did not find deficiencies in the records of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing.
4.4. Selected audit findings when verifying business transactions
Within the framework of international cooperation, the implementation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified from the documents of customs administrations and financial, resp. tax authorities in the territory of the other state.
The following was verified for selected tax subjects:
- whether the submitted SADs were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic,
- fulfillment of the legal conditions for the application of the VAT deduction on importation, refund of the excessive VAT deduction and application of the VAT exemption on exportation.
Verification of business transactions revealed:
1. The SAO SR requested verification of the implementation of alcohol exports in the statistical value of SKK 56,989.
The SAO identified in the customs database of the Czech Republic the corresponding imports in the statistical value of CZK 42,624
2. A company engaged in the import and export of photographic equipment and accessories claimed an excessive VAT deduction of CZK 3,740,664 in its VAT return for the month of December 2002.
In order to control reported exports from the Czech Republic, the SAO collected 3 SADs (16 items) with a statistical value of CZK 1,274,822.
The SAO SR identified 3 corresponding import SADs (17 items) with a statistical value of SKK 1,724,321.
VAT was paid in the Slovak Republic to the relevant customs office.
3. In 2002, a company whose object of business was mainly the trade in optical instruments claimed a total excess VAT deduction of CZK 4,136,000 higher than the tax liability.
To verify the reported business activity, the SAO selected an export SAD (32 items) with a statistical value of CZK 7,154,124.
The SAO SR found that this SAD corresponds to the import SAD (12 items) with a statistical value of SKK 9,653,827.
VAT was paid in the Slovak Republic to the relevant customs office.
4. The company dealing, inter alia, with the purchase of goods for resale and resale, did not report any exports of goods in the VAT and tax returns submitted in 2002 and 2003.
According to the Czech customs database, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 totaled CZK 3,439,888.
Based on these facts, the SAO selected 5 export SADs (5 items) for verification with a total statistical value of CZK 669,839.
The SAO SR identified 5 corresponding import SADs (5 items) in the statistical value of SKK 1,012,656.
The SAO SR's inspection at the relevant tax office proved that the declared imports and the payment of VAT had taken place.
5. The company, whose object of business was, inter alia, the purchase of goods for resale and the sale, manufacture, installation and repair of electrical machinery and apparatus, reported in 2002 in VAT tax returns the export of goods in the amount of CZK 12,966,706.
According to the Czech customs database, the total value of exports in 2002 was CZK 14,474,381.
The SAO submitted 17 export SADs (59 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,975,122.
The SAO SR identified 13 SADs (50 items) in the customs database of the SR in the statistical value of SKK 3,621,370.
The customs database of the Slovak Republic failed to identify the corresponding import SAD for 4 export SADs (9 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 399,776.
The relevant tax office in the Slovak Republic verified these imports with the tax subject.
The tax entity listed on the SAD as an importer in the Slovak Republic stated in the minutes of the local investigation that it did not realize the imports declared on the Czech export SADs.
The SAO SR therefore asked the local competent tax office to carry out a tax audit of VAT and corporate income tax for the 2002 and 2003 tax periods.
6. According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, a company engaged in the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco labels in 2002 with a statistical value of CZK 7,338,199 and in 2003 with a statistical value of CZK 12,228,545.
In 2002 and 2003, the company did not report any exports in its VAT returns.
The SAO selected 5 export SADs (5 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,471,598 for verification.
For 4 export SADs (4 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,246,860, the SAO SR identified 7 SADs (7 items) with a statistical value of SKK 2,919,514 in the customs database of the Slovak Republic.
In the customs database of the Slovak Republic, it was not possible to assign the corresponding import to the export SAD (1 item) in the statistical value of CZK 224,738.
7. The software company did not report exports of goods in the 2002 and 2003 VAT returns.
According to the Czech customs database, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 and 2003 totaled CZK 1,630,198.
The SAO selected 9 SADs (9 items) for verification in the SR in the total statistical value of CZK 755,588.
In the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic, the SAO SR identified 8 SADs (8 items) with a statistical value of SKK 915,601.
Corresponding imports could not be assigned to the export SAD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 68,286 in the customs database of the Slovak Republic.
In the above cases, it was not possible to identify in the customs database of the Slovak Republic the corresponding imports to 6 SADs in the statistical value of CZK 692,800.
Of which:
- for 2 export SADs from the customs database of the Czech Republic in the statistical value of CZK 293,024, it was not possible to identify the corresponding import SADs in the customs database of the Slovak Republic (see points 6 and 7).
Due to a certain error in entering data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some registered imports, eg in cases where the importer's name was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number (hereinafter "VAT number").
Therefore, it cannot be stated with certainty that these exports did not take place.
- for 4 export SADs from the customs database of the Czech Republic, imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic in the statistical value of CZK 399,776 were not proven (see point 5).
In these cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious export of goods for the purpose of unauthorized application of the VAT deduction.
5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services within the control of selected financial, resp. tax authorities
5.1. Control sample
In order to verify the fulfillment of the obligations of tax subjects in the import and export of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the financial and customs authorities, the audited financial, resp. files of tax subjects are selected by the tax authorities according to the following criteria:
1. tax subjects were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic: a) with the highest volume of imports, b) with the highest amount of assessed VAT, c) with the highest volume of exports,
2. from the records of financial, resp. tax authorities were selected by the tax authorities according to the above: a) applied VAT deductions on import, b) applied excessive VAT deductions, c) the right to a refund of the SPD, d) applied exemption from VAT on export,
3. tax entities for which a tax audit has been performed.
The selection of the sample was made regardless of the country of destination, focusing on risky commodities.
5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic
An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is given in the following table:
5.2.1. Inspection of a selected sample at tax offices
At the audited financial authorities, the SAO focused mainly on:
- the procedure of the tax authorities in verifying the correctness of the VAT declared,
- cooperation between tax authorities and the customs administration,
- comparison of data from the customs database with the SAD database at tax offices with a focus on the comparison of the declared value, application of the correct VAT rate in connection with the customs classification of goods or services, or comparison of data on the SAD and attached invoices with data in the customs database,
- comparison of data from VAT tax returns on completed and received transactions from abroad with data in the SAD database at tax offices or in the customs database,
- the method of verifying entitlement to the VAT exemption for the export of goods or the provision of services abroad,
- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services provided reported in VAT returns with data from the customs database.
The SAD database at tax offices only contained records on those imports and exports for which tax subjects were obliged to state imports or exports in the tax return.
The files of tax subjects were examined at the audited tax offices, which reported in the tax returns for VAT in 2002 and 2003 imports in the total amount of 60,396,379 thousand CZK. CZK and the corresponding VAT in the total amount of 12,644,052 thous. CZK.
Furthermore, the files of tax subjects reporting exports in the tax returns for the years 2002 and 2003 in the total value of 47,323,111 thousand CZK were checked. CZK.
According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, tax entities in which imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were inspected in 2002 and 2003 carried out imports into the Czech Republic from the Slovak Republic with a total VAT base of 3,759,352 thousand CZK. CZK, VAT in the amount of 767 607 thous. CZK and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of 1,989,090 thous. CZK.
The detected differences between the records in the SAD database at the tax authorities and in the customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:
- SAD items that were missing in the Czech customs database were requested directly from the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,
- for SAD items that were missing from the tax office database, it was verified that they were not canceled documents,
- for SAD items for which different values ​​were found between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of tax authorities, the relevant SAD was requested at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic in writing, including the attached invoices.
During the examination, it was found that the SAD database at tax offices did not contain, for example, records on import SADs in the total value of VAT of 3,622 thousand CZK. CZK and records on export SADs in the total statistical value of 9,359 thous. CZK.
5.2.1.1. Identified differences
A comparison of the SAD database at tax offices and the cumulative tax obligations for 2002 and 2003 in VAT returns for a selected sample of tax entities revealed the following differences:
The differences in values ​​were mainly caused by:
- The time lag between the realization of imports and the exercise of the right to deduct VAT assessed on the import of goods.
The tax subject could claim the right to deduct tax on the import of goods within 3 years from the end of the tax period in which the goods were released into the relevant regime, respectively. in the case of a temporary importation scheme, no later than 3 years from the end of the tax period in which the scheme was terminated.
- The time lag between the realization of the export and the moment when the tax subject received the SAD.
The taxable person was obliged to state data on realized exports exempted from the obligation to apply output tax in the VAT return at the earliest for the tax period in which the goods left the country, if he also had a tax document, which was the SAD.
- Failure of taxpayers to fulfill their obligations when reporting imports and exports in VAT tax returns.
In some cases, taxable persons did not provide correct data on imports and exports in their VAT returns.
Due to the fact that tax subjects did not have to attach SAD lists to the submitted VAT tax returns, it was difficult for the tax authorities to control the right to deduct VAT or exemption from VAT.
5.2.2. Cooperation between financial and customs authorities
During the period under review, import or export duties and VAT were repaid or remitted on the basis of a decision of the customs authorities.
Tax entities were obliged by law to reduce the previously claimed right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax refunded by the customs office, in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.
No legislation regulated the sending of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs offices to tax offices.
Some audited tax offices received this information, but irregularly or with a significant time lag, and only from some customs offices.
One audited tax office did not receive this information at all.
If the tax office did not receive information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the data needed to check compliance with the legal obligation of tax entities.
In 2002, the customs authorities refunded VAT in the amount of more than CZK 319 million and in 2003 in the amount of over CZK 398 million.
The results of the audit pointed to persistent shortcomings in the activities of tax administrators, some systemic errors in the cooperation of tax authorities with customs authorities and non-compliance with certain obligations of taxpayers filing tax returns for VAT and SpD.
Weaknesses were identified in the administration of VAT and SpD, especially in the following areas:
a) upon cancellation of VAT registrations, the fulfillment of the payers' obligation to pay VAT on commercial property registered or which should have been registered on the day of cancellation of the registration, for which the payer claimed tax deduction, was verified only sporadically,
(b) the tax authorities have not consistently exercised the possibility to carry out a tax audit or a local investigation.
In some cases, this led to insufficient verification of the legitimacy of the right to deduct VAT,
c) the official records and minutes of the oral proceedings did not contain all the necessary information to substantiate the excessive VAT deductions applied,
(d) the tax authorities did not sufficiently verify the imports and exports reported in the VAT returns.
5.3. Control findings in the SR
5.3.1. Inspection of a selected sample at tax offices
For a selected sample, the SAO SR verified or the tax office performed a tax audit for the tax periods of 2002 and 2003.
After analyzing the submitted tax returns and applications for tax refunds at selected tax entities, the SAO SR requested the tax office to provide the relevant SADs documenting imports and exports, invoices and documents for tax payment.
Subsequently, the SAO SR checked whether the submitted SADs are registered in the customs database of imports and exports and fulfillment of decisive facts and legal conditions when applying the input tax deduction for import, when refunding excessive VAT deduction, when applying exemption from export tax and when refunding SpD.
The SAO SR verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the SR and the CR at 10 audited tax offices in the structure according to the number of SAD items and the sum of statistical values ​​given in the following table.
In total, imports in the statistical value of SKK 856.2 million were checked, which represents 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic to the SRO.
Exports of selected commodities were checked in the total statistical value of SKK 176 million, which represents 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white goods, packaging technology and software) from EU countries to the Slovak Republic were inspected in the total statistical value of SKK 532.8 million.
5.3.2. Cooperation between tax and customs authorities
During its inspection at the tax authorities, the SAO SR found discrepancies between the data registered in the customs database of the Slovak Republic and the data reported in specific VAT tax returns, eg:
- 2 tax subjects (natural persons) stated in tax returns imports of goods in the total value of SKK 1,589,261, on the basis of which they claimed the right to a refund of excessive VAT deductions.
During local investigations carried out at the initiative of the SAO SR, the tax subjects were unable to prove to the tax office the legitimacy of the application of input tax with the relevant documents on the implementation of imports and payment of VAT,
- the tax subject (s. r. o.) declared in the tax return for the tax period January 2003 the received taxable performance in the amount of SKK 77,167,576, the export of goods in the amount of SKK 18,006,041 and claimed an excessive VAT deduction in the amount of SKK 17,157,101.
The VAT tax returns filed for 2003 show that the difference between the volume of purchases and exports in the amount of SKK 59,161,535, which arose in January 2003, was not settled throughout 2003.
In the above-mentioned cases, the SAO SR requested the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the applied excessive VAT deductions.
- in another case, a tax entity (s. r. o.) for the tax period January to June 2002 stated in VAT tax returns the export of goods in the total value of SKK 87,199.
Verification in the customs database of the Slovak Republic revealed that the tax entity carried out exports in the mentioned period in the statistical value of SKK 296,747.
The tax office conducted several local inquiries at the company 's headquarters, finding that the company' s managing director (a UK citizen) had traveled and the company had left the leased premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.
At the time of the SAO SR's inspection, the tax administrator submitted a notification to the authorities involved in criminal proceedings on suspicion of committing a criminal offense of non-payment of tax.
Based on the results of inspections at selected tax offices, the SAO SR states that the biggest problems in the performance of administration and control of VAT and SpD occurred mainly in the following areas:
- non-use of the possibility to carry out VAT tax audits of problematic tax subjects, especially in cases of application of a high value of excessive VAT deductions,
- the tax audit reports did not contain a list of audited documents
- SAD for imports and exports of goods,
- insufficient verification of reported imports and exports of goods in tax returns,
- lengthy proceedings of tax administrations in issuing decisions, especially in the context of assessment proceedings, also with the consequence of the expiry of the right to impose sanctions,
- non-compliance with legal conditions in the provision of tax deferrals,
- non-compensation of VAT arrears within the period for refunding the excess VAT deduction,
- insufficient use of all forms of security and enforcement of tax arrears.
Based on the inspection of the identified deficiencies, the SAO SR requested the relevant tax authorities to perform a VAT tax audit focusing on the justification of the applied excessive VAT deductions for 14 tax entities.
Measures were taken at all audited tax offices to eliminate the deficiencies identified during the inspection, the fulfillment of which will be monitored and controlled by the SAO SR.
6. Conclusion
International cooperation enabled the examination of trade transactions carried out between trading partners from both countries and pointed to shortcomings in the records of imports and exports.
The result of the inspections was also the finding of persistent deficiencies in the fulfillment of obligations of VAT and SpD payers, in financial activities, resp. tax authorities, in a system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs administrations, which ultimately reduced the efficiency and effectiveness of tax controls.
The findings also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have at their disposal basic data on imports and exports from the customs database of the Czech Republic within the tax information system. In the Slovak Republic, there is no similar system for transmitting information on imports and exports of goods between the customs and tax administration.
The procedure for verifying the performance of the VAT and SpD administration was not the same due to different legal regulations and conditions in the territory of both states.
The SAO verified the necessary data from information obtained from the customs administration of the Czech Republic and from documents available at the audited financial offices. The SAO SR verified the execution of business transactions from the documents of tax subjects requested through the tax authorities.
If irregularities were found, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax audits.
The parallel inspections carried out in the area of ​​VAT and SPD assessed the state of administration of these taxes in the period before accession to the European Union and pointed to the need for further cooperation in this area.
Mutual cooperation will be further deepened in the control of financial activities, resp. tax authorities in connection with the adoption of the new VAT law.
One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of a so-called summary report.
This declaration must be submitted by all VAT payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.
Tax administrators are obliged to enter data from summary reports into the VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) system, to which tax administrators from the Member States of the European Union have access.
Financial, resp. the tax authorities then have the opportunity to compare these data with the data stated in the submitted VAT tax returns.
This system is also used to verify the validity of the VAT number of persons registered for VAT, to verify the legitimacy of the applied VAT exemption when delivering goods to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.
The implementation of parallel audits showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR.
The results of these inspections will be confronted with the outputs of the planned inspections, which will, among other things, focus on examining the VIES system, which is intended to prevent tax evasion in so-called "intra-Community supplies".
Given the importance of VAT and SPD for budget revenues, control activities need to focus primarily on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion on indirect taxes.

Report on the results of inspections in asylum facilities in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic
State property and financial resources intended to ensure the activities of the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior
Inspection Action No. 04/23 "State property and financial resources intended for securing the activities of the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior"
Inspection Action No. 15/2004 "Control of the management of state property and funds intended for the provision of asylum and temporary refuge to foreigners in the Slovak Republic"
1. Introduction
Population migration is one of the phenomena that have a global character and have become an integral part of the current development stages of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
It is mainly due to the flight of citizens from their country of origin or last permanent residence from persecution, in particular for racial, religious, national, political, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.
Their goal is to obtain asylum and integration into society, especially in some of the developed democratic countries in Europe.
A large group also includes foreigners whose reason for migration is unfavorable economic and living conditions.
Migration is not a new phenomenon.
The establishment of specific principles for aid to refugees has already led to the adoption of the 1951 Geneva Agreement and the 1967 New York Protocol on the Status of Refugees, which the governments of the signatory countries have undertaken to apply in their foreign policy orientations.
The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.
After the split in 1993, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to comply with the adopted international documents and confirmed their binding nature within the framework of national legislation by a legal act.
Both republics have enshrined the provision of asylum in their constitutional laws.
Parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic focused on the asylum process and related issues, the results of which are contained in the joint final report.
The co - operation between the supreme audit institutions of the two countries was carried out on the basis of the "Agreement on Co - operation in Control Activities" (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement") concluded in April 2004.
In the Treaty, both parties undertook to provide each other with information on the legislation governing asylum procedures in the other Contracting Party, selected statistics on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.
The aim of the parallel control action was to identify the same problem areas and to point out the consequences that follow from this for the area of ​​population migration.
The co-operation consisted in the unification of the program of control actions, in the exchange of information to the extent stipulated by the Treaty and in the preparation of a joint final report on the result of controls.
At the first joint meeting, which took place on 5.4. to 7.4.2004, identical areas of audited issues and control procedures in the preparation of audits were determined.
At the second meeting, which took place on 28.6. to 30.6. 2004, common points for the control program were specified.
At the third joint meeting, which took place during the inspection on 8.11. to 10.11.2004, there was an exchange of experience from ongoing inspections.
The forms of outputs from inspections were specified and the structure and content of the joint final report, which was prepared on 14.2. to 17.2. 2005 at the last joint meeting.
The inspections were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.
In the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by inspectors of the Department of Defense and Security and selected territorial departments.
The inspected persons were the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the "MoI") and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the "SUZ").
In the Slovak Republic, the inspection was carried out by the Defense, Interior and State Offices Section.
The audited entity was the Migration Office of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "MA").
The audited period was 2001, 2002, 2003 (hereinafter the audited period).
In some cases, statistics for a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.
2. Recapitulation of control results
2.1. Evaluation of control activities
The subject of the parallel inspections was: - asylum process, - asylum facilities, - management of financial resources and state property, - internal control system.
The mutual exchange of experience gained between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic took place in the phase of preparation and implementation of audits.
This exchange made it possible to more thoroughly evaluate the submitted documents, to analyze the causes of the identified differences in the provision of the asylum process.
Thus, it was possible to focus on the crucial problems affecting the operation of asylum facilities.
Ultimately, this had a positive effect on the quality of control activities.
2.2 Summary of inspection results
The harmonization of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with the documents of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the "EU") was the subject of evaluation reports of the European Commission on the readiness of both countries to join the EU.
The adoption of legislation in this area continues after the accession of both countries to the EU with the aim of further harmonization with EU law.
The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has a constantly growing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security to asylum seekers in accordance with international agreements.
The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditures drawn from the state budget of both countries is influenced mainly by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the granting or non-granting of asylum, and also the health status of the applicants.
The amount of some selected benefits is comparable in both countries.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of participants in asylum proceedings.
During the stay of asylum facilities, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, meals, health care and basic material equipment and hygiene needs.
At the same time, courses are organized as part of leisure activities and conditions are created for applicants for cultural and sports activities.
Asylum facilities include reception centers and residence centers, and in the Czech Republic also integration centers.
The cost per day depends on the occupancy and facilities of the center and is comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilized.
In the Slovak Republic, it is expected to increase by almost 1,000 jobs in the next two years.
The aim is to create the conditions for applicants, the growing number of which is expected to continue in the coming years in connection with the application of the Dublin Convention.
In the Czech Republic, the highest part of approved budget expenditures was spent on the provision of services. The decisive expenditures of this item were expenditures on accommodation and meals for applicants in asylum facilities operated on the basis of a contract, expenditures on health care provided to asylum seekers and costs for a permanent security service ensuring the protection of asylum facilities.
Expenditures on salaries, payments for work performed and insurance premiums also contributed significantly to total expenditures.
In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the migration policy and asylum process was marked by many budgetary measures that addressed the legitimate demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
Expenditures on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, expenditures on materials and services and expenditures on security services contributed decisively to the use of current expenditures.
The results of the inspection in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic pointed out some similar shortcomings which did not have a significant impact on the financial management and management of state property.
These were shortcomings, especially in the area of ​​using state budget funds, contrary to the purpose for which they were intended by the State Budget Act, when actions having the character of technical improvement of tangible fixed assets were covered from current expenditures.
The law on accounting in the area of ​​inventory and non-compliance with the chart of accounts was also violated.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the management of state property when it was left for use to another person without a contract.
Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes in the data of the Real Estate Cadastre violated the Real Estate Cadastre Act, and by leaving waste to be disposed of to a person who was not a person authorized to dispose of waste, the Waste Act was violated.
In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were also found in the provision of disproportionately high advances for electricity and natural gas consumption, shortcomings in the award of public contracts and in the management of state property, when its registration was not sufficiently ensured and the method of disposal of unnecessary assets was not proven.
The internal control system was ensured in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic in the sense of valid generally binding legal regulations that regulate the method of performing financial control.
No deficiencies were found in the submitted written documentation.
The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, despite some shortcomings identified, evaluate positively the approach of SUZ and MÚ in providing services for asylum seekers.
Based on the findings of the audit, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic state that despite the significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the relevant organizational units of both countries have .
The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.
The results of the inspection were discussed with the interested statutory representatives of the relevant organizational units of the state on the Czech and Slovak sides.
Based on the results of the audit, we recommend that the positive methodological experience from the audit be used in other joint control events within the framework of international cooperation of supreme audit institutions.
3. Legislative framework
In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, the right of asylum is based on the Geneva Convention of 1951 (Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the related New York Protocol of 1967).
The first legal regulation was implemented by Act No. 498/1990 Coll., On Refugees.
In the Czech Republic, Act No. 325/1999 Coll., On Asylum and on the Amendment of Act No. 83/1991 Coll., On the Police of the Czech Republic, has been in force since 1 January 2000.
This Act has been amended a total of five times (Act No. 2/2002 Coll., Act No. 217/2002 Coll., Act No. 320/2002 Coll., Act No. 519/2002 Coll. And Act No. 222/2003 Coll. .).
Two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., On Asylum, are currently in the legislative process, and the adoption of further amendments will be linked to European legislation.
At the time of drafting Act No. 325/1999 Coll., On asylum, the area of ​​asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and asylum documents were political documents in terms of binding force.
Already in the adoption of this law, there was an effort to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.
A significant change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum issues from the 3rd to the 1st pillar, when the right of asylum became a part of Community law from 1.5. 1999 on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty.
This shift has created the need to create appropriate legislation, ie. create legal instruments in appropriate legal force.
The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.
Key Community regulations in the field of asylum were adopted shortly before or only after the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, and their transposition deadline at the time of the Supreme Audit Office's inspection had not yet expired.
After their implementation into the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of the manner in which it has transposed it.
In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of state authorities in proceedings on granting refugee status and determining the obligations of foreigners who have applied for refugee status or who have been granted temporary refuge in the Slovak Republic was established with effect from 1 January 1996 by Act No. 283 of the National Council of the Slovak Republic. / 1995 Coll., On refugees.
Since 2003, the Act on Refugees has been replaced by Act No. 480/2002 Coll., “On Asylum and on Amendments to Certain Acts, which incorporated the harmonization of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with the Council of Europe Directive 2001/55 / ​​EC of 20 July On minimum standards for providing temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof.
After two amendments to Act No. 480/2002 Coll., On Asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonization of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU legislation in the area of ​​migration and asylum.
Its important elements are, for example, the determination of the obligation for asylum seekers to attend a basic Slovak language course during their stay in the integration center, the appointment of a guardian by courts for minors who remain in the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, enabling applicants to enter into employment in the amendment to the law.
The harmonization of the law of the Slovak Republic with the EU law in the area of ​​migration and the asylum process was assessed in the regular reports of the European Commission on the readiness of the Slovak Republic to join the EU.
In 2002, the report drew attention to the insufficient staff capacity of the Municipal Authority, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.
4. Asylum process
In the Czech Republic, since 1990, matters concerning refugees have been the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior.
With effect from 1 January 1996, the Ministry of the Interior set up an organizational unit of the SUZ state. The reason was the separation of the performance of state administration in the area of ​​the asylum procedure, which is performed through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the Ministry of the Interior, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.
The task of SUZ is to provide the Ministry of the Interior with the provision of accommodation, catering, health and other services to participants in asylum proceedings and asylum seekers.
In the Slovak Republic, the Municipal Authority performs decisive tasks in the area of ​​the asylum process, especially in terms of financial and material and technical support of the asylum process to the extent defined by special regulations.
Priority tasks are issues related to deciding on the applications of foreigners for asylum in the first instance of administrative proceedings and the comprehensive operation of asylum facilities in the area of ​​accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security of asylum seekers.
In addition, it prepares concepts for the migration policy of the state.
The results achieved in the field of creating an asylum system in the Slovak Republic in recent years have been significantly influenced by cooperation and support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (hereinafter "UNHCR").
A special benefit was his financial participation in the reconstruction of the housing stock for asylum seekers.
UNHCR also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.
4.1 Development of the number of asylum seekers and results of the asylum process
The development of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.
There was a significant increase in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis, and in 2003 there was an increase in the number of refugees from Chechnya.
An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic is given in Table 1.
During the audited period, a total of 394 cases were granted asylum, of which 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.
During the audited period, asylum was not granted in a total of 22,731 cases and in 22,636 cases the asylum procedure was terminated.
Number of participants in the proceedings as of 1.1. it includes both persons to whom a decision has not yet been issued and those to whom the decision has not been transmitted.
Also included are persons who have been forgiven for missing the deadline for filing an appeal, or for whom the previous decision has been annulled and a new one has not yet been issued.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers is constantly growing.
If in 1993 96 applicants were registered, in 2003 it was already 10,358 persons.
There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, when 8,131 applicants were registered, which represented an increase of 423% compared to 2000, in which 1,556 persons applied for asylum.
Data on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic in the audited period are given in Table 2.
In the audited period, a total of 49 asylums were granted and their number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in individual years.
Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.
Asylum proceedings were discontinued in a total of 23,088 cases.
The majority of applicants, by staying without a permit, stayed outside the asylum facility voluntarily left the asylum procedure before its termination.
In 2002 it was more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants and in 2003 it was more than 94% of persons.
The length of stay of one applicant in one of the asylum facilities, converted to the average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.
The findings of the Ministry of Interior also show that the majority of applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are looking for better living conditions, ie so-called economic migration, which has no support in documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has signed up.
In these cases, the asylum system is purposefully used by the applicant.
An asylum application based on economic reasons, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, is not a ground for granting asylum.
Such a request should be in accordance with the provisions of § 12 par. 1 letter a) of Act No. 480/2002 Coll., on Asylum, assessed as manifestly unfounded and should be decided on within 30 days.
Internationally recognized principles for identifying economic migrants have not yet been established to distinguish them from applicants persecuted in their country of origin and to speed up the asylum process.
Given the above facts, it can be stated that the Slovak Republic is a transit country in terms of international migration and the destination countries for migration were and still are Western European countries.
Following accession to the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement designating the State responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).
The Convention prevents the submission of multiple targeted asylum applications in several EU countries.
Applicants shall return to the country of first registration after a positive identification in EURODAC.
The Slovak Republic is part of the external borders of EU countries, therefore the application of the Dublin Convention may result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create conditions for residence in the Slovak Republic until a decision on granting or not granting asylum is issued.
4.2 Drawing funds
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers in accordance with international agreements and national legislation based on them.
The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditures drawn from the state budget is influenced primarily by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the final decision on granting asylum, as well as their state of health.
The growing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher uptake of statutory benefits for applicants, such as food, pocket money, basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.
The amount of some selected benefits is comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, in the audited period, the meal allowance was CZK 58 per person per day, out-of-pocket allowance CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child under 15 years of age.
The costs per asylum seeker per day of stay were on average CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.
In addition to the out-of-pocket allowance, asylum seekers accommodated in self-catering accommodation centers and privately accommodated applicants outside asylum facilities may be granted a contribution up to the subsistence level.
Act No. 325/1999 Coll., On asylum, as amended, grants, among other things, in § 84 to municipalities the right to a contribution to cover costs incurred in connection with an asylum facility in its territory.
The amount of the contribution was determined annually by government resolutions and in the audited period was CZK 7 per person per day of stay.
At the same time, municipalities are granted the right to a contribution to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.
The amount of the contribution in the audited period was CZK 120 per pupil and month, provided that in the given month the person in question attended school for at least 10 days.
In the Slovak Republic, in the audited period, the meal allowance was SKK 70 per person per day, out-of-pocket allowance SKK 12 per person per day and SKK 8 per child under 15 years of age.
The costs per asylum seeker per day of stay were on average SKK 442 in 2001, SKK 447 in 2002 and SKK 445 in 2003.
In accordance with Act No. 480/2002 Coll., On Asylum, municipalities in whose territory an asylum facility is located are provided with a contribution for partial reimbursement of expenses incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and operation of an asylum facility.
So far, municipalities have only partially used the opportunity to apply for a contribution, which is set at SKK 1,500 per bed and calendar year.
National legislation in both countries sets a 90-day period for issuing an asylum decision from the commencement of the asylum procedure, and at the same time allows for an extension of this period in justified cases.
The most common reason for extending the asylum procedure, which affects the amount of state budget expenditures, is the filing of appeals against decisions not to grant asylum.
In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was issued in the interval between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).
The second highest number was within 90 days from the date of submitting the application for asylum (17.61%).
In total, 73% of asylum proceedings initiated in 2001-2003 were finally decided within one year of their initiation.
Within a period of two years from the commencement of the asylum procedure, 92% of the asylum applications were finally decided.
In the Slovak Republic, according to the data of the Municipal Office, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum use the statutory possibility of extending the time limit by filing an appeal with a court.
In some cases, it was an extension of more than a year, and the court proceedings were not closed at the time of the inspection.
Some contribution to the shortening of the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of joint offices of the Municipal Office and the Border and Alien Police Office of the Police Force in the reception centers in Adamov-Gbelo, Opatovská Nová Ves and Liptovský Vlachy, which took place at the time of inspection from 1.10.2004.
This presupposes a simplification of procedures and a shortening of the time limits for proceedings between the two components of the asylum process.
5. Asylum facilities
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have set up asylum facilities in which they have gradually created suitable conditions for the provision of services to participants in asylum proceedings.
During the stay, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, meals, health care, pocket and basic material equipment and hygiene needs.
At the same time, courses are organized as part of leisure activities and conditions are created for applicants for cultural and sports activities.
5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic
SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is competent to manage state property in the areas of the reception center Vyšní Lhoty, reception and residence center Červený Újezd, residence centers Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the buildings of integration asylum centers Jaroměř and Stop near Brno.
At the beginning of 2002, a reception center was established in the transit area of ​​Prague-Ruzyně Airport.
SUZ also ensures the operation of asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntál, Zbýšov and Kašava, which are operated by a legal entity on the basis of Section 80 (3) of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., On Asylum.
The total accommodation capacity of the reception centers is 747 places and the total accommodation capacity of the residence centers is 1,977 places.
Reception centers are closed facilities that asylum seekers may not leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception procedures specified in Act No. 325/1999 Coll., On Asylum, have been performed.
Violation of the obligation to stay in the reception center is considered a misdemeanor.
The accommodation centers to which asylum seekers come from the reception centers are used to accommodate asylum seekers until the decision on their application for granting or not granting asylum takes legal effect.
Under certain conditions, asylum seekers have the opportunity to leave the residential centers, or to stay in private.
Asylum seekers shall be entitled to free accommodation, meals, other services and out-of-pocket expenses at reception and residence centers where they are registered, provided that they have undergone the necessary steps to establish their financial and financial situation, and such conditions shall be that they cannot be fairly demanded of even partial payment for the said services.
Integration asylum centers are used for temporary accommodation of persons who have been granted asylum.
Clients are accommodated in the center on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of extension until they manage to secure adequate housing for them, or they can provide it themselves within the state integration program.
In the integration center, clients pay for all accommodation costs and eat individually.
Persons with recognized refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.
5.1.1 Costs of asylum facilities
For the comparison of asylum facilities, it was chosen as the best telling indicator of the amount of costs per physical day of stay.
It is based on the actual number of persons who were actually provided with the services provided by the asylum facility each day.
In Table No. 3 and in the graph, the facilities operated by SUZ are marked as own and the facilities operated by legal entities on the basis of Section 80 of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., On Asylum, as contractual.
The cost of one day of stay in SUZ's own asylum facility decreases with the increasing occupancy of these facilities. The reason is that the fixed costs of operating the facilities are budgeted for more asylum seekers.
The volume of total costs incurred in providing services for asylum seekers increases in direct proportion to their increasing number.
In 2001 and 2003, applicants in crisis facilities were accommodated in their own asylum facilities.
In part of 2003, extraordinary accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds in total) was even used to address the capacity crisis of asylum facilities caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers of Chechen nationals from Poland.
This capacity was provided by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.
Expenditures per applicant per day of stay were then lower in these years.
However, long-term maintenance of the high occupancy of these devices is not possible.
The risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated need for higher accommodation capacity need to be taken into account.
At the same time, it is not possible to carry out some repairs, maintenance and investments when the accommodation capacity is fully occupied.
The form of asylum facilities operated under contract enables the adoption of operational solutions in the area of ​​asylum facilities capacities, if necessary.
5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic
Asylum facilities are reception centers and accommodation centers.
The Municipal Administration manages the Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and Brezová pod Bradlom residential centers.
The total capacity of the reception centers is 470 seats and the residence center 100 seats.
The growing number of asylum seekers was addressed by the Municipal Office by establishing a residence center in Gabčíkov in the leased premises of the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava with a flexible available capacity from 250 to 940 places.
According to the concluded contract, the lessee also provides services related to the operation of the center.
In this way, the Municipal Office addressed the lack of its own staff.
The residential center was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jaziercie with a capacity of 160 seats.
Reception centers had an average occupancy rate of 57% to 62% in the audited period, and an average of 33% to 50% occupancy centers in the audited period.
Occupancy varied according to the season and was highest in the last months of the year, when he applied for asylum by a much larger number of applicants compared to other months of the year.
A further increase in accommodation capacity by approximately 450 places will be possible after the reconstruction of the resorts in Opatovská Nová Ves and Vlachy.
After the completion of the center in Humenné in 2006, the number of seats will increase by another 550 people.
5.2.1 Costs of asylum facilities
Data on the amount of costs for the operation of asylum facilities are given in Table 4.
Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another entity that will provide premises and ensure the operation of the facility, including related activities, is one of the ways to ensure at reasonable cost the tasks arising from the stay of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic.
6. Management of financial resources and state property
6.1 Management analysis
In the Czech Republic, the approved budgeted expenditures of SUZ in 2001 were increased by thirteen budgetary measures by 103,077 thous. CZK.
Of which 89 979 ths. CZK (87.29%) were earmarked funds. The majority was intended to address the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44,538 thousand) and to provide health care provided to asylum seekers (CZK 38,870 thousand).
In 2002, SUZ expenditures were increased by twenty budget measures by 88,362 thousand CZK. CZK.
Of which 62 282 ths. CZK (70.48%) were earmarked funds, of which the majority (CZK 53,200,000) was earmarked for health care provided to asylum seekers.
In 2003, SUZ expenditures were increased by fourteen budgetary measures by a total of 88,078 thousand CZK. CZK.
Of which 82,000 thous. CZK (93.09%) amounted to earmarked funds released from the General Treasury.
Amount 51 000 ths. CZK was intended for health care provided to asylum seekers, 24,000 thous. CZK to address the influx of Chechen refugees and 7,000 thous. CZK for the program of humanitarian evacuations of the disabled population of the Republic of Iraq.
An overview of the drawing of selected SUZ expenditures in the audited period is given in Table 5.
From the above overview, it is clear that the highest part of the expenditure was spent on the provision of services.
The amount of expenditures on the purchase of services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total expenditures.
Explosive expenditures in this item were expenditures on accommodation and meals for applicants in asylum facilities operated on the basis of a contract, expenditures on medical care provided to asylum seekers and costs for permanent security services providing security in individual asylum facilities.
Expenditures on salaries, payments for work performed and insurance premiums contributed significantly to the total expenditures of SUZ (23.99% - 24.97%).
Last but not least, purchases of materials accounted for a significant share of SUZ's total expenditures (approximately 14%), with food purchases accounting for the highest share (7.61%? 9.83% of total expenditures).
In the Slovak Republic, the budget management of the Municipal Office for the provision of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by several budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
The draft and breakdown of the budget in the expenditure part was characterized in particular in 2001 and 2002 by an imbalance between the requirements of the Municipal Office, which was based on an increase in the number of asylum seekers and the need to finance their legal entitlements, and the resources provided.
During the year, the administrator of the budget chapter addressed the disproportion through several budgetary measures, which increased the limit of current expenditures in 2001 by 41.8% and in 2002 by as much as 71.7%.
An overview of the drawing of selected expenditures of the Municipal Authority in the audited period is given in Table No. 6.
Expenditures on wages, salaries and insurance premiums in the range from 24.47% to 30.51% and expenditures on materials and services in the range from 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditures contributed decisively to the drawing of current expenditures.
Expenditure on security services accounted for more than 10% and expenditure on food purchases from 3.92% to 7.20%.
Another significant part was represented by expenditures for accommodation and catering services with a share from 10.82% to 26.96%.
A relatively low share in the range from 1.03% to 6.25% was accounted for by capital expenditures.
6.2 Identified deficiencies
The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed out some similar shortcomings which did not have a significant impact on the management of state funds and property.
These were shortcomings in particular in the following areas: a) the use of state budget funds contrary to the purpose for which they were intended by the State Budget Act, when actions having the character of technical improvement of tangible fixed assets were covered from current expenditures; b) violation of the Act on Accounting in the field of inventories and non-compliance with the indicative chart of accounts.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the management of state property, when it was left for use to another person without a proper contract; the Act on the Real Estate Cadastre was violated by failing to meet the deadline for reporting changes to the data of the Real Estate Cadastre; by leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorized to dispose of waste, the Waste Act was violated.
In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were also found in the provision of disproportionately high advances for electricity and natural gas consumption, shortcomings in the award of public contracts and in the management of state property, when its registration was not sufficiently ensured and the method of disposal of unnecessary assets was not proven.
7. Internal control system
In the Czech Republic, as of 1.7. In 2002, an internal control system was introduced in the sense of the provisions of Act No. 320/2001 Coll., On financial control, determining the competencies of individual employees responsible for performing preliminary, ongoing and subsequent control.
At the same time, an internal audit system was introduced and the internal auditor of SUZ was appointed.
Every year, SUZ issues a plan of financial, social and operational technical inspections, the aim of which is a comprehensive verification of the management of financial resources and state property in individual asylum facilities managed by SUZ.
In 2002, 42 management checks were carried out and in 2003 54 were carried out.
In the Slovak Republic, the direct performance of control activities in the departments and organizations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic in terms of compliance with generally binding legal regulations and internal regulations is ensured by the Office of Control of the Minister.
Within the audited period, no control of the fulfillment of tasks in the area of ​​asylum policy was performed.
The internal control system of the Municipal Authority is focused primarily on the implementation of preliminary and ongoing financial control pursuant to Act No. 502/2001 Coll., On Financial Control and Internal Audit.
The performance of financial control is also regulated by the internal regulations of the Director of the Municipal Authority.
The factual focus of control activities as part of the management of individual departments was set within the annual plan of the Municipal Authority.
The directors of the unions were appointed to be responsible for carrying out inspections in this area.
According to the written documentation submitted, no deficiencies were identified.
Since the effective date of the Regulation of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic No. 28 of 23 April 2004, the Municipal Office is obliged to handle and investigate complaints in accordance with the Complaints Act.
In the near future, it will be necessary to resolve the organizational security of this task.
Communique
This report was prepared in Czech, English and Slovak and signed by the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office and the Chairman of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic.
Joint report on parallel controls on expenditure on the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway
Foreword
Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, it would be difficult to imagine a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe.
Quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the living standards of Europeans.
Creating conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of people and cargo is an important task for the state administration.
This is a very demanding task, both organizationally and technically, as well as financially.
European efforts for sustainable mobility often and hardly find compromises with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.
The construction of transport infrastructure, even thanks to the necessary measures in favor of the environment, is financially demanding.
Considered procedures and decisions of the state administration in the preparation and acquisition of transport constructions can bring significant savings of public financial resources, which can be used differently for the benefit of citizens.
One of the tasks of control institutions is to actively look for shortcomings that have led to lower than achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures on transport infrastructure constructions.
The control institutions should not only draw the attention of the state administration to the identified shortcomings, but also recommend measures that will lead to an improvement of the situation, for the benefit of the citizens, for the benefit of Europe.
Short summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as Germany and the Czech Republic), the Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as “BRH”) and the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as “SAO”) carried out parallel audits of Dresden (motorway D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in Germany).
The motorways are connected by a border bridge, which is co-financed by both countries.
Thanks to the cooperation with the SAO, the BRH was able to carry out a thorough control of the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.
On the basis of close cooperation with the BRH, the SAO obtained the necessary data on the amount of German costs for bridges and tunnels for comparative purposes.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded an agreement on the construction of a border bridge.
According to the progress of the construction, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.
However, during the award of the contract, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways of the Czech Republic (hereinafter "ŘSD") made mistakes that led to an extension of the competition period and a shortening of the construction time.
The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than expected.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.
As a result, however, the ŘSD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.
As part of joint inspection work, the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 motorways were compared, based on the conversion per m2 of bridge structure area.
Statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high costs per m2 of area.
The analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in the group of large bridges with a length of over 100 meters.
The price increase could also be attributed to the delay that occurred during the tender procedure.
In analyzing the costs of tunnel construction, the inspectors found that the prices of tunnels on the D 8 motorway are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
The BRH and the SAO now have a database of bridge and tunnel prices, which they will be able to rely on for future checks on the effectiveness of the funds used for transport infrastructure.
For the construction of bridges, both inspection institutions recommend: standardization of bridge constructions and the use of composite steel-concrete and special structures only in cases where prestressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.
The main features of the cooperation were her team spirit and informality.
During the parallel inspection, the inspectors shared their specific knowledge and skills.
Introduction
This report informs about the course and results of parallel inspections of funds spent on the construction of a motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The inspections focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the incurred expenses.
Parallel inspections were performed by the BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.
Parallel inspections took place in 2005 and 2006.
The SAO inspected the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures in the amount of approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately € 690 million) on the border section of the D 8 motorway, which has the number 0807.
Of this amount, € 64 million from European funds (ISPA) was planned to be used.
In addition to the parallel inspection carried out jointly with the SAO, the BRH inspected the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.
The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to around € 670 million, of which € 277 million will be co-financed by European funds (ERDF).
The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the trans-European transport corridor IV. Dresden - Central and Southern Part of Eastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D 8 motorway leads from Prague via Ústí nad Labem to the state border.
The A 17 motorway leads from the Czech / German state border to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, the border sections of both motorways were under construction.
These sections were put into operation on December 21, 2006.
On the German side, the motorway is completed as far as Dresden, while on the Czech side the D 8 motorway is not completed, because the section No. 0805 in the length of 16.4 km through the Bohemian Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosice is still in the preparatory phase.
According to the plan, section No. 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of ​​České středohoří.
According to forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, the traffic intensity in 2008 at the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 motorway should be 22,940 vehicles per day.
According to German forecasts, in 2010 the intensity of traffic on the Czech border will total about 25,000 vehicles per day.
In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded an Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the connection of the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border by the construction of a border bridge.
Both states are involved in the construction of the bridge, so the inspection of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of the parallel inspections carried out by both inspection institutions.
Cooperation between the BRH and the SAO
Since mid-2005, the two Supreme Audit Institutions have been negotiating close cooperation in inspecting the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.
Both parties had serious reasons for such cooperation:
1.
Germany contributes financially to the construction of the border bridge.
Its planning and construction is based on ŘSD.
Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to inspect this construction project.
2.
The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds had been used economically in terms of the overall level of costs for bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The SAO needed to ensure the effectiveness of expenditure, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, in particular the layout of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of driving on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, the Agreement on the Coordinated Inspection of the D 8 / A Motorway 17 was signed on 4 January 2006 by the Presidents of the two Supreme Audit Institutions.
Joint working meetings of the BRH and SAO inspectors took place throughout 2006 at intervals of approximately six to eight weeks.
The negotiations addressed current issues and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the inspection of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.
An important feature of the cooperation was the continuous exchange of information.
While the BRH performed most of the work on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the tender procedure, the SAO largely prepared a methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels.
The applicable legal norms for control in the state administration differ in both countries in the way of closing control actions.
For these reasons, the two SAIs have drawn their own audit conclusions on their findings obtained during their audits.
This report reflects the results obtained in the parallel inspections.
The cooperation will end with the signing of the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of a border bridge
In a 2000 agreement, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a date for the completion of the construction of the border bridge, if possible in 2005.
The two parties then agreed to postpone this deadline until the end of 2006.
ŘSD acted as investor.
Germany contributes 42.13% financially to the construction of the bridge.
In the period up to 1999, the ŘSD proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed reinforced concrete structure.
In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, ŘSD approved a composite steel-concrete structure.
This decision was justified by the reduction in the number of double pillars from seven to five and the consequent environmental benefits of such a solution for the valley.
In addition, comparative calculations performed by ŘSD stated that a composite steel-concrete structure should be a less expensive option.
But there was an error in the calculations.
It stated that the new composite steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.
In fact, it is 5% longer.
During the award of the contract for the border bridge, the ŘSD made serious mistakes.
It did not prepare the tender dossier, which would adequately describe the criteria for assessment and partial criteria for comparing tenders.
This error led to the evaluation and evaluation committee and the Director-General evaluating the tenders subjectively and in a problematic manner.
The unsuccessful tenderer challenged the results of the tender procedure.
A subsequent investigation by the Office for the Protection of Competition resulted in the construction contract being signed later than originally envisaged.
This meant that the summer construction season of 2004, after evaluating the bids, was wasted and the time set aside for construction was shortened.
The construction company agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.
The offered procedure included double assembly of the bridge superstructure, a change in the construction of the pillars and the establishment and equipment of assembly spaces.
In addition, the construction company was not able to obtain the originally designed type of steel in the required time.
The new type of steel - at a price higher by about € 4 million, which had to be paid in full by ŘSD - made it possible to shorten the time for anti-corrosion protection, which subsequently made it possible to shorten the total construction time of the border bridge.
Compared to the net price of € 18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge will increase significantly due to the accelerated procedure and other adjustments in funding.
The reduced time set aside for construction work has led to a price increase of around € 5.9 million.
At present, the amount of net costs is around € 25.9 million, without taking into account the automatic increase in prices (as of October 2006).
Comparison of prices of bridges and tunnels
The two supreme audit institutions analyzed the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 motorways in order to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.
The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.
Furthermore, the tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).
There are no similar tunnels on the A 17 motorway.
In preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to accurately identify the relevant prices.
The two Supreme Audit Institutions have established the following principles for comparing bridge prices: based on the actual price paid for the bridge without value added tax (VAT rates differ in the Czech Republic and the SNR and are subject to change); disregard prices for special bridge foundations; convert prices in CZK to € according to the rate of the European Central Bank valid as of 30 December 2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).
On D 8 and A 17 there are bridges of various constructions (steel-concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, composite steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes.
In an effort to ensure the homogeneity of the examined structures, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of structure.
Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyzes.
By far the most common type of structure was concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8, 36 bridges on the A 17).
The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, as the size of the set allowed the use of mathematical-statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of the results.
The inspections revealed that the prices per m 2 of concrete bridges on D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of bridge structure.
For German bridges, the price dependence on size was stronger than for Czech bridges (see graphs below).
Two concrete bridges on the A 17 and four on the D 8 have been identified, the price of which is significantly higher.
To find these bridges, a method was used to determine atypical values ​​in a set of numbers, as well as a regression analysis taking into account the dependence of the bridge price on its size (to determine atypically expensive bridges, the standard distance from the regression curve is upwards).
However, information on the atypically high price of these bridges should only be considered as an indicator of which bridges to focus on.
In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of the high price in each identified case should be analyzed.
One such cause may be inefficient administrative measures, or environmental protection requirements or other acceptable reasons.
Given that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German ones (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the price of a bridge on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.
The hypothesis of lower prices of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labor costs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on the D 8 are higher than on the A 17.
During the joint negotiations, two possible causes of this situation were identified:
1.
In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.
Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional companies to participate in the tender.
In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of a contract for a part of a motorway route that is several kilometers long.
Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too large for them.
2.
In the Czech Republic there is greater variability in the construction of bridges than in Germany.
In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge construction was decided long before its construction.
The decision is made at the time when the ŘSD translates the application for a zoning decision.
At this time, the ŘSD selects bridge types from several variants, but economy plays a smaller role in decision-making.
A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could be expressed only on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction market in both countries, which, however, would go beyond the scope of this inspection.
The border bridge is the most expensive composite steel-concrete bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
In the case of tunnels, it was found that the prices of tunnels on the D 8 are twice as high as tunnels in Germany.
However, a comparison of the main construction and technical parameters of the D 8 tunnels with the tunnels in Germany did not show any significant difference.
Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the Czech Republic in the field of tunnel construction.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow general conclusions to be drawn.
Efficiency and effectiveness of the construction of the Dresden - Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved a concept for the development of the motorway network.
The D 8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.
Section No. 0805 across the Bohemian Central Mountains was to be acquired before the border section No. 0807.
The Czech Republic acquires the D 8 motorway as part of program financing.
In the program No. 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague - Ústí nad Labem - state border of the Czech Republic / Germany" two goals were set for the construction of the D 8 motorway:
1.
to improve the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem - a national goal;
2.
to improve the connection between Prague and Berlin within the framework of IV. trans-European transport corridor Berlin-Istanbul - international destination.
According to the program, the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section No. 0807 in June 2007.
It should be added here that the completion date is not identical to the commissioning date.
The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains is now in the stage of an official zoning decision.
Environmental activists have challenged the decision with lawsuits.
There is no final decision on the actions.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains will be completed several years later than stated in the program documentation.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the completion date of section No. 0805 to 2010.
As a result of the above facts, the construction of the border section did not reach the national goal - improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.
ŘSD performed an estimate of capital expenditures for the border section D 8 No. 0807 and section No. 0805 across the Bohemian Central Mountains in the years 1999 - 2001.
The estimated investment costs included in these capital expenditures are around € 639 million together for both sections 0805 and 0807.
Table 2: Results of the economic assessment (EIRR = internal rate of return)
All considered motorways and expressways open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.
In the northern part of the border section, the intensity of traffic was 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010
All considered motorways and expressways open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.
In the northern part of the border section, the intensity of traffic was 22,000 vehicles per day in 2010
All considered motorways and expressways open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.
In the northern part of the border section, the intensity of traffic was 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010
The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and the section across the Bohemian Central Mountains will be completed on time.
At the time of the inspection, however, it is clear that the section across the Bohemian Central Mountains will not be open in the original term.
This will reduce the above EIRR values.
Costs for both sections excluding VAT, calculated as at 31 December 2005, were € 897 million, ie 27.4% higher than the level of costs used in the economic analysis in 2001.
However, there is a risk that section 0805 will be run on another, more expensive route, which would affect the above-mentioned economic viability threshold.
The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable with a traffic intensity of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but a study addressing the issue of detours for the missing section through the Czech Central Highlands envisages a traffic intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, which pushes the investment below the limit of economic viability.
With a higher load of detours for the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion, and thus an increase in external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic analysis.
The above-mentioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the border section D 8 should have had will not be achieved.
Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.
Also during the construction of the A 17 motorway, the costs were exceeded in a similar way as in the case of these two sections on the D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment of the federal road development plan for long-distance transport for 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany estimated the cost of around € 320 million.
The resulting cost / income ratio was then 4.6.
In the meantime, however, costs have risen sharply to around € 670 million, reducing the cost / income ratio by more than half.
In addition to the parallel inspection carried out jointly with the SAO, the BRH inspected the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.
At the same time, the BRH found that the competent state approval authority required an off-road tunnel for the third section A 17, which was not needed.
During the inspection, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the German Road Construction Administration that a tunnel was not necessary.
The result was savings that amounted to around € 10 million in construction costs alone and € 0.15 million in annual operating costs.
During the assessment of the first section A 17 BRH found that the construction project was not properly prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
In the preparatory stage, the road construction administration did not carry out a survey of the bedrock conditions in the Dölzschen rocks, as the site was difficult to access.
This was done only after the tunnel boring machine hit a rock.
Tests have shown that the rocks are more weathered inside than expected during the tender.
Therefore, costly measures had to be taken, such as mooring, grouting and stone fall protection nets, which required around € 3.3 million.
The Directorate of Roads and Motorways had to bear the costs not only of other emergency operations, such as safety measures in the Dölzschen rocks, but also measures that would not be necessary if the construction project had been properly prepared first.
Expenditure of this kind includes costs related to the interruption of construction operations (€ 3.2 million), further training of drilling staff (€ 0.5 million) and rising wages and expenditure on goods due to the project being exceeded (€ 7 million).
The cost overrun thus amounted to approximately € 10.7 million, which did not correspond to any added value.
Based on the lessons learned from this and other audited projects, the BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter management in its supervision of road construction work.
At the same time, the Federal Ministry should give the Roads and Motorways Directorates the necessary impetus to implement quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for the BRH and the SAO The cooperation fulfilled the intention of both audit institutions.
BRH gained control knowledge about the preparation, assignment and course of construction of the border bridge.
The two Supreme Audit Institutions have set up a database of bridge and tunnel prices on which future inspections can be based.
The SAO found that the main construction and technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway do not differ from the parameters of A 17.
The inspectors of both institutions participating in the cooperation gained new experience, which they can use in further inspections.

Coordinated control of funds intended for financing projects implemented under the Operational Program for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Poland 2007–2013
INTRODUCTION
The developing community of the people of Europe is the driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.
Let us therefore give this community an introductory word on this joint report of the two supreme audit institutions of the neighboring countries:
"185 million EU citizens (37% of the population) live in border areas.
These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral areas, often a remnant of the darker parts of European history.
The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help alleviate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and to further develop the dormant potential of border regions.
The programs cover different border regions: some cover maritime areas, others inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.
Most programs are bilateral, but some include more than two neighboring countries. "
The programs run for seven years and receive a total of € 5.7 billion from the EU budget.
"The programs include the following activities: repairs and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycle paths and bridges, investments in cross-border waste management systems, medical facilities, research centers, flood defenses, etc., joint management of natural sites or development of tourist destinations, development of joint services for local people, employment counseling, the creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.
Support from the program is provided on the condition that organizations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or small and medium-sized enterprises) come together to implement projects that are based on the needs of the border region.
Representatives of the cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly to decide which projects will be supported.
This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the end of the program itself.
Funding is provided on condition that the project partners on both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfills at least two of the following four characteristics: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing. "
Within the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and divided by the relevant partners.
The main attributes of the partnership include: joint choice of the lead partner, joint preparation of the project and application, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, assumption of overall responsibility for project implementation by the lead partner, total support payments received by the lead partner and transferred to the relevant project partners.
Eligible projects implemented on the territory of regions and voivodships adjacent to the common border may be supported.
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CONTROL
On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Program for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Poland 2007–2013 (OPPS ČR – POL).
€ 258,187,467 was allocated for the implementation of the operational program.
The total amount included a contribution from European Funds (ERDF) in the total amount of € 219,459,344 (85%), which must be used by the end of 2015.
Financial data on the drawing of EU funds from the Operational Program for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Poland 2007–2013 at the end of 2013 are given in the following table:
The Agreement on Cooperation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the Presidents of both authorities on 27 February 2013 following previous mutual negotiations at the September 2012 in Lovasberény, Hungary.
The aim of the cooperation was to verify whether the implementation of the operational program is in accordance with legislation and binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system works reliably, whether the objectives of the operational program are achieved and whether selected projects are implemented in accordance with the conditions. .
This co-operation took the form of a parallel audit, in which the audit authorities, on the basis of their statutory mandate, independently examined the topics, the content of which had been discussed together in advance.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
The performed audit also included elements of a performance audit.
Selected topics were examined on a sample of projects at project partners on both sides of the border.
The result of the performed inspections were audit conclusions published in the usual way by both authorities.
This joint report is based on the two audit conclusions set out in the Annex.
The selected joint control sample included six projects (Annex 1), which fall into the area of ​​support 1.1 - Strengthening transport accessibility and the area of ​​support 2.2 - Support for the development of tourism.
Prior to the start of the audit, the drawing of funds from these two areas of support represented more than 60% of the funds paid to the beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects within the entire OPPS CR-POL.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
In addition to the inspection of a joint sample of six projects, the SAO inspected another 13 projects and the NIK inspected another two (all from the area of ​​support 1.1 and 2.2).
The funds paid to the beneficiaries of ERDF support, which were audited by the SAO and the NIK, totaled € 25,362,174 (SAO) and € 8,450,784 (NIK).
The controlled volume of funds represented 41% of all funds paid to beneficiaries from support areas 1.1 and 2.2.
MAIN AUDIT CONCLUSIONS
Both inspections carried out independently by the SAO on the Czech side and the NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of identified irregularities did not exceed the level of materiality.
The implementation of the OPPS CR-POL, including the functioning of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.
The auditees, who were part of the management and control system, took steps to reduce the risk of misuse of funds and non-utilization of ERDF funds provided.
Proof of the effectiveness of the implemented projects within the operational program is the high level of fulfillment of the set objectives, which was also supported by the results of the survey of social evaluation of project implementation.
SUMMARY OF CONTROL RESULTS
A. Evaluation of the management and control system
The coordinated approach made it possible to control the management and control system of OPPS CR-POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry for Regional Development of the Czech Republic), the national coordinator (Ministry for Regional Development POL) and controllers (Center for Regional Development and Voivodship).
At the same time, the coordinated audit enabled the evaluation of the tasks and functions performed by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.
During the evaluation of the management system, the audit focused on activities carried out in connection with the setting up and performance of the function of managing authority and national coordinator, in particular in setting the program objectives and monitoring progress, evaluation activities and annual reports, assessments, evaluations, selection and approval project applications, drawing on program funds and fulfilling the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on grants, as well as control activities of the managing authority, setting up activities and outputs from audits of the authorized audit entity and irregularities reporting and monitoring system. coordination of tasks and cooperation between institutions involved in the OPPS CR-POL.
Furthermore, the activities of the competent authorities in the area of ​​risk analysis and the compilation of on-site inspection plans were examined, and the evaluation of project applications carried out by independent evaluators was assessed.
The audit of the control system included a review of administrative and on-the-spot checks to approve, for example, deliveries of goods and co-financed services, eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement and compliance of these funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with national legislation and legislation. EU.
Significant shortcomings were identified by the SAO's audit in the area of ​​publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information on the subsidies provided.
In the area of ​​project evaluation and approval, the risk of non-transparency of this process was identified.
Other shortcomings were found in the area of ​​setting monitoring indicators and in setting up the irregularity reporting system.
Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and management system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.
The irregularities found by the NIK, which concerned the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to breaches of applicable laws and regulations, were not assessed as significant.
These irregularities had an impact only on individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the entire OPPS CR-POL.
Despite the identified discrepancies, the NIK assessed the functioning of the system positively.
B. Evaluation of project results
The audit did not show a discrepancy between the indicators and objectives set for individual projects and those defined by the operational program.
In all audited projects, the expected results were achieved, the financed activities were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operational program were met.
The audit conclusions are in accordance with the result of the survey of the social evaluation of the implementation of projects described below.
An important aspect to which the SAO and NIK paid attention in their conclusions is the limited possibility of objective evaluation of the fulfillment of the expected results of individual projects with regard to the objectives of individual projects and at the same time to the objectives of the entire operational program.
At the initiative of the Supreme Chamber of Control, a public opinion survey was conducted, which took place in the summer of 2013 at the place of implementation of projects selected for the joint control sample.
The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).
Following an agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the survey was conducted on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both with the public in Poland in relation to part of the project implemented by Polish project partners and with the Czech public in relation to part of the project in the Czech Republic.
The survey mainly concerned the suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and the social function of projects, including investments made.
The number of respondents for individual projects is given in Annex 2.
The assessment of the survey responses indicated that the overall social evaluation of the projects was good and reached a value of 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), which means that project results were positively perceived by most respondents both in terms of objectives and other parameters. specified in the project applications.
According to the respondents, the examined projects met the criteria expressed in the operational program.
Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, the quality of life of citizens and the resumption of contacts between the inhabitants of the border region.
On the other hand, the overall evaluation of the responses indicated a certain difference between the actual level of fulfillment of the objectives / parameters (actual degree of impact) and the level expected by the respondents.
This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.
The results of the survey were in line with the opinions of participants in panel discussions (target groups) carried out within the NIK inspection on the Polish side, who pointed out the need for project implementation and confirmed their positive public acceptance and fulfillment of expected results.
C. Evaluation of the legality of the audited projects
The compliance of material and time implementation of the project with the schedule and content of the project application was checked, the fulfillment of set goals and purpose of the project, fulfillment of binding monitoring indicators, management of changes in projects, handling of possible project revenues, fulfillment of separate accounting records of project transactions, compliance with the ban on financing projects from other EU sources, implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its conditions, compliance with mandatory publicity concerning especially raising awareness of EU project financing sources, compliance with conditions of eligibility of project expenditures, selection of suppliers and verification of delivered contracts.
The total financial value of deficiencies qualified by the SAO and NIK as expenditure ineligible for EU funding was found to be € 85,094.
However, this amount did not exceed the set level of materiality related to the total volume of funds controlled for the sample of projects.
Despite the identified irregularities, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of selected projects positively by the beneficiaries.
In most cases, the obligations arising from the conditions of the aid were properly fulfilled by the beneficiary.
Funds intended for the implementation of audited projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.
Nevertheless, irregularities in the fulfillment of material and financial obligations were found in seven of the eight beneficiaries controlled by NIK.
These were individual cases of a non-systemic nature and concerned in particular the inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breaches of public procurement rules, which, however, did not have an impact on the selection of the contractor or the delivery of the contractually agreed works.
Only in one of all projects audited by the NIK can a detected irregularity concerning non-compliance with reporting obligations be assessed as ineligible expenditure, amounting to PLN 43 003 (of which € 8,231 financed from the ERDF).
On the other side of the border, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure in the amount of CZK 2,098,053 in three of the 19 projects audited (of which € 76,863 financed from the ERDF).
Irregularities included non-delivery of paid material and works or expenditure on modernization of real estate owned by a person who was not linked to the project either as a beneficiary or as a project partner.
RECOMMENDATION
The joint recommendation of the SAO and the NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system, especially with regard to the consistent setting of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational program.
In general, it is also necessary to strive for the establishment of such indicators at the level of the program and projects, which will enable a more reliable verification of the fulfillment of the determined impacts.
The comments and recommendations resulting from the inspections carried out on both sides of the border are included in the separate audit conclusions of the SAO and the NIK on CD.
COMMUNIQUE
The report was prepared in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the presidents of the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland.
Procurement of construction work and prevention of corruption
Joint report on parallel audits carried out by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)
Introduction and overview
Procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the public and private sectors.
The role of the state is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.
In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor in the success of the Single Economic Space.
The EU has set limits in its regulations above which a contracting authority must meet certain requirements to guarantee a wide and unrestricted competitive environment throughout the EU.
EU Member States must therefore transpose and put European procurement law into national law.
The Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.
For public contracts that are below the EU limits in value, the regulation of their award remains within the competence of individual countries.
In addition, public procurement is prone to corruption with consequent high potential for harm.
Therefore, contracting authorities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and unfair favoritism (prevention of corruption).
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits in the area of ​​procurement procedures and prevention of corruption in buildings and transport structures.
The cooperation was also focused on the area of ​​European procurement law as it was transposed into national legislation.
The inspections also included the award of contracts below European limits in order to cover the area of ​​corruption prevention.
The audit findings of the two SAIs are summarized in a joint report addressed, inter alia, to international organizations such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Areas of control and controlled institutions
The BRH assessment is based on comprehensive inspections of the above-mentioned areas, which were carried out by the German building administrations responsible for federal transport and civil engineering in the years 2011 to 2012.
For example, the construction of motorways and large-scale building construction projects were evaluated.
The BRH also included findings from previous inspections in the evaluation.
The SAO's evaluation is based on inspections carried out during the years 2008 to 2012, which focused on the construction of roads, railways, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other structures in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, federal public procurement is mostly carried out by the state building administrations.
In the Czech Republic, state institutions for road and railway construction are responsible for awarding public contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In the field of building construction, the award of public contracts is carried out by entities that are recipients of budget funds.
In both countries, the services of external experts are also used in the individual phases of the procurement procedure.
The evaluation must take into account the differences in public procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in the two countries.
The structure of the law on public procurement in both countries
In Germany, the conduct of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and the relevant administrative acts.
The internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.
Further details concerning the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are enshrined in the so-called federal government procurement manuals, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail with regard to legal precedents in the field of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the award of public contracts is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legal regulations that apply to contracts with a value above and below European limits.
The contracting law underwent significant changes in 2012.
The new rules have strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened up space for more competition and reduced opportunities for corruption during the procurement process.
Basic aspects of procurement law in both countries
As far as European procurement procedures are concerned, open and restricted procedures in particular need to be applied in both countries.
In Germany, contracts below the European threshold are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for tenders, restricted call for tenders, negotiated procedure), but these are practically identical to the above conditions for European tenders.
Public procurement in Germany is characterized by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates are invited on a European scale) and public invitations to participate (only in the case of national procedures).
In open procedures and in the invitation to participate in the competition, the tender may be submitted by any interested party.
Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized companies.
This is achieved primarily by dividing the total public contract into commercially specific parts and dividing it into partial contracts.
By awarding contracts divided into these parts, it is given a chance to participate in the procedure by as many interested parties as possible.
The two characteristics of German contract law are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are registered in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, it is necessary to apply the conditions of European procedures also in cases of awarding public contracts with a value below the EU limit.
An exception is the simplified sub-limit procedure, where the contracting authority may use less demanding procedures.
In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which a contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favorable price.
Current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between open and restricted procedures.
There are 85,000 registered construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.
The total volume of contracting authorities' contracts for public works and the share of individual types of proceedings in both countries
In 2011, the total volume of construction work in Germany amounted to 7,675 billion.
CZK, of which CZK 1,138 billion (15%) accounted for the share of public contracts, which, in addition to contracts awarded by the federal government, also included contracts awarded by individual federal states and municipalities.
The total volume of federal road and building projects (excluding the construction of railways and waterworks) reached CZK 212.5 billion.
In 2011, the composition of federal contracts for civil engineering and transport construction was as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public calls; 12.7% restricted procedures and restricted calls;
6.6% negotiated procedures and direct award of contracts; 33.2% is the share of European tenders.
The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic in 2011 reached CZK 118.6 billion, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.
In 2009, it reached the value of CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37% of the total volume.
Structure of types of procurement procedures in 2011: 65.1% open procedures; 14.3% restricted procedure; 9.5% negotiated procedure; 8.4% simplified procedures for sub-threshold contracts; 2.7% other proceedings.
The figures include all public supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.
These figures show that: parallel controls in both countries focused on a substantial part of public procurement procedures; the prevention of corruption, which must always be taken into account in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open meaning. Procurement procedures are of key importance.
Summary of main results
The SAO and the BRH carried out parallel inspections of the award of European works contracts with an emphasis on the prevention of corruption in their countries.
The inspections focused on the comparison of legislation in both countries and the EU and on the implementation of public procurement in the field of land and transport construction.
Here are the key findings:
The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national law of both countries (points 1 and 3.1).
Prevention of corruption is not only the goal of the EU directive, but the national procurement rules of both countries, which differ in part in terms of focus and detail.
In both countries, the basic requirement that the tender dossier must meet is the inclusion of all the information needed to prepare tenders.
The specification must be neutral and must not contain any requirements restricting competition.
The tender documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the problem is the insufficient definition of the subject of the contract.
In Germany, the division of contracts into lots is required where possible in order to promote a competitive environment.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement is complied with in Germany.
The SAO's inspections have shown that in the Czech Republic, considerable volumes of public works are awarded in the field of road construction, without being divided into parts, or they are divided, but only into very significant parts in terms of volume. This can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.
These limitations on market potential can result in significant cost increases and create the risk of frivolous price negotiations and inadmissible agreements.
Legislation in both countries allows contracting authorities, under certain conditions, to subcontract further construction work if this need arises only after the conclusion of the contract (point 4.1).
In both countries, the requirements for the correct determination of the type of procurement procedure are met.
In the Czech Republic, according to the valid regulations, contracting authorities are free to determine one of the open procurement procedures, namely open procedure or restricted procedure.
German procurement and budgetary law gives priority to open procedures for both European tenders and national tenders, known as public invitations to tender.
Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a wider range of bidders to submit a bid and also reduce the risk of corruption, as they make it difficult to negotiate prices illegally between bidders.
At the same time, the best results are achieved in the area of ​​value for money.
In the case of large contracts whose estimated total price reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, the audited contracting authorities always issued a European procurement procedure.
In determining the type of procurement procedure, the correct determination of the estimated value of the contract plays a very important role.
In Germany, databases are used to objectively determine the price of public works, in which the values ​​are based on completed construction projects.
This is a sufficiently objective tool.
In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the field of road construction, but they are not yet an effective tool (Section 4.2).
When awarding a works contract under European procurement procedures, it is necessary to publish prior information and a call for tenders in order to strengthen competition by enabling candidates to prepare in time for tenders.
As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.
In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and / or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).
There is a greater risk of manipulation when selecting candidates for participation in a restricted tender procedure.
Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and published well in advance.
In addition to EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should, as often as possible, rotate candidates who are invited to participate in the selection process when selecting suppliers.
In Germany, the requirements for risk prevention are partly very detailed.
In some cases, the audited contracting authorities did not comply with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (section 4.4).
In both countries, contracting authorities must ensure during the procurement procedure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.
Any agreements between these candidates and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications must be avoided as far as possible so as not to restrict competition by means of illegal agreements.
In Germany, the relevant measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.
However, the German contracting authorities inspected did not comply with this requirement in several cases (point 4.5).
In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.
The requirements for labeling, documentation, protection and confidentiality of tenders are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
Inspections in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (section 4.6).
The assessment and evaluation of tenders is procedurally regulated in both countries.
The relevant German measures are more complex, but have not always been respected by the inspected contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities have forwarded their tenders to third parties for inspection without prior assessment, without duly documenting any suspicious circumstances.
The tenders were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (point 4.7).
Due to the legal protection of the enterprises, the participants must be informed about the intended award of the contract before the latter is finalized.
This legal protection rule is also designed to prevent corruptive action.
The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.
Only in a few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).
The tender documentation was not always complete or completely credible for the audited contracting authorities in both countries.
In the case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level were not always properly respected in the minutes.
In addition, some of the identified shortcomings reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the documentation.
Contracting authorities in both countries mostly fulfilled their reporting obligations (section 4.9).
Summary of the main principles of European procurement law and prevention of corruption
European contract law
To ensure free competition in the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted, inter alia, a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts to ensure the free movement of goods and services and a directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to review procedures. in the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (Review Procedures Directive), the two directives were to be transposed into national law.
The EU's general procurement principles include in particular: the requirement for a competitive environment; the requirement of equal treatment or non-discrimination; transparency requirement.
EU procurement principles include The Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public contracts also includes provisions for construction projects with a total estimated value of € 5 million or more.
These provisions affect: the content of the tender dossier; the type of procurement procedure used; disclosure of certain information before, during and after the proceedings; meeting the deadline for receipt of tenders; qualification requirements that may be required of candidates; criteria for selecting the most suitable tender.
The legal protection of candidates is governed by the Review Procedures Directive.
In the event of a potential breach of the contract award law, tenderers may have the contracting authority's decision reviewed in accordance with the examination procedures.
Both countries have transposed EU requirements into national legislation.
Corruption prevention
The importance of corruption prevention
In neither country is there a legal definition of what corruption actually means.
Corruption is generally understood as the abuse of personal (confidential) status for one's own benefit.
As a rule, this means that such abuse is encouraged by those who benefit.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause serious economic losses.
It is estimated that the total damage related to corruption amounts to 5% of world economic output.
For the EU, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.
If a contracting authority is involved in the contract, conventions restricting competition or allowing unfair practices may undermine confidence in the integrity, ability and overall work of the public administration.
Therefore, the prevention of corruption is a crucial task for contracting authorities.
Practices and procedures must be monitored, especially in areas particularly prone to corruption, so that adequate measures can be taken to prevent them.
Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of the decision-making process to corruption.
Procurement of construction works is generally considered to be a particularly vulnerable area to corruption.
Measures in the field of corruption prevention
In Germany, corruption can be prosecuted under criminal and labor law, in particular active and passive bribery, acceptance and offering of significant benefits.
The German federal government has issued a manual with recommendations concerning the prevention of corruption in the federal administration, according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process outside the risk analysis: the priority of open procurement; the principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; planning, procurement and accounting phase departments; accurate and complete documentation of the tender procedure.
In addition, other measures having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of the procurement law.
In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry introduced information technology to support a system for monitoring the award of contracts for the construction of federal roads.
With this system, data such as estimated costs, total contract value and involvement of private design offices can be fully recorded and analyzed to identify possible irregularities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, and the level of labor or civil law is also possible.
The legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and the prohibition of any discrimination during the entire procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of preventing corruption.
Anti-corruption measures in this area were set by the government in the "Government Strategy for the Fight against Corruption for the Period 2011 to 2012", which was updated for 2013 and 2014.
Part of the mentioned measures was incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and related implementing regulations.
The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: reduction of limits for small-scale contracts; the obligation of prior notification by the contracting authority, including the reasons for the contract; a ban on limiting the number of candidates in restricted procedures and the abolition of the general possibility to limit the number of candidates by drawing lots; the obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors.
Results of controls related to the subsequent stages of the procurement procedure
Tender documentation
The tender dossier must contain all the information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their tenders in an appropriate form.
In particular, the documentation must make it possible to process the offer price.
For this to be possible, tenderers must not be exposed to risks which they could not have foreseen.
The tender documentation contains mainly the specifications, as well as the requirements for proving the qualifications of the tenderers and the criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.
Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption
European law contains, in particular, requirements concerning technical specifications.
The specification must restrict competition as little as possible and all interested parties must have equal access to it.
The specification must be neutral.
Requirements for specific products are permissible on a very limited scale in the tender documents.
The basic principle of corruption prevention is that the tender documentation does not contain requirements that could restrict competition.
The documentation should also avoid ambiguities or inaccurate data, which create room for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.
The basic principle is that specifications are generally given without reference to a specific product or brand.
The specification must specify the supplies and services required and specify the numbers of units of work and supplies.
In normal cases, prices should be quoted by units of work or supply (eg in CZK / m or in CZK / item).
Defining the required works in terms of their functionality is permissible only in exceptional cases.
In principle, the rule is that the specification must be drawn up completely and unambiguously.
They must contain the exact quantities and must not include works and supplies the necessity of which is not entirely clear.
Reimbursement in the form of lump sums or time worked should be avoided where possible.
These parts of the tender dossier must preclude speculation and manipulation based on ambiguous specifications.
The specifications must enable each tenderer to prepare his tender with confidence and without undue preparatory work.
The invitation to tender must be published only when the tender dossier is complete.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for contracting authorities to award construction contracts in installments.
The contracting authority may divide the public contract into several separate parts, if the nature of the subject of such a contract allows it.
In Germany, the application of the rule of dividing works into parts is required, either quantitatively (partial deliveries) or according to specific considerations (specialized parts of the contract).
This allows small and medium-sized entities to participate in the competition, increases the number of potential bidders and makes it difficult to fix prices.
This type of award is usually considered the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.
In the Czech Republic, the tender documentation must contain evaluation criteria for national and European tender procedures.
In this way, the tenderer should be comprehensively and exhaustively informed of the criteria according to which his tender will be evaluated.
In Germany, the requirement to include evaluation criteria in the notification only applies to European invitations to tender.
In national procurement procedures, it is only necessary to include evaluation criteria in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.
If the tender dossier is prepared by authorized independent experts, German regulations require the exclusion of any information that would help to identify the specific companies, architects or designers involved.
The reason is to prevent individual construction companies from obtaining, without the knowledge of the contracting authority, any additional information or other unacceptable competitive advantages through contacts with these independent experts.
This is also the reason why independent experts must not publish tender documents and make them accessible for scrutiny.
The contracting authority is the only point of contact for construction companies.
The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.
In the case of large construction projects, after the conclusion of the original contract, the need for additional work or modification of existing work will almost always arise.
The legislation of both countries allows the award of a contract for extra work up to a certain limit to the same contractor without the need to publish and carry out a new procurement procedure.
The volume of additional work according to European and German legislation may not exceed 50% of the original value of the contract.
In addition, additional work must be necessary and must be in the nature of a specific part of the main contract.
In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied for the submission of additional work.
This can bring the risk of a longer time delay in the implementation of the contract and the possible incorporation of a new entity into an existing project.
If the overtime contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision which prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified works or overtime.
Calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.
In addition to overtime, there may be fewer jobs during construction, ie work that was not needed.
In the Czech Republic, less and more work cannot be compensated for each other.
Main control findings
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tenders
In rare cases, the specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards, but have in the meantime been replaced by EU standards.
In some cases, the specifications contained data requiring a specific trademark, eg for a public sign resistance system, to prevent water penetration or for noise cladding, although this was not required.
In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.
Quantitative specifications divided into items
In not a single case of control of procurement procedures did the BRH record any non-compliance with the general requirements for the call for tenders for supplies and services according to the quantitative specifications divided into items.
Completeness of specifications
In most of the cases audited, the tender documents were fully drawn up before the call for tenders was issued.
In various cases, however, the documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure to take account of changes in items or timetables.
In rare cases, the tender documentation contained work and supplies whose need was uncertain.
One tender documentation for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.
Division of the contract and criteria for awarding the contract
In many cases, the required justification for not dividing supplies into parts has not been demonstrated.
BRH did not find any shortcomings in the criteria for the evaluation of tenders before the award of the contract.
Inclusion of the names of authorized independent experts
In many documents, interested authorized experts were mentioned.
The names were mentioned on the introductory pages of the documents or on the plans or attached opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact the explicitly appointed architect with their questions about the tender procedure.
In the case of building projects, these cases were found mainly in the tender documents, where self-employed experts were entrusted with the elaboration of the specifications.
The contracting authorities stated that they did not have sufficient staff capacity for a detailed examination of the tender documents.
SAO
Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tenders
In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 apartments, the reference was directly to specific manufacturers and brands of products.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of other similar types of products nor did it justify why it required the delivery of specific products.
In the construction of university facilities, the tender documentation contained references to specific business companies and specific product designations.
General overview of specifications and partial specifications
For the construction of some industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define in the tender documentation the quantity and type of required works, supplies or services in the statement of acreage and determined for each building as a unit of measure only the enclosed space in cubic meters.
Completeness of specifications
During the tender procedure for the public contract for the construction of the ring road, the tender documentation for the restricted procedure was changed four times from August to September 2009.
The reason was changes in the project documentation caused by the extension of the scope of the contract and the change in technical conditions.
In the construction of social facilities, the tender documentation had defects that forced the emergence of additional work (there was no precise focus, there was not enough construction and technical research, there were no drawings).
In the tender documentation for the construction of a large library, the interior elements were mentioned only descriptively, without specifying the qualitative requirements for the products.
The supply of the interior equipment of the building was provided by subcontractors who purchased some above-standard and very expensive equipment.
Parts and criteria for the award of the contract
In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation to award a contract in installments.
The analysis of three large road constructions during the construction of the ring road showed that when they were awarded in an open procedure in parts (separately for selected buildings), it was possible to achieve savings of up to CZK 790 million from the achieved public procurement price of CZK 15,508 million.
For example, when six buildings were awarded as a separate part of the public contract, savings of 62.5 mil.
CZK, ie 25% of the contracted price, and when 20 bridges were awarded as a separate part of the public contract, savings of CZK 287.8 million, ie also 25%, could be achieved.
During the construction of roads, the contracting authority set qualification criteria in the tender documentation, which limited the participation of small suppliers in the tender procedure.
In the tender conditions of the open tender for the contractor for one motorway construction, the contracting authority required, among other things, the contractor's practice of implementing at least three road constructions with a financial volume of more than CZK 700 million, completed or put into operation during the last five years.
There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completing constructions over CZK 700 million in the last five years.
The public contract for the supply of another motorway construction in an open procedure included six separate constructions, for which the contracting authority required a minimum annual volume of construction work in the last three years of CZK 12 billion.
Two thirds of the financial volume of road construction works (ie € 2.5 billion out of € 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008–2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually either in form of consortium.
Of the 46 contracts for a total of CZK 13.2 billion, there were only two or even one bidder.
The SAO pointed out that a reduction in market potential could lead to a large increase in costs.
Area of ​​multiple works
During the construction of the ring road, the contracting authority did not conclude a written contract for the supply of additional work for the construction of the construction in two cases and did not award the additional work to any of the procedures specified in the law.
The value of unapproved extra work in one case was CZK 1,591.4 million excluding VAT (an increase of 21%) and in the other case CZK 4,135.8 million excluding VAT (an increase of 91%).
The reason for the extra work was mainly the ambiguous definition of the amount and type of work required.
In the construction of university facilities, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documentation some works and supplies, the necessity of which for the completion and approval of the construction was already known when awarding the contract.
For these works and supplies, he concluded amendments to the work contract with the construction contractor with an increase in price, in a negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of additional work exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.
In connection with the construction of the Palace of Justice, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional work without a tender procedure.
During the construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by CZK 50.5 million.
The unit prices of the additional works determined without competition were significantly higher than comparable works performed by the same supplier.
Other findings
On a selected sample of constructions, the SAO found that the average construction costs for the construction of one kilometer of a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic are CZK 355.0 million.
According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometer of the four-lane motorway is CZK 260.0 million.
This comparison suggests that the acquisition of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary
The legal provisions concerning the tender dossier are almost identical in both countries and are in line with the requirements of European law.
The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and prevention of corruption.
The specifications must be sufficiently precise to enable interested parties to calculate costs and prepare their tenders.
In addition, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to outsource work.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions on tender documents are complemented by other rules which are intended to further reduce the scope for restricting competition and manipulation.
Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, greater transparency is achieved by publishing award criteria.
In both countries, the requirements for specifications are usually met.
However, in some cases, shortcomings were identified which could lead to a restriction of competition.
The current rule in Germany, which requires the division of large construction projects into parts, seems appropriate to strengthen the competitive environment and achieve cost-effective results.
The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, the award of contracts for large-scale projects without the award of lots or the division into large-scale lots may limit the range of applicants to a small number of large suppliers.
The result of the strict requirement for tenderer references, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of tenderers for road construction work, is the fact that public contracts are awarded only to a small circle of tenderers, and small and medium-sized companies do not have a chance to compete.
The limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price fixing and other illegal conventions.
Regulatory approaches are different in the two countries with regard to the award of additional works contracts or modified works and their remuneration.
If the value of the additional work under European and German law does not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract, the extra work may be awarded without a call for tenders.
In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% applies.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
This limit is often exceeded by the contracting authority.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
If the 20% limit is exceeded, overtime must be awarded on the basis of a new procurement procedure.
By dividing the work into parts, it is possible to avoid restricting competition and the consequent unfortunate consequences.
Determining the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU limits
By determining the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the range of potential suppliers that will be admitted to the competition.
The contracting authority may leave the scope of potential suppliers unlimited, or it may limit the scope according to specified criteria.
In the case of large project works whose value reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, a European procurement procedure must be conducted.
Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of procedure, the contracting authority must comply in particular with the requirements of European law concerning the competitive environment and transparency.
If the estimated total cost of the contract for the required works reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of € 5.0 million (CZK 125 million), an open or restricted tender is always required at European level.
In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue is permissible.
If the construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the European procurement procedure by issuing a national procedure if the total value of the relevant part is below € 1.0 million (CZK 25 million) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the estimated value of the whole contract.
Dividing a construction project or deliberately estimating its costs too low in order to avoid the fundamental obligation to launch a European tender is not permissible.
The choice of the type of proceedings is very important for the prevention of corruption, because restricting competition significantly increases the risk of manipulation.
Therefore, an important part of the tender documentation is a detailed justification of the chosen type of procedure, especially in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented the EU's legal requirements for procurement and limits in their national legislation.
Different provisions
The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures also for procurement procedures at the national level.
Open and restricted procedures can always be chosen, while other types of procedures are allowed only if the conditions stipulated by law are met.
Unlike the Czech legislation, the relevant German legislation on budgetary law and the principles of prevention of corruption prefers open procedures or a public invitation to participate in proceedings.
Other types of proceedings, including restricted proceedings, are permitted only in exceptional cases, if permitted by law.
Such exceptions must be justified and documented.
The principle of open procedure preference is intended to ensure that restrictions of competition are avoided as far as possible and that opportunities for manipulation are limited (pre-selected specific candidates).
In Germany, this principle of public procurement is central to the prevention of corruption.
A correct estimate of the expected contract price is an important basis for deciding on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.
In estimating the costs of building projects, contracting authorities in Germany can rely on the budget and cost databases of public administrations and other organizations.
These have been compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, inter alia, standard cost values ​​for types of construction, building units, building parts and partial construction work.
Based on such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the contract value of a planned project or construction work.
Only a few building administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.
However, the database is expected to be expanded at national level.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects to determine the expected costs of public works contracts.
In many cases, the determination of costs is based on an estimate of the entity that finances the project or on the value of the resources available to that entity.
Standardization measures are still at an early stage.
Based on the anti-corruption program for the period 2011 to 2012, the relevant ministries are to develop a database of usual prices of standardized commodities.
The use of the price system to determine the expected price of the contract is determined by a new regulation ordering the subject of the contract to be specified in detail.
The pricing system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly work, materials and products, and other data in order to calculate the necessary costs and to determine unit prices.
The Ministry of Transport has issued normative prices for transport constructions for the purpose of their control, which are regularly updated.
The database is intended for determining the price of a project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the next stages of preparation of construction work.
The main control findings of BRH
Selection of the tender procedure
The audited contracting authorities generally awarded contracts in an open procedure or in the form of a public call for participation, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.
In 2011, the share of public tenders in the total volume of federal building projects in the field of building construction was 59.5%.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public competition was not sufficiently justified.
In the case of a comprehensive inspection, the BRH found, on the basis of information gathered from more than 16,000 proceedings, that a restricted procedure has a clear disadvantage compared to a public procedure and a public call, and that restricted procedures also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
According to the BRH study, tender prices in restricted and negotiated procedures were 6% to 10% higher than in public procedures.
Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Provincial Audit Office confirmed differences in value for money obtained in public and restricted proceedings.
A study by the Ministry of Construction even found that prices in restricted proceedings were twice as high as prices in public proceedings.
Compliance with EU limits
For projects with a total contract value estimated at more than € 5 million (CZK 125 million), the audited contracting authorities usually prepared procurement plans stating which works would be awarded in the European procurement procedure and which in the national procedure.
According to the tender plans, the share of works awarded in accordance with European rules always exceeded 80% of the total work.
No case of circumvention of the European management requirement has been reported in the form of an excessively low cost estimate.
However, in some cases the minimum share for pan-European management was not reached due to a calculation error.
During the execution of the works, some contracting authorities illegally changed the procurement plan.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of European management would subsequently be respected.
The share of European procedures according to the project accounts was generally lower than the share set out in the tender plan.
If the expected values ​​of construction project contracts exceeded the European limits, the contracting authorities did not apply the European procedure to all individual partial parts in excess of € 1 million (CZK 25 million).
Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure, without giving strong reasons for the need to derogate from the requirement.
SAO
Selection of the type of tender procedure
In the case of several large construction projects (eg construction of a road section, equipment for a major sporting event and construction of flats), the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, although these sub-contracts were of the same or similar nature.
The division reduced the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded in a less demanding regime or even outside the statutory regime.
Methods of calculating the estimated price
Price standards applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for determining the estimated price.
They were based on the prices quoted in the completed proceedings, which, however, were burdened by inefficiencies and excessive profits of suppliers.
The SAO found that the actual prices for the three parts of the ring road were about 37% lower than these price standards.
The Ministry of Transport is to update the standards in relation not only to past prices, but also in comparison with other comparable markets and price developments.
For buildings, the estimated price was based on the project budget made by the architects or the investor's estimate.
The actual price then differed significantly from the estimated price.
The estimated cost of building a large library was twice as high as the contract price, but increased by CZK 54 million, ie by 27%, during implementation.
Similarly, for the construction of the depository of this library, the contract price was 33% lower than the expected price.
In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the expected price and increased even further during implementation.
In the construction of a large library, it was by CZK 400 million, ie by 22%. In the construction of the Palace of Justice, the actual price increased disproportionately during the construction (by 139%) compared to the increase in functional areas (only by 12%).
Summary
Both countries have implemented European provisions on the choice of the type of procurement procedure and on respecting European limits into their national legislation, so that the respective national regulations of both countries are almost identical.
However, the principle of public proceedings in Germany is stricter than the European regulation and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.
Compared to a restricted call for tenders, a public tender or a call for tenders gives more competitors the opportunity to participate in the tender procedure.
These types of tenders generate a large number of bids that guarantee the best value for money effect.
The prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened, as the circle of interested parties is not limited by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, which thus gives room for manipulation and fixation of prices among bidders.
The studies confirmed the benefits of the German provision on the preference for open procedures or public calls for tenders.
Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or restricted procedure.
However, the latest legislation on the Public Procurement Act introduces a ban on contracting authorities to limit the number of tenderers in restricted procedures.
The restricted procedure is now very close to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authority largely complies with the requirement to prefer an open procedure or a public call for competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects were divided in breach of the law in order to circumvent the requirement to select the appropriate type of tender.
However, in the case of some projects implemented in Germany, European limits were not respected, which resulted in the minimum share in pan-European proceedings not being reached.
A satisfactory system has not yet been introduced in the Czech Republic to facilitate the correct calculation of expected costs of construction work and projects.
Where appropriate, contracting authorities should ensure, through more extensive controls, that the requirements for selecting the type of procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are met, or should create the conditions necessary to allow the correct calculation of expected costs. .
Preliminary information and notice of initiation
In cases where contracts are awarded in the framework of a European procedure, the contracting authority must publish a report on the procurement procedure.
Prior information and procurement notices are an important basis for European competition.
Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption
The contracting authority must indicate the basic specifications of the intended projects by means of prior notifications.
Prior notices are required for projects where the total cost estimate is equal to or greater than the European limit and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadline for submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.
The contracting authority is obliged to publish a contract notice with detailed information for all public contracts that require a European procedure.
The information is binding for the contracting authority after publication.
The notification must include, inter alia, the specifications, the time limits for the procedure and for completing the contract, the specific requirements and the selection criteria and their weights.
A common vocabulary for public procurement must be used to describe the subject of the contract.
Preliminary information and contract notices are published in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the contracting authority's profile.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign candidates, notices at national level should not contain any additional information and should not be published before the text of the notification is sent to the Publications Office of the EU.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the pre-notification may distort competition or even facilitate manipulation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented EU provisions on prior information and procurement notices into their national legislation.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published in the case of contracts for which a European procedure is not required.
The procurement procedure may not start earlier than one month after the dispatch of the prior notice.
Disclosure of prior information may be waived only in exceptional cases.
In Germany, prior information is not required in cases where a European procedure is not required.
In the case of national proceedings, the public call must be published on the federal government's website and, where appropriate, in the press.
In the case of restricted procedures without competition from participants, the notice must be published if the estimated price of the contract is equal to or higher than € 25,000 (CZK 625 thousand).
Preliminary notices must explain all planned parts of the project.
This is an important requirement given the number of small contracts in Germany.
Dividing projects into smaller parts is not so common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.
Main control findings
BRH
Prior notice
The contracting authorities published a prior notice of projects which included works to be awarded in a European procedure.
In some open procedures, they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between sending the pre-notification and sending the contract notice was less than 52 days.
In the case of other summary proceedings, the annual deadlines for prior information have expired and should be renewed.
In many cases, the prior notification did not indicate the expected division of the works into several parts.
Notice of the opening of the procurement procedure
Some notifications contained codes from a common dictionary that deviated from the content of the pre-notification or did not specify exactly the work to be carried out.
In rare cases, notices at national level included more information, eg on deadlines, or were published before the notice was published in the Official Journal of the EU.
Ex-ante transparency
One contracting authority hired an external company to publish the national notice.
It published a notice on its platform, the use of which was charged.
However, the contracting authority did not check whether this company had to comply with the requirement to forward the notification to a free internet government portal.
The sample found that only a third of the announcements were actually published on the government portal.
SAO
Notice of the opening of the procurement procedure
During the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not set out in the notice of the restricted tender to the construction contractor the criteria according to which it will reduce the large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure.
The contracting authority was not able to document the method of selection (reduction) of tenders for evaluation.
The reduction in the number of offers was made possible by previous legislation.
During the construction of the ring road, the contracting authority for one construction did not define in the notice of initiation of the restricted procedure or in the qualification documentation the values ​​according to which it will assess the degree of fulfillment of qualification criteria or the number of candidates to be invited.
The contracting authority assessed the fulfillment of the qualification in such a way that all six candidates in the restricted procedure fulfilled it, but excluded one of them, stating that they fulfilled only in the last sixth place.
The contracting authority's procedure was not transparent, as it did not publish information in advance on what of the qualification data will be evaluated and how.
Publication of calls
In violation of the law, the contracting authority did not publish a written invitation to submit tenders for construction modifications in former military districts.
Conclusions and recommendations / summary
A two-stage information process with prior information and publication of a notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the requirements of transparency and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European proceedings.
By extending the obligation to publish prior information in the Czech Republic for national procurement procedures as well, and strengthening this obligation in Germany for limited procedures, both countries have increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.
Selection of candidates in restricted procedures
Unlike open procedures, restricted procedures do not allow all potential tenderers to participate.
In restricted procedures, the contracting authority first selects potential suppliers who will be asked to submit a tender.
Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption
EU provisions allow limiting the number of applicants in European restricted procedures.
However, the restricted procedure requires at least five tenderers who will be invited to submit a tender, and in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential tenderers must be invited.
In any case, the number of candidates invited must be wide enough to guarantee real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.
The selection of potential candidates who will be invited is very prone to manipulation, eg by the preferences of some of them.
Reducing competition to a few bidders can facilitate their collusion.
This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.
Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and ensure that it has effective control so that this procedure is transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The provisions for the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the requirements of the European Directive, contracting authorities should vary the tenders they invite to submit a tender.
It is also not permissible to restrict competition from a regional point of view.
Contracting authorities must document and justify the selection of tenderers and the selection process.
Different provisions
In Germany, at least three candidates are required to be invited in the case of a restricted procedure and several suitable candidates in the case of a negotiated procedure.
With the exception of two cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow limiting the number of candidates addressed in the case of restricted and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the "four eyes" principle must be respected when selecting candidates.
While one worker proposes a list of them, another must substantially modify the proposal, eg by deleting the proposed candidate or substituting another.
This is to prevent a situation where an individual can definitively determine the circle of candidates who will take part in the procedure.
In the absence of such a provision, far-reaching illegal agreement between the participants is possible.
The list of candidates who will be invited to submit a tender must be confidential and must not be disclosed.
Authorized independent experts are also obliged to do so.
There is no similar measure or measure for the confidential treatment of the list of candidates in the Czech Republic.
According to German provisions, they may not nominate candidates from an external company, but may make proposals to the contracting authority.
There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.
Main control findings
BRH
Number of applicants
Except for a few cases, the requirement to address the minimum number of applicants was met.
The analysis of almost 7,000 contracts for constructions with a value up to the national limit showed that in the case of limited procedures, the contracting authorities invited an average of 6.6 potential bidders and in the case of direct negotiated procedures on average 4.4 bidders.
Change of suppliers and regional restrictions
The contracting authorities, especially in the area of ​​building construction, did not change the circle of candidates addressed, as they had good experience with those with whom they had worked so far.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of a closed procedure, they should ensure that they contact candidates whose suitability they have already ascertained in advance.
Although there was no evidence of illegal regional restrictions, the circle of candidates in a closed procedure included a larger proportion of regional candidates than in the case of public proceedings.
The contracting authorities explained this by the low amount of the contract compared to the public tender and the high travel costs for potential tenderers.
The principle of cross-checking and proposals of self-employed professionals
The contracting authorities mostly ignored the obligation to change the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.
They argued in particular for lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable candidate.
In many cases, it was not clear from the records who proposed the candidate who had been asked to take part in the procedure.
An inspection of some samples showed that the list of potential candidates was drawn up by self-employed experts and accepted by the contracting authority without changes.
Thus, the contracting authorities did not sufficiently protect themselves from potential manipulation.
Confidentiality of treatment of lists of potential candidates
For one contracting authority, a list of candidates for invitations to tender was kept in a database to which all employees had access at any time.
This allowed the manipulation or unauthorized disclosure of the names of the candidates expected or accepted, who could then agree on a price.
Documentation
The documentation stated the reasons for the selection of candidates in only a few cases.
SAO
Criteria for selection of candidates
During the construction of the ring road, those interested did not have information on what from the data on their qualifications will be evaluated and in what way.
For the action related to the development and modernization of waterways and ports, the criteria for limiting the number of tenderers were not set out in the contract notice for participation in the restricted procedure.
All eight tenderers met the qualification requirements, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority limited participation in the tender procedure.
The Commission then selected candidates at random - by drawing lots, which was legal at the time.
This procedure should have been mentioned as a criterion in the tender notice.
Summary
In view of the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning tenderer in restricted procedures, both countries have introduced special measures to prevent unlawful restrictions of competition.
German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by means of so-called cross-checking (four-eyes principle), by maintaining the confidentiality of the list of candidates and by prohibiting proposals for the selection of candidates from outside companies.
The Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of applicants.
However, the audit found that some of these rules were not sufficiently applied and that inadmissible restrictions on the number of candidates were not prevented in some cases.
Contracting authorities are obliged to completely eliminate the mentioned shortcomings.
Submission of bids
The procurement phase, in which potential tenderers may prepare tenders on the basis of the tender dossier they have received, begins with the publication of information on the procurement procedure and / or a call for tenderers.
Until the date of opening the envelopes, potential tenderers may submit their tenders to the contracting authority, thus bidding for the contract.
Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption
EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.
The contracting authority must follow the national regulations governing this phase of the procedure and prevent potential manipulation.
These regulations apply in particular to the organization and control.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The principle applies that tender documents, on the basis of which potential suppliers prepare their bids, must always be sent by the contracting authority.
Design offices that are interested in management should not fulfill this role.
The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates receive the same information during this phase of the procurement procedure.
In case of ambiguities in the tender documentation or if other questions arise, only the contracting authority may provide information to the tenderers.
The design offices responsible for drawing up the tender dossier may not provide any information.
Throughout this phase, any contact between the design office and the tenderers must be avoided.
They must remain anonymous throughout, as allowing contact with them may adversely affect competition.
Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically submitted bids must be encrypted.
Different provisions
In Germany, the contracting authority may entrust insured suppliers of external services with the printing and distribution of documentation, and their staff must be bound by professional secrecy.
In Germany, tenders received must be marked with the date of receipt and handed over directly and immediately in their original state (sealed) to the official in charge of their storage.
This staff member must not be involved in the procurement procedure.
Received bids must be locked until the date the envelopes are opened.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a serial number.
The contracting authority issues a report with data on the tender, including the number of the tender and information on the preparation of the tender and its receipt.
There are no special regulations on the safekeeping of tenders.
Main control findings
BRH
BRH checked the assignment of the administrative building.
Sending tender documentation
The inspected contracting authorities of the construction administration sent the tender documentation either directly or entrusted its printing and distribution to an external company.
The self-employed did not send any documentation.
Information provided to candidates
In the part of the tender documentation concerning inquiries and obtaining information, the contracting authority did not follow the rule for separate planning from the tender procedure.
Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not mention the names of his contact staff in the documentation, but rather the staff of the project management department.
Some notices in the tender procedure even contained the names of companies or self-employed persons who participated in the preparation of the tender dossier.
In rare cases, candidates who asked questions during the procurement procedure did not receive identical information.
Labeling of offers
For contracting authorities, all accepted tenders were stamped and acknowledged of receipt.
However, in some cases in the negotiated procedure, bids were accepted by self-employed professionals, in breach of the one-stop-corruption rule.
Custody of the tenders
Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.
For one contracting authority, tenders were temporarily placed in an open filing cabinet, to which all employees had access.
Another contracting authority placed the box in the hallway without constant supervision, and part of the bids thrown in the box remained there overnight.
The mailbox opening was wide and unsecured, making it accessible not only to employees.
SAO
The SAO did not find any shortcomings in this area.
Summary
In both countries, rules are laid down to prevent contacts, in particular between the companies involved and the design offices cooperating in the procurement procedure, throughout the process.
Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all candidates.
Rules for the prevention of manipulation and corruption are appropriate for the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of offers.
In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more elaborated than in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the accumulated control records showed breaches of the rules in some areas.
These discrepancies can be easily remedied.
Opening envelopes
Opening envelopes
During the opening of the envelopes, the offers that have been closed so far are opened, their content is read and published.
The period for which the tenderer is bound by his tender begins at the end of the deadline for submission of envelopes or their opening and ends with the deadline specified by the contracting authority.
Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption
European legislation does not contain any specific provisions dealing with the opening of envelopes.
However, national laws and regulations contain extensive requirements for the protection of bids and competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement process.
The principles of "more eyes", transparency and credibility of the process of opening the envelopes are intended to prevent manipulations and modifications to the tenders already submitted.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The envelopes must be opened by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.
Compliance with the "more eyes" principle is intended to prevent individuals from covertly manipulating offers.
Candidates may be present when the envelopes are opened.
When opening, all envelopes must be placed in front of the chairman of the commission and are opened one after the other.
Late bids may not be considered.
To ensure transparency when opening the envelopes, this phase, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing. The record must include, among other things, the names of the tenderers and the prices offered.
The minutes must be read and signed by the group leader.
The minutes may also be signed by the candidates present.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, a commission is being set up to open envelopes.
The participation of independent experts is allowed.
The members of the commission may also be entrusted with the discussion in the subsequent stages of the procedure, ie the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, the envelopes are opened in the presence of the manager and the recorder.
The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.
The manager and, in the case of building construction, the recorder may not be participants in the preparatory phase (creation of tender documentation), may not decide on the award of the contract and may not be members in the subsequent processing (management) of the contract.
German regulations require that the record of the opening of envelopes contain not only the offer prices, but also all information on discounts and special (unusual) signs, such as damaged envelopes upon receipt or late arrivals.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer prices, the registration must also contain information on the language of the offer and the tenderer's signature authorization.
German regulations require that all parts of the envelopes to be opened be marked in order to prevent subsequent changes.
Tenders, usually marked in the form of a perforation with the date, must be kept confidential after the opening of the envelopes has been closed and may only be made available to persons who further process them.
There are no similar measures in the Czech Republic.
If a single tender is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be opened and the tenderer must be notified immediately.
In Germany, they do not have this arrangement, and if a single tender is accepted, it is opened and evaluated.
Main control findings
BRH
Principle of cross-checking
During the opening of the envelopes, the contracting authorities followed the principle of four eyes.
The leader and recorder, who was not assigned a different role, were always present.
In rare cases, however, in small negotiated procedures, natural persons opened tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Envelope opening process
the notes from the opening of the envelopes did not always document the course.
In some cases, late tenders were not marked and in some cases signatures were missing.
Marking of received offers
The contracting authorities marked the offers of perforations with a date, which was in accordance with the requirements.
Some of them in the past marked the offers incorrectly, but after notifying the BRH they changed their practice.

SAO
Deadline for submission of tenders
During road repairs, in one event, the tenderer's offer was handed over to the contracting authority with a one-month delay, which he nevertheless accepted.
Summary
Substantial parts of the provisions on the opening of envelopes are identical in both countries with regard to the principle of "more eyes" and the principle of transparency, and thus make it possible to substantially reduce the risk of corruption and manipulation.
The German rules are more complex in comparison with the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for accurate documentation of the procedure.
Marking, safe storage and respect for the confidentiality of tenders significantly limit the possibility of subsequent changes in the tenders submitted.
In addition, the staff responsible for opening the envelopes may not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.
The findings, despite the detection of some irregularities, confirm that the rules for opening envelopes are largely applied.
Assessment and evaluation of offers
The contracting authority must examine and evaluate the tenders received within the deadline.
At the same time, they must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.
Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption
EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating tenders in several steps:
The first step is to check the suitability of the candidates.
They must have a good economic and financial position and the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.
Candidates who have ever been convicted of bribery or fraud must always be excluded from the procurement procedure.
Tenders of non-excluded tenderers must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published award criteria.
The contracting authority must determine the most economically advantageous tender and, in particular, examine all significantly low price tenders.
Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and prone to manipulation.
For example, tenderers may be excluded without a valid reason, or tenders that do not meet the requirements may be left in the competition.
The result of the evaluation may be incorrectly affected by the preference or disadvantage of a tenderer, which may prevent the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.
The contracting authority must therefore take special measures in selecting the persons involved in the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements of good repute and technical knowledge.
It must also make sure that the whole process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require a review and evaluation of tenders in successive steps.
During the evaluation, the requirements for proving the suitability of candidates, the evaluation criteria and their weights stated in the notice or in the tender dossier may not be changed.
The criteria set for assessing the suitability of candidates may no longer be used.
Further evaluation can only be performed on the basis of evaluation criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be formally examined to see whether they are complete or whether they do not contain suspicious elements that could encourage manipulation.
If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of the tenders submitted by them, they must be informed immediately.
If the evaluation of tenders results in a disproportionately low tender price, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation before any tender is rejected.
The reasons for the decision must be transparently documented.
Different provisions
In Germany, tenderers must maintain confidentiality and only eligible persons may take part in the evaluation of tenders.
The mathematical accuracy of the tenders may only be checked by the contracting authority.
Only employees who are not involved in the decision-making phase of the supplier selection or in the project implementation phase can be entrusted with the evaluation.
There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.
If external companies are commissioned to review and evaluate tenders, they must be aware that tenders are confidential and honestly respect this fact.
They can only make proposals for decisions to the contracting authority.
In the Czech Republic, tenders must be reviewed and evaluated by a commission appointed by the contracting authority, which will draw up a report proposing the conclusion of the contract.
However, in both countries, the final decision depends on the contracting authority.
If, in Germany, the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
If tenderers do not comply with this obligation, their tenders must be excluded.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority can decide whether to give the tenderer the opportunity to complete the missing documents.
If the tenderer does not provide them, he must be expelled.
In Germany, it is necessary to review not only the total price but also the unit prices.
If the price structure of the tender shows that the prices for parts of the overall project have been estimated disproportionately high or low, tenderers must be asked for an explanation.
If they do not provide explanations and if the contracting authority can prove that the tender contains compensatory prices, such tenders must be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from submitting price calculations on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to individual parts of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.
In the Czech Republic, the total price of the work is evaluated and the prices of individual parts are not examined in detail.
Valuation compensation is not a reason to exclude a bid.
In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer offering a disproportionately high or low price.
If one or more tenders differ in price by 10% or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from other tenders, tenderers must prove that their tender has been credibly and convincingly calculated.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.
In the Czech Republic, the tender procedure may be canceled after a price review if only tenders with disproportionately low prices have been received and the tenderers have not substantiated these prices.
If the price of the tender is significantly higher than the contracting authority's estimate, this is not a reason for refusing to award the contract to the tenderer concerned (unlike the German contracting law).
If there is a suspicion in Germany of conduct intended to restrict competition, the contracting authority is obliged to report this fact immediately to the competent superior authority.
He must decide on the further procedure and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust authority or law enforcement authorities.
It must also approve (eg when the contract exceeds € 50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest bidder) whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is negotiated or whether the procurement procedure is canceled.
Czech rules do not regulate this area.
Main control findings
BRH
Checking suitability and award criteria
Most of the procurement procedures examined complied with the relevant requirements.
In the case of some recommendations from potential suppliers made by self-employed persons, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the tenderers themselves.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
In some procurement cases, insufficient documentation was provided as to whether the contracting authority took into account all published evaluation criteria or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.
Selection of interested parties and confidentiality of tenders
Some contracting authorities used the services of unauthorized persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of building authorities.
They were involved in the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions that were to be performed exclusively by the contracting authority.
The contracting authorities sought to substantiate this fact with their insufficient human resources in the sector.
In some cases, self-employed professionals used the services of persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to exercise due diligence to fulfill their obligations under the contract.
As far as contracting authorities are concerned, as a rule, there was no conclusive evidence as to whether tenders in the custody of self-employed professionals were available only to designated persons.
Review and mathematical control of tenders
Some contracting authorities handed over open envelopes for further verification to self-employed professionals without first carrying out the prescribed examination of tenders and mathematical examination and without documenting the results of these inspections.
In the event of any intention to manipulate, third parties may have made changes to the tenders which could not be identified by the contracting authority.
Examination of the documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the tenders were not adequately identified or where price and product data were missing.
Performance audits
A sample check of one contracting authority revealed that in 75% of procurement cases, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10% from the estimated costs.
One of the twenty tenders was canceled due to inadequate tender prices.
In many cases, there was a lack of records or sufficient documentation on the examination of tenders or on negotiations with tenderers for further clarification.
In many cases, detailed information was also missing, eg on unit prices of the most important invoiced items.
Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often cited as reasons for deviations.
Contracting authorities have argued that it is difficult to identify and prove countervailing prices.
In the case of one call for tenders made by an entity outside the scope of the normal contracting authorities, a 66% lower price was offered compared to the original cost estimate.
Data on a closer examination of costs or on the reasons for deviations were not recorded.
In clarifying this issue, the contracting authority did not find any indication of price dumping for the tenderer to whom the contract might be awarded.
It was therefore not clear whether the original cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.
Later, the contracting authority rated this bidder as a "low-cost company" that was unable to meet either the quality requirements or the deadlines.
In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35% higher than the original cost estimate.
The contracting authority did not cancel the tender procedure and put forward an unfounded argument that it could be assumed that the tenderer did not base its pricing on disproportionately high costs.
Suspected irregularities
Two cases of irregularities were found at one contracting authority, and these were reported to the company responsible for technical supervision.
In one tender procedure, two tenderers submitted tenders containing an identical price calculation, which led the contracting authority to exclude both tenders.
The inspections did not reveal any significant deficiencies in the application of other provisions.
SAO
Verification of suitability
For many construction projects, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from participating in the tender procedure, even though they did not meet the contracting authority's requirements set out in the tender conditions or provided the required qualification or or explain the reason for the exclusion of the candidate who met the requirements.
Evaluation
In the case of the construction of a wastewater treatment plant, the individual evaluation criteria of the tender procedure for the construction contractor were set, but the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.
For the action in the field of railway infrastructure development, the weights of the evaluation criteria were not set at the beginning of the management when awarding the contract, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.
For the road repair project, the assessment of the "shortening construction time" criterion was not carried out correctly.
For the second and third place tenderers, a greater reduction in construction time was incorrectly mentioned in the evaluation than was indicated in their tenders.
Documentation of the reasons for the selection of the candidate
For three events related to housing support, the contracting authority did not document on the basis of which criteria it assessed the accepted offers and how it selected the most suitable one.
The correctness of the selection of suppliers of small-scale contracts associated with the construction of the ring road with an estimated price of up to 500 thousand.
CZK could not be verified, as the suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on the price and date of performance, but documents on these negotiations were not prepared.
Summary
In both countries, the rules for verifying and evaluating tenders comply with EU requirements.
However, they differ with regard to the specific management steps and the selection of individuals involved in the proceedings.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, in Germany these steps in the procurement process are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially as regards the application of the cross-principle and the protection of tenders.
The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.
In both countries, in some cases of inspections, it was found that the essential steps of the process in verifying and evaluating tenders were not documented at all and, if so, only partially.
The absence of control tools and transparency in decision-making during the examination and evaluation of tenders allows manipulation.
The inspections revealed serious defects, such as the transmission of tenders to third parties without prior proper verification and documentation of the tenders by the contracting authority.
Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of functions related to the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased control of measures against increased possibilities for manipulation are necessary.
In all cases, the audited German contracting authorities did not use the complete set of available tools when checking the eligibility of prices and did not deal with their own price structure.
In the Czech Republic, shortcomings were found in the evaluation of the suitability of tenders and the use of evaluation criteria.
Completion of the tender procedure
After reviewing and evaluating the tenders, the procurement process is completed by awarding the contract or canceling the procedure.
Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption
In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the award decision.
Suppliers shall have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request a review, if appropriate.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
The period of 10 days applies to electronic submission and 15 days to other submissions.
The contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this period or before the decision of the review procedure.
If the review body rejects the complaint and upholds the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the exercise of the award right reviewed by an independent court.
This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by the swift implementation of procurement decisions.
The contracting authority must duly document the course of the procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have implemented management information obligations.
In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.
However, it cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly performed verification and evaluation.
The contracting authority is to conclude the contract within the specified time.
The reason is the fact that the tenderer is not bound by his tender after this deadline.
The content of the contract must not deviate from the winning bid.
Unsuccessful tenderers should be informed of the result in good time, stating the reason why their tender has not been accepted.
Cancellation of the tender procedure is permissible only if certain conditions are met, eg if the prices in the tenders do not correspond to the specifications.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period of 10 or 15 days before concluding a contract applies to both European and national proceedings.
In Germany, the equivalent provision only applies to European proceedings.
In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of a contract before a decision on its EU provision and a review has been made.
In the Czech Republic, the tender procedure must be canceled if a single tender has been received or only one tender has met the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.
In Germany, a contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that this tender meets the conditions set out in the tender dossier and is cost-effective.
Main control findings
BRH
The inspections found few inconsistencies in the completion of the audited procurement processes.
In some cases in European proceedings, companies authorizing letters were received before the expiry of the notification period, which may invalidate the contract.
Also in several cases of open procedures, the letters of authority contained modifications incompatible with the content of the tender, such as new deadlines.
In some cases, contracting authorities did not meet the deadlines for the award of the contract.
In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because the tenderer offering a price more than 50% lower no longer wished to fulfill the contract at the price originally offered.
SAO
During the reconstruction and construction of the university, in one case the contracting authority did not conclude a work contract with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the tender of the selected tenderer.
For some road repairs, road construction, motorway and ring road projects, contracts were concluded later than required by law.
In the case of construction modifications in former military districts, the contracting authority sent a notice of the selection of the most suitable tender to all tenderers only after the expiry of the legal deadline.
Summary
Both countries have implemented EU rules on the termination of procurement procedures.
Legal protection of unsuccessful candidates helps to reduce corruption.
The Czech Public Procurement Act includes the institute of legal protection even in cases of contracts below EU limits.
In both countries, it was found that the limited time limit for concluding the contract was exceeded.
This can have adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, contracting authorities should eliminate such shortcomings when closing a procurement procedure.
Documentation, notifications, information obligations
The procurement process, with all its various stages, relevant findings and decisions, including the relevant justifications, must be documented in a transparent manner.
Completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.
Data on procurement procedures are summarized in EU statistics.
Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption
The obligation to document the procurement procedure is in line with the basic requirement of the principle of transparency, applied at EU level.
Only proper and time-relevant documentation on decision-making and justification guarantees transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds European limits.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to give detailed reasons for individual decisions and their justification significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
In the case of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify their completion to the EU’s Office of Official Publications within 48 days of the date of award of the contract.
The Office publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU and thus fulfills the requirement of transparency.
The contracting authority must summarize the essential details of its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission publishes annual statistics, which provide an overview of the development of the single market in construction.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully transposed the provisions of the European Law on Documentation and Notification Obligations into their national legislation.
The provisions on documentation and notification for European statistics are almost identical in both countries.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the award of a contract applies not only to European procedures but also to national procedures.
The notice period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.
In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those which are mandatory under European law, applies only to limited procedures exceeding the limit of 25 thousand. € (625 thousand CZK) and direct proceedings exceeding the limit of 15 thousand CZK € (375 thousand CZK) including VAT.
Only participants in the proceedings are informed below this limit.
Main control findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of assignments were not fully documented.
The notification did not contain all the necessary information, such as the reasons for the supply specifications and national rules.
In one case, the contracting authority did not explain why it had concluded a contract with a tenderer whose tender did not contain the required particulars.
In several cases, some required records were also missing.
Publication of the award of the contract
In some European proceedings, the contracting authority erred in publishing the notice.
In the case of several entries, there was no evidence of publication of the notice.
Notification obligation
The statistically validated files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent on time.
Preliminary transparency
In most cases, the contracting authority published information on the outcome of the contract.
In the case of one contracting authority, the contract information was not disclosed due to a communication error.
It took the contracting authority half a year to notice the errors.
As a result, the outcome of the proceedings was not disclosed during this period.
SAO
Documentation
For events related to the organization of a major sporting event, significant deficiencies were found in the documentation on the course of the tender procedure, such as incorrect data on bid prices in the minutes of the evaluation committee meeting.
In addition, some documents on the opening of the envelopes were not signed.
Publication of the award of the contract
In the preparation of repairs and maintenance of roads, construction of the motorway and the ring road, the contract award notice was sent after the deadline or was not published.
Summary
The provisions on documentation and notification and notification obligations include European requirements and are almost identical in both countries.
This generally ensures the transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.
The Czech reporting obligations are somewhat stricter compared to the German ones.
The inspections revealed shortcomings that significantly reduced the value of documentation as a means of preventing corruption.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
Contracting authorities should further enhance the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with the notification and notification requirements.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the SAO and the BRH were focused on two areas that are essential for the public procurement process in both the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.
EU legislation provides an opportunity for international competition within the EU to create a single European market.
The aim of measures to prevent corruption is not only to avoid or at least reduce it, but also to prevent financial damage and possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the government.
The findings of the audit institutions of both audit institutions - the SAO and the BRH - with regard to the application of the procurement law of both countries and the comparison of its respective provisions give an internal view of common and different elements that may help both countries in further development and application of this law.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries have transposed EU public procurement law into their national legislation.
In both countries, there is thus an important common basis for public procurement and meeting the basic requirements of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.
Contracting authorities reinforce these requirements in part with very extensive measures.
The Czech Republic has applied the provisions on public procurement requiring European procedures to procedures that are below EU limits and are therefore governed by national legislation.
However, inspections have shown that contracting authorities do not always fully comply with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.
German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate these inconsistencies, taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, inspections identified risks affecting economy and value for money.
In particular, the incomplete definition of the subject of the public contract, which resulted in additional work that was often awarded in violation of the law, insufficient definition of the estimated price and the required qualifications to narrow the possible circle of bidders and thus reduce competition, especially in transport construction.
Corruption prevention
The joint inspections were not aimed at detecting cases of corruption.
The reason was that the BRH and the SAO do not have sufficient tools for this.
However, they can examine whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to reduce corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are being applied.
Regarding corruption prevention, the two countries focused on different aspects.
Above all, the German provisions leave room for wide and unrestricted competition, transparency and controls as a central element in preventing corruption.
Czech regulations primarily aim at strengthening the transparency of procurement procedures.
BRH
In Germany, there are general principles for the prevention of corruption, which apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles have also been incorporated into public procurement requirements and have been adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.
The relevant provisions specify, sometimes even very precisely, the ways in which the requirements for the prevention of corruption during the procurement procedure and for the selection of persons included in it are met.
In the opinion of the BRH, the principle of preference for open tenders and calls for participation is a particularly suitable tool for significantly reducing the risk of corruption in public procurement, while restricting competition increases the risk of manipulation.
Risk analysis and adequate control (especially the principle of cross-checking), transparency requirements, tender documentation and various organizational measures are also effective mechanisms for preventing corruption and manipulation.
Therefore, BRH does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions, which public institutions must comply with when awarding public contracts.
Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.
Irregularities found in some areas highlighted weaknesses in complying with certain requirements.
Therefore, contracting authorities should provide their employees with further training to familiarize them with anti-corruption requirements and further increase their awareness in this area.
A significant part of the identified weaknesses relates to activities that the construction administration has delegated to private entrepreneurs.
However, the absence of adequate controls in the delegation of powers increases the risk of their abuse.
Activities prone to manipulation and corruption should therefore be outsourced to third parties only if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorized interference.
SAO
In the Czech Republic, anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at the governmental level, which also significantly affect the area of ​​public procurement.
The SAO's audits took place at a time when one of the most important parts of this strategy had been implemented, namely a significant amendment to the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of related implementing regulations.
The adopted strategy and new legislation can be effective steps to improve the situation.
Under the new regulations, for example, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the public contract, the determination of the estimated value of the public contract, the adequacy of qualification requirements, the determination of basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of tenders.
Recommendation
Overall, both the SAO and the BRH have a favorable opinion on how to implement EU requirements.
Their widespread application in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements for competition, equal treatment and transparency form an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.
The transnational model introduced in the EU can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.
Taking into account the great potential of material and intangible damages resulting from manipulation and corruption in connection with the award of public contracts, the BRH and the SAO insist that it is the duty of contracting authorities to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and improve them where possible.
In particular, the organizational structures and processes of procurement procedures should be continuously monitored for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for corrective action and to respond appropriately.
In comparison with the practice in Germany, it turned out that the share of open tenders in the Czech Republic should increase, which gives room to competition and significantly reduces the possibility of corrupt behavior.
Partial procurement can also have a positive impact on the price achieved, where this is permissible and appropriate for the contracting authority. A higher number of bidders puts pressure on the price achieved.
Ensuring its organization also has an impact on the course of the procurement procedure.
In Germany, it is provided by special state organizations, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport constructions, it is organized by central authorities themselves or through contracted organizations.
Both the SAO and the BRH wish to further develop knowledge in their work where appropriate, and to address it with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.
In addition, they are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as these principles and findings are of general importance for effectively combating corruption and guaranteeing that public contracts are awarded in a well-functioning and fair competition regime and that value for money is achieved.

JOINT FINAL REPORT on the results of parallel inspections of the administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic
Joint final report
May 2017
The Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic
Foreword
The presented joint report informs about the course and result of international cooperation in parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on the administration of excise duties in 2012–2015.
Cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of both countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO SR and the SAO CR in the performance of parallel controls focused on the administration of excise duties, which was concluded in August 2015.
The topic of parallel controls was chosen on the basis of the fact that both EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to find out how it is applied at the national level, how the excise administration system is set up and how the systems in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic are different.
The greatest benefit of the inspections carried out was the exchange of experiences, the identification of differences and the identification of good practice.
Last but not least, the benefit was that the international comparability of data on the efficiency and effectiveness of excise administration is very limited without the implementation of parallel controls.

on the results of parallel inspections of the SPD administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic
Summary and evaluation
The legal regulation of excise duties in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic and their administration is in accordance with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.
Differences were found between the adjustment of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic; in the Czech Republic, verification of the economic stability of applicants for permits and mandatory marking and coloring of selected mineral oils and some other oils contributes to the effective administration of excise duties; In the Slovak Republic, the distribution of control stamps is simpler than in the Czech Republic and is less burdensome for the tax administrator.
In the fight against excise tax evasion, the supervision of the movement of raw tobacco, resp. tobacco raw materials, implementation of the institute of fuel distributor and registration of sellers of consumer packaging of alcohol.
Revenues from excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic are growing more slowly than other tax revenues.
The EU's goals of reducing labor taxation, introducing eco-saving measures and reducing tobacco and alcohol dependence have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, partly because excise tax rate indexation has not been introduced in both countries.
This results in a reduction in the importance of excise duties on total tax revenues and, as a result of growing purchasing power, a real reduction in the tax burden on excise duties.
The introduction of environmental measures has been financially supported by the state for a long time, but these measures have a negative impact on excise tax revenues, which will have to be replaced in the future by other revenues or reductions in state expenditures.
Administrative expenditures on the administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have been growing for a long time, mainly due to wage growth, and their efficiency is declining.
In the Slovak Republic, this efficiency is also negatively affected by expenditures on the electronic administration of excise duties (IT expenditures) and expenditures on wages of employees performing permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol.
The electronic administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic did not have a significant effect on reducing the number of tax administrators.
The SAO CR and the SAO SR recommend the FR SR to reconsider the justification for the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol.
In the Czech Republic, the efficiency of administrative expenditures was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures in the audited period that would lead to a reduction in the personnel intensity of the excise tax administration.
The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in individual years of the audited period was similar, while the number of comparable tax entities in the Slovak Republic is about a third lower than in the Czech Republic.
Tax administrators in the Slovak Republic perform administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical performance of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis.
The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is more administratively demanding than in the Czech Republic and, due to the ratio of the number of tax acts to the number of entities, also more expensive.
The electronic administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.
In the Slovak Republic, the administration of excise tax returns is fully electronic, in the Czech Republic, documents proving the taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are submitted electronically.
Both methods of electronic support support the effective administration of excise duties, and therefore the SAO CR and the SAO SR recommend applying them not only in both countries.
The total expenditures for the implementation of the EMCS system could not be compared, as the FR SR provided data on expenditures only for the system upgrade in the period 2011–2015, but the expenditures were also incurred before this period.
Expenditures incurred in the mentioned period only for the upgrade of EMCS in the Slovak Republic were about 20% higher than expenditures incurred in the Czech Republic both for the introduction of EMCS and for the upgrade of this system in more than ten years.
Excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic did not achieve comparable values ​​of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditures.
The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in the Slovak Republic the administration of excise duties is significantly more resource-intensive.
The introduction of the electronic system for monitoring the movement of products subject to excise duty (EMCS) has made the administration of excise duties more efficient, but to a lesser extent in the Slovak Republic, as significantly higher expenditures were incurred on the introduction and modernization of the system than in the Czech Republic.
Basic information
The co-operation of both control institutions took place on the basis of the Agreement on Co-operation in the performance of parallel controls focused on the administration of excise duties dated 18 August 2015.
The SAO CR and the SAO SR have agreed to carry out parallel inspections, which will be primarily focused on the issue of excise tax administration and the results of which will enable analysis, mutual comparison and evaluation of the findings.
Common audit questions were agreed on which the parallel controls were based.
Characteristics of the subject and goals of parallel control:
The aim of the parallel audits was to compare the performance of excise administrators, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify weaknesses in the excise administration process.
In particular, the following main audit questions were to be answered:
Did the excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic achieve comparable values ​​of qualitative indicators while incurring comparable expenditures?
Has the introduction of the electronic Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) streamlined the administration of excise duties and has the costs of implementing it been spent effectively?
The performed parallel inspections were to identify the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, especially in the area of ​​legislation and the setting of the organizational structure.

Legislation for excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
Excise tax administration legislation is divided into the level of EU legislation (see Annex 1) and the level of national legislation (see Annex 2).
Council Directive 2008/118 / EC, on the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12 / EEC, defines excise duty and lays down basic rules for the administration of taxes and for the treatment of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
This directive makes it possible to impose consumption taxes on other products as well.
EU legislation regulates in particular the minimum conditions for: the level of tax rates for individual types of selected products, production, storage, processing and holding of taxable products, tax liability, tax exemptions and refunds, supervision of transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and maintenance of registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.
EU legislation allows for the establishment of control procedures and institutes at national level, provided that they do not distort competition.
Excise tax legislation in the Czech Republic
Definition of legal regulations in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the legal regulation of excise duties is concentrated in the Act on Excise Duties (Act No. 353/2003 Coll.), Which regulates the administration of taxes on mineral oils, taxes on alcohol, taxes on tobacco products, taxes on beer, taxes on wine and intermediate products. and taxes on raw tobacco.
This law defines the forms of handling products subject to excise duty, taxpayers, permitting procedures, conditions for the transport of products, tax returns and sanctions for violations of legal regulations.
The Act and related decrees further regulate some other conditions for the handling of mineral oils (labeling of mineral oils), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and storage of raw tobacco for purposes other than tobacco production.
Taxes on other energy products (ie natural gas and some other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in sections 45 to 47 of Act No. 261/2007 Coll., On the stabilization of public budgets.
In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the administration of excise duties are also contained in special legal regulations. Fuel Act No. 311/2006 Coll. and the implementing regulation regulate the conditions for the sale, issue, distribution of fuels and keeping records of fuels released for free tax circulation.
Act No. 61/1997 Coll., On alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for the production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of alcohol.
Act No. 307/2013 Coll., On mandatory labeling of alcohol, and relevant implementing regulations stipulate mandatory labeling of alcohol in consumer packaging, conditions for handling control tapes and conditions for handling alcohol (ie for production, processing, sale or other transfer , transport, transportation, storage, acceptance, use, holding, import or export of alcohol).
Procedures for tax proceedings, which are not specified in special regulations, are regulated by Act No. 280/2009 Coll., The Tax Code.
Sanctions are imposed in accordance with Act No. 500/2004 Coll., Administrative Procedure Code.
Conditions for issuing a trade license (concession) to operate the trade "production and processing of fuels and lubricants and distribution of fuels" and "production, processing and sale of fermented alcohol, potable alcohol and spirits" are regulated by Act No. 455/1991 Coll., On trade licensing (Trade Licensing Act).
The Czech Republic has used the power to introduce control procedures and institutes for the control of transport of selected products in free tax circulation and for supervising compliance with legal regulations in the handling of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid, as well as in the handling of selected products for which tax has already been taken away.
These include monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and raw tobacco, the labeling of some other mineral oils, the labeling of tobacco products and alcohol in consumer packaging.
The Czech Republic has used the right to apply excise duty to other products and has introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.
Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Czech Republic
Based on the Resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic of 3 October 2012 No. 735, on the implementation of the “Zero Tolerance Plan for the Black Market in Spirits”, major legislative changes were made in the Czech Republic in 2012–2015, introducing a number of measures against tax fraud on excise duty on alcohol.
In the same period, there were also fundamental changes in the legislation on the tax on mineral oils, the tax on tobacco products and the criminalization of the preparation of tax cuts.
Criminal law protection of tax revenues
With effect from 1 July 2016, the criminal offense of preparing the crime of "reduction of tax, fee and similar mandatory payment" is introduced. The amendment made should enable police authorities to take more effective and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, such as the deployment of operational investigative measures.
General provisions of the administration of excise duties
With effect from 1 January 2015, the issuance of a permit for the handling of products subject to excise duty pursuant to the Act on Excise Duties is conditional on: reliability; debtlessness; economic stability; the authorization to operate a trade enabling the pursuit of an authorization-related activity; situations where the petitioner is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.
The aim of the legal regulation was mainly to solve the problem of the occurrence of tax arrears, namely by reducing the entities authorized to dispose of products subject to excise duty taxation.
The condition of economic stability now allows the tax administrator to take into account the financial situation of tax entities both within the permitting procedure and after the issuance of the permit.
The purpose of this measure is to prevent entities that do not have sufficient financial income to properly fulfill their tax obligations from disposing of selected products.
To assess the economic stability of the petitioner, indicators (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labor productivity) were determined, on the basis of which a financial analysis is performed.
In addition to these indicators, it also depends on the administrative discretion of the tax administrator with regard to the individual conditions of the proceedings.
The law stipulates the periodicity of verification of the fulfillment of the condition of economic stability due to the topicality of data - the verification takes place once a year in connection with the deadline for filing income tax returns.
The tax administrator has the opportunity to set other conditions necessary for the administration of the tax.
If the permit holder does not meet the conditions, the tax administrator is entitled to cancel the permit, or cancel it with a delay.
Of the total number of 2,609 entities for which the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of arrears if the tax liability exceeds the amount of tax security (eg repeated beneficiaries).
The permit was revoked for ten entities, the other applicants increased the tax security, capitalized their contribution to the company or documented current accounting data, according to which they already met all the conditions for issuing the permit.
In addition to the petitioner, the conditions of reliability and indebtedness must also be met by a natural person who is or is a statutory body or a natural person who is neither the petitioner's statutory body nor its member but performs this activity (chaining of legal entities as a statutory body or its member , so - called connected entities).
By the end of 2016, more than 30,000 connected entities had been inspected.
The records kept pursuant to the Act on Excise Duties (Sections 37 to 40 and Section 60 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.) Contain data on:
the type, name, code and quantity of goods produced, taken over, issued or dispatched, broken down by type of disposal procedure (conditional exemption, import, reintroduction, conditional exemption, export, free tax circulation, own consumption, loss);
the identifier (SEED ID) of the consignee or supplier of the selected products, the declarant, the date of occurrence of the event and the entry in the register;
transport of selected products (eg means of transport, carriers, transport numbers);
registration numbers of related documents;
notification of the release for free circulation of alcohol in consumer packaging marked with a control tape and information on its distribution.
A record of acceptance after transport must be made immediately after its completion.
In the case of records kept electronically, the records must be kept or allow output in the format xls, xlsx, par.
Alcohol
After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a set of measures aimed at providing a detailed overview of the activities of entities (see Annex 3, Scheme A) from raw alcohol production through marking with control tape to its distribution to the final seller or authorized user of exempt alcohol.
In the Czech Republic, production facilities for the production of alcohol, which is not in operation, are also subject to customs supervision.
The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview of alcohol processing and production of spirits and to identify persons handling alcohol in consumer packaging, to reduce the handling of alcohol to financially stable and reliable persons and to ensure constant supervision of the production and labeling of spirits.
The most important measures are: Records of production, receipt, stocks and release of alcohol contain information on the amount of alcohol according to the various stages of production and processing of alcohol, with the numbers of documents.
Limitation of the volume of consumer packaging, packaging material and limitation of the number of packages with a broken control tape at the place of final sale or issue to the consumer.
Consumer packaging means a container or other packaging with a volume of max. One liter, resp. three liters in the case of a container made of glass.
Spirits in larger packages are considered unlabelled and prohibited.
At the point of final sale to a natural person for his personal consumption, there may be a maximum of one consumer package with a broken control tape, or three, if they are equipped with a one-way valve.
Mandatory registration of a person who places alcohol in consumer packaging products with at least 15% by volume of alcohol for free circulation and is: an importer of alcohol, a producer of alcohol in the Czech Republic or an operator of a tax warehouse under conditional tax exemption, provided that personal and technical conditions are met .
Personal conditions - reliability, integrity and non-expression of a ban on activity - must be met by the applicant and a person in the position of a statutory body or a responsible representative.
The applicant must provide a deposit of CZK 100,000 to CZK 5,000,000 (ie approx. € 3,700 to € 185,000), depending on the expected amount of control strips collected.
The technical conditions for registration are a suitable place for marking alcohol and equipping the place of marking or the tax warehouse with a camera monitoring device with continuous operation and remote access of the tax administrator.
Registration markings of the control tape are introduced for the marking of spirits with a volume greater than 0.06 liters.
When transporting control tapes, the registration mark of the control tapes must be stated in the transport documents or customs declaration at export.
Until 30 November 2013, the control tape contained a ten-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration sampling number, a code for the application for the allocation of control tapes and a classification code according to the level of ethanol volume concentration.
From 1 December 2013, the control tape now contains two types of identifiers and the amount of alcohol in the consumer package expressed in milliliters of ethanol at 20 ° C, rounded down to the nearest milliliter.
The record of control tapes for marking spirits contains daily records of individual methods of handling control tapes according to registration codes, as well as documents on the basis of which the entry was made.
In the event of destruction, loss or theft of specific control tapes, their holder is obliged to notify the tax administrator electronically of the registration code of the control tapes concerned and their number by the next working day after the decisive fact.
Introduction of a new factual nature of torts and adjustment of the amount of sanctions imposed for breaches of legal regulations in the handling of control tapes.
Sanctions can be imposed up to the amount of excise duty or exceed it up to ten times (eg in case of destruction or loss of control tapes in excess of 0.1% of the total quantity of an individual control tape order, in case of non-return of the control tape within the statutory period).
Restriction of the handling of control tapes only to registered holders, who may not pass them on to another person, except for their provision to a foreign supplier for the purpose of marking spirits in consumer packaging produced outside the Czech Republic.
Exported control tapes must be placed on the consumer package and re-imported no later than nine months after receipt from the tax administrator.
Mandatory registration of an alcohol distributor in consumer packaging, provided that similar personal conditions are met as for the person obliged to mark alcohol and with the obligation to pay a deposit of up to CZK 5,000,000 (ie approx. € 185,000).
Definition of persons for the sale or purchase of alcohol in consumer packaging.
Authorized persons are obliged to sell alcohol in consumer packaging to other registered persons or to final sellers, or they may sell it as a final seller.
They may acquire alcohol from other registered persons, the insolvency administrator, an administrative body, organizational units of the state or unregistered persons during the execution of tax execution.
Notices on the release of alcohol or sale in consumer packaging for free circulation are required to be sent to alcohol administrators and distributors immediately the day after the decisive fact by the tax administrator via the information system maintained by the tax administrator (ORO web client) or in compliance with xml content.
The notification shall include the number of control tapes used, the volume and type of consumer packaging, the percentage by volume of alcohol, the European Commodity Code (EAN), the identification of the distributor or final seller, as well as the product name and production batch.
In 2014 and 2015, tax entities sent approximately 10.5 million notifications.
Mandatory concession (specific form of trade license) not only for the production and processing of alcohol, but also for the sale of alcohol in consumer packaging by an entrepreneur to a natural person for his personal use or another legal or entrepreneurial natural person for his own internal use.
Concessioned trades can be performed only after a decision has been issued by the Trades Licensing Office if the professional competence and other conditions are met.
No prescribed professional competence is required for the sale of alcohol.
The benefit for tax administrators is an overview of sellers and their establishments and restrictions
trading on reliable entities.
In the Czech Republic, in 2014, for the field including the production, processing of fermented alcohol, potable alcohol, spirits and other alcoholic beverages and sales, approx. and in 2015 approx. 104 thous. concessions.
Inspections of compliance with legal regulations in the area of ​​handling excisable products in the Czech Republic are also ensured by the following: trade licensing authorities, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection Authority, the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic, and the Czech Trade Inspection Authority.
If it finds that there has been a breach of duty or a breach of the prohibition, it shall immediately inform the excise duty administrator.
Mineral oils
The Czech Republic has introduced a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex 3, Scheme B), to which mineral oils subject to excise duty are subject, but also selected mineral oils not subject to excise duty, which have been misused for tax evasion.
The system includes supervision from the production of mineral oil through storage, transport, labeling and coloring of selected mineral oils, labeling of some other mineral oils to delivery to the final consumer or user and in some cases the consumption of mineral oils.
The supervision of the customs authorities also includes the production of marking substances for the marking of mineral oils and the handling of these substances.
Mineral oils listed under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (other kerosene), 2710 19 29 (other intermediate oils not mentioned elsewhere) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49 are subject to the marking and coloring of selected mineral oils. if their marking is prohibited.
The labeling of some other mineral oils is subject to, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene and lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion.
It is possible to mark and color selected mineral oils and some other mineral oils with a marking substance only with the permission of the tax administrator.

The most significant new measures since 2012:
Monitoring the handling of special mineral oils, which is a group of mineral oils falling within Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 1999 (ie lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion), the kinematic viscosity at 40 ° C of which is less than 12 mm2. s-1 inclusive and having at least one of the following characteristics: flash point less than 150 ° C, distillation at least 20% by volume, including losses, up to 350 ° C, by distillation.
These mineral oils have been misused as an additive in finished fuels, especially diesel, or have been used or sold directly to power engines because their physical properties are very similar.
Entities handling monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packages exceeding 220 liters must register with the tax administrator.
In order to be registered, the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative must be met, which applies at all times 2 With the exception of beer, fruit wines, other wines and mead and fruit spirits obtained by burning.
3 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.
4 Eg. when using mineral oil as a fuel (except for water voyages, unless they are private recreational craft) or as a component for the production of fuels, if the marking is detrimental to their use.
registration.
As of 30 November 2016, the register of persons handling special mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations; four registrations were canceled at the proposal of the registration holder.
The electronic records must contain detailed information on the receipt, own consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil, including document numbers, notification numbers acquired by the tax authorities, places of storage and consumption, purpose of consumption, place of storage and consumption or, on sale, place of delivery and customer registration number.
Notification of any acquisition of special mineral oil must be made to the tax administrator 24 to 72 hours before receipt.
The identification of trading partners, the name and nomenclature of the special mineral oil, the quantity, the purpose of consumption or information on the sale or transfer shall be reported.
Notification of the estimated quantity of mineral oil acquired, sold or consumed in the relevant year shall be submitted by the entity together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
Notification of the purpose of use and marking, the place of storage or consumption, and the identification of the person to whom the special mineral oil is resold or transferred shall be given before each change.
Notifications are submitted electronically via intelligent forms or a PDF data box.
In 2015, persons handling special mineral oils submitted 630 notifications.
The tax administrator must declare the seizure and confiscation of special mineral oils or a means of transport in cases where he finds out the handling of special mineral oils without registration or when the registered person fails to fulfill his notification obligation.
As in the case of non-compliance with the obligations in respect of the transport of products subject to excise duty, these deficiencies cannot be remedied subsequently.
Registration of a fuel distributor is mandatory for persons who sell or are authorized to sell fuel.
Only persons meeting the following criteria may be registered fuel distributors:
Mandatory concession of the trade license office (specific form of trade license).
The customs office examines the application for a concession, or the appointment of a responsible representative, which examines whether the applicant for the concession, the statutory body or members of the statutory body of the applicant - legal entity and the appointed responsible representative meet the condition of reliability.
If these persons meet the condition of reliability, the customs office issues a favorable opinion.
A reliable person is a person of good character, namely in terms of criminal property, customs and tax law.
The condition for issuing a concession is professional competence.
Indebtedness of the same circle of persons as in the case of reliability.
A debt-free person is a person who provides sufficient guarantees that he will duly and timely fulfill his payment obligations to the state, ie he has no arrears on the state budget and general health insurance.
A fuel distributor may not be prohibited from being judged by a court or administrative authority.
The fuel distributor must not be in liquidation or bankruptcy.
Deposit (or bank guarantee) in the amount of CZK 20,000,000 (ie approx. € 740,000), which can be reduced to CZK 10,000,000 (ie approx. € 370,000) after three years of registration of the fuel distributor and fulfillment of other conditions .
The distributor is obliged to submit the notification of fuel distribution to the customs office within 20 days after the end of the calendar month.
The electronic notification must contain information on the individual purchase and sale of fuels.
The reported data are data on business partners, document numbers, selected product, quantity, price, carrier and transport, place of loading and unloading.
The right to a refund of the tax on mineral oils consumed in primary agricultural production was reintroduced at the end of 2014.
A refund of excise duty on mineral oils can only be claimed for an activity that is clearly related to the activity carried out on land.
In 2015, it was about 64 thousand. of claims for tax refund in the total amount of CZK 1,172,844,680 (ie € 43,401,720).
Since 2017, the government of the Czech Republic has also introduced a refund of excise duty on fuel to farmers with animal production.
Farmers or breeders who, for example, cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats will be able to claim this right.
Tobacco products
Restrictions on the sale of tobacco products at the old tax rate
In response to the long-term failure to achieve budgeted revenues from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced, with effect from 1 December 2014, restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with the old tax rate in the event of a change in the tax rate.
Excise duty on tobacco products is paid using tobacco stickers.
The use of a tobacco label means its placement on a unit package (Section 116 of the Act on Excise Duties).
The production of the tobacco product in the state intended for the final consumer is decisive for the application of the rate of excise duty, and it does not have to be removed from storage, delivery, dispatch or sale, or sale to the final consumer.
The letter of the alphabet characterizing the rate of excise duty is indicated on the tobacco label together with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, the label also indicates the number of pieces in the package, respectively. amount of smoking tobacco in kilograms.
The tobacco label has no identifier.
The length of the transitional period for the resale of unit packets of cigarettes intended for direct consumption and bearing a tobacco label with the previous (old) tax rate was set until the last day of the second calendar month following the entry into force of the new rate of excise duty.
The development of tobacco labeling in 2014 and a comparison with previous years show that tobacco manufacturers have significantly pre-supplied tobacco products with an "old" tax rate each year, effectively shifting the effectiveness of the "new" tax rate by about one year.
Raw tobacco tax
Due to the misuse of raw tobacco for the production of tobacco products without the permission of the tax administrator and non-payment of excise duty, a tax on raw tobacco and monitoring of the handling of raw tobacco were introduced as a measure against tax fraud.
With effect from 1 July 2015, raw tobacco which has not been used or supplied for the manufacture of tobacco products, delivered to another Member State or a third country or for which the origin, purpose of use or person to whom the raw material has been or is intended has been established is subject to excise duty. tobacco delivered.
Restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco
Measures such as supervision of the transport and production of tobacco products, marking of unit packets with control tape and restrictions on sales at defined places have been supplemented by restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.
Production facilities for the processing of tobacco raw materials and the production of tobacco products are not subject to customs supervision.
Raw tobacco may be stored for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products only by a registered person, but such tobacco may not be further processed or processed.
A registered person can only be a person who meets the personal conditions of the applicant, statutory body and responsible representative, which applies throughout the registration.
The conditions of registration are: a) authorization to operate a trade enabling the activity of a person storing raw tobacco, b) reliability, c) indebtedness, d) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco has not been banned from carrying out activities, e) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, f) providing a deposit of CZK 20,000,000 (ie approx. € 740,000).
The electronic records must contain the date of receipt or issue of raw tobacco, the number of the document, the identification of the trading partner, information on the quantity and type of raw tobacco.
Notification of each acquisition of raw tobacco by a registered person storing raw tobacco must be made to the tax authorities 24 to 72 hours before receipt or dispatch.
Data on the trading partner, the quantity of raw tobacco, the storage address, the purpose of use and the details of the carrier shall be reported.
Notification of the estimated quantity of raw tobacco received or dispatched in the relevant year shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
Notifications are submitted electronically via a data box in PDF format.
The transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document with the prescribed particulars.
Excise tax legislation in the Slovak Republic
The legal framework regulating the area of ​​excise duties in the Slovak Republic is based on EU legislation, and thus co-creates its uniform tax system.
Individual types of excise duties are exhaustively determined by the legislation of the Slovak Republic, which is similar to the legislation of neighboring countries.
Definition of legal regulations in the Slovak Republic
Legislative regulation of excise duties is ensured by four laws according to individual tax subjects.
Harmonization was achieved by the adoption of the following acts on excise duties: Act No. 98/2004 Coll., On excise duty on mineral oils, Act No. 106/2004 Coll., On excise duty on tobacco products, Act No. 530 / 2011 Coll., On excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No. 609/2007 Coll., On excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
All laws on excise duties are regulations of substantive law and deal with the taxation of the subject of excise duties in the tax territory.
Act No. 563/2009 Coll., On Tax Administration (Tax Code), is a regulation of procedural law, regulates tax administration, rights and obligations of tax entities and other persons.
This legal framework transposed the individual provisions of Council Directive 2008/118 / EC of 16 December 2008 on the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12 / EEC, and transposed the provisions of other European Community directives and legislation.
Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Slovak Republic
Since 2011, the legislation concerning the administration of excise duties has undergone several fundamental changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.
In the EMCS system, the monitoring of the transport of selected products subject to excise duty under the duty suspension arrangement has been changed from a paper accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system, where these transports are monitored in real time.
Within the EMCS electronic system, the institute of suspending access of tax subjects to the EMCS was introduced in 2015.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
The customs office has the possibility to suspend access precisely when there is a justified fear of overdue or unspecified tax from previous tax periods and its unenforceability.
This concerns the due date of the tax, as the transport of excise goods requires the lodging of a security, which, however, is released upon termination of the transport.
Excise duty on mineral oils
A fundamental change in the administration of the excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the possibility of using so-called red diesel was abolished.
The designated gas oil, commonly also called red diesel, was a mineral oil.
In the past, red diesel was used for specific purposes defined by law, such as agriculture, and its use was favored by a lower rate of excise duty.
This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.
The aim of abolishing red oil was to reduce the public finance deficit, simplify the taxation system for mineral oils and reduce the administrative burden on the businesses involved.
In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely the fuel retailer.
The purpose of this legal change was to introduce the obligation to keep records for all gas stations.
Transparency of the movement of taxed petrol and diesel is linked to the obligation to purchase petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.
In 2014, new institutes of tax entities were introduced, namely the fuel distributor and the fuel consumer.
The change contributed to the elimination of tax evasion for petrol and diesel and clarified the movement of these fuels (see Annex 4, Scheme A).
As part of the fight against tax evasion, the legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils have been extended.
In the Slovak Republic, however, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation to be labeled.
Excise duty on tobacco products
As part of the fight against tax evasion and monitoring of tobacco raw materials, the scope of the Tobacco Raw Materials Act was extended and a new tax entity was introduced - a tobacco raw materials trader.
The tobacco raw material is not a harmonized tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.
Furthermore, the obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products was introduced.
The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks intended for labeling consumer packages of tobacco products.
The control marks are cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.
Under the new system, the purchaser of control marks must apply to the customs office for the issue of control marks electronically, via the information system for the collection of control marks.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax subject and the tax administrator.
One state printing house of control stamps was established - in the Kremnice Mint.
The performance of tax supervision over the printing of control marks was also introduced.
The changes significantly contributed to the elimination of tax evasion.
The new system of printing stamps strengthens the system of inspection of goods, because a unique identification number is generated on the stamp, which can be used to easily verify whether the goods come from legal sources.
Unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd place is the checksum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4th place is a series identifier; 5th-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9th- 12th place is a decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional bar code.
The control mark intended to mark cigarettes must also indicate the price of the cigarettes, the mark for the validity of the rate of excise duty, the number of cigarettes in the consumer package and the length of the cigarettes.
Excise duty on alcoholic beverages
The biggest legislative change affected alcohol, wine and beer, because the original three provisions of substantive law were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.
The Act was drafted mainly due to the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue of taxation of alcoholic beverages, solutions for their production, monitoring of movement, tax security, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, streamline tax administration, reduce administrative burdens for small and medium-sized businesses.
The new way of solving the problem of taxation of individual types of alcoholic beverages introduced the application of a uniform rate of excise duty on alcoholic beverages and took into account the volume percentage of the actual alcohol content.
For sparkling wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the volume percentage of the actual alcoholic strength of the finished product shall be taken into account.
The beer concentration is also expressed as a volume percentage of the actual alcohol content of the finished product.
The category of small producer of fermented beverages has been introduced, the essence of which consists in the exemption from excise duty for an individual who produces sparkling fermented beverage for his own consumption and for the consumption of his household in a maximum quantity of 1,000 liters per marketing year.
The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks intended for labeling consumer packaging of alcohol.
Under the new system, the purchaser of control marks must apply to the customs office for the issue of control marks electronically, via the information system for the collection of control marks.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax subject and the tax administrator.
One state printing house of control stamps was established - in the Kremnice Mint.
The performance of tax supervision over the printing of control marks was also introduced.
The changes significantly contributed to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Scheme B) and the elimination of counterfeiting of control marks.
The new system of printing stamps strengthens the system of inspection of goods, because a unique identification number is generated on the stamp, which can be used to easily verify whether the goods come from legal sources.
Unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd place is the checksum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4th place is a series identifier; 5th-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9th- 12th place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional bar code.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
Excise duties on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one joint act No. 353/2003 Coll.
The tax on solid fuels, the tax on natural gas and some other gases and the tax on electricity are part of Act No. 261/2007 Coll.
In contrast, in the Slovak Republic, each excise duty is regulated by a special law, except for the law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, which includes a tax on alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.
A special law regulates the excise tax on electricity, coal and natural gas.
In the Czech Republic, as of 1 January 2015, the issuance of permits for the handling of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Duty Act is conditional, inter alia, on proving the economic stability of applicants, which the customs authorities verify annually by performing a financial analysis.
In the Slovak Republic, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding on waiving or reducing tax security.
The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic performs tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate over the handling of control marks for marking alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printer and their sale to individual customers.
The law stipulates that the production of control stamps is provided by the state-owned company Mincovna Kremnica.
The production of tobacco labels and control tapes in the Czech Republic is not subject to customs supervision in the printer.
Tobacco stickers and control tapes will be taken over from the printer by the authorized territorial office of the customs office in Kutná Hora.
Tobacco stickers are taken over by their customers at this territorial workplace, and control tapes for marking alcohol are further distributed to the individual locally competent tax administrators according to the place of marking.
The legal regulations of the Czech Republic do not define the manufacturer of tobacco labels and control tapes.
In the Slovak Republic there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products or its part, in the Czech Republic such an obligation is not introduced.
In the Czech Republic, the tobacco label bears the excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when the tobacco labels are collected at the authorized customs office.
In contrast, in the Slovak Republic, the control mark does not include excise duty on tobacco products.
In the Czech Republic, a refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced in the audited period in the case of their use for agricultural crop production, so-called green diesel.
Since 2017, this tax refund has been extended to livestock production.
Such support for farmers has not been introduced in the Slovak Republic (it existed until 31 December 2010 as so-called red diesel).
To strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a deposit of CZK 20 million (ie € 740 thousand) was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic.
As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1,891 entities in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (ie a decrease of 1,717 tax entities).
A similar institute of a fuel distributor has been introduced in the Slovak Republic, but without the deposit required to ensure the excise duty on mineral oils.
In 2014, 303 distributors were registered in the Slovak Republic and in 2015, 407 distributors were registered.
In the Slovak Republic, the institute of a fuel seller and a fuel consumer has been established, to which a permit is issued by the locally competent customs office.
There is no such institute in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils and also some other mineral oils are subject to labeling; in the Slovak Republic, after the abolition of so-called red diesel, the labeling of mineral oils is not applied.
In the Czech Republic, the control tape for marking alcohol contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of alcohol and a twelve-digit registration code with an indication of the spirits of the spirit, according to which the records of control tapes are kept.
The destruction, loss and return of the control tape shall be entered in the register on the following working day.
The tape holder is obliged to notify their use within the same period.
In the Slovak Republic, the control mark intended for marking alcohol in consumer packaging contains a unique twelve-digit identification number, which, if used, is communicated to the tax administrator once a month and serves to verify the authenticity of the control mark.
The records contain the number of collected, used and claimed control marks.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have introduced the institute of compulsory registration, resp. alcohol distributor records.
In the Slovak Republic, the registration is conditioned by the fulfillment of conditions relating, inter alia, to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; an annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol of at least € 100,000 or a paid-up share capital of at least € 100,000; minimum number of 10 employees.
In the Czech Republic, obtaining a registration is conditioned, among other things, by depositing a deposit of CZK 5,000,000 (ie € 185,000) in favor of the tax administrator for the entire period of validity of the registration.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
In the Slovak Republic, the permanent presence of a tax administrator is required for the production of alcohol, not only in consumer packaging.
In the Czech Republic, in the production of alcohol in consumer packaging, a special form of registration of a person obliged to mark alcohol is required, subject to a deposit in favor of the tax administrator in the amount of CZK 100,000 (ie € 3,700) up to CZK 5,000,000 (ie € 185,000). ) according to the number of control tapes removed and the installation of a monitoring device with continuous access by the tax administrator.
Evaluation
The legislation of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic far exceeds the minimum EU requirements for the subject and administration of excise duties and responds to the identified risks from other Member States as well as to the risks identified in the tax territories.
Legislative changes adopted during the audited period allow tax administrations to prevent possible tax evasion to a greater extent.
In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, as part of the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw materials (eg leaves), an excise tax on raw tobacco was introduced in addition to EU legislation, resp. tobacco raw materials.
Although raw tobacco and tobacco raw material are not a harmonized tobacco product, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic monitor their movement.
The SAO CR and the SAO SR may recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.
In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that the examination of economic stability of applicants for permits under the Excise Tax Act has proved its worth, as it reduces the risks of tax arrears.
For this reason, both control institutions recommend applying such inspections also in the conditions of the Slovak Republic.
The distribution of control stamps in the Slovak Republic is more efficient than in the Czech Republic, because it does not burden the customs authorities with costs related to transport between the printer and the customer of control tapes and tobacco labels.
The Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic has a better overview of the existence and location of technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is more efficient to collect the tax on tobacco products, because the order of the tobacco label itself is a tax return with subsequent payment of the tax.
Thanks to the introduction of the "fuel seller" and "fuel consumer" institutes, the Financial Administration in the Slovak Republic has a better overview of fuel sales points.
The introduction of mandatory labeling of mineral oils in the Czech Republic enables easier control of the misuse of mineral oils with a reduced tax rate, resp. exempt from tax.
In the Czech Republic (2013) and in the Slovak Republic (2014), a new control tape was introduced, resp. stamp containing the identification code.
The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in the Slovak Republic the new legislation has waived its introduction.
Impacts cannot yet be assessed due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.
Introduction of effective labeling of consumer packaging of alcohol with a control mark, resp. tape is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.
The SAO SR and the SAO CR may recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States as well.
The position of the Slovak Republic on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterized by a pro-client approach, which does not block the financial resources of tax subjects.
On the other hand, the Czech Republic's approach is rather restrictive, as it introduces a deposit burdening the cash flow of tax subjects, but further reduces the risk of tax arrears.
Development of revenues from excise duties
Excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the state in order to increase state budget revenues and also to regulate the amount of goods sold, the consumption of which is considered harmful to individuals and / or society (regulatory function of the tax).
According to the Commission Communication: EUROPE 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3 March 2010 under the Less Resource-Intensive Europe flagship initiative, the European Commission intends to improve the framework for the use of market-based instruments, including through a tax review. energy with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.
In order to fulfill the EC's intention, Member States should strive to shift the tax burden from the labor force to, among other things, energy and environmental taxation, in the context of greater "greening" of tax systems.
Collection of excise taxes on excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic includes collection of excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.
The share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share in GDP is monitored, among others, by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Both SAIs used the following selection criteria to query the OECD website.
Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share in GDP decreased slightly according to OECD data.
The exchange rate of the European Central Bank of the ECB was used to convert amounts in CZK to € as at 31 December of the respective year.
The nominal exchange rate of CZK against € in 2013 weakened by 9.1% year-on-year compared to 2012 (from 25,140 to 27,425).
The main reason was the monetary policy decision of the CNB Board of Governors on 7 November 20136.
The resulting values ​​of collection of excise duties, excise duty rates and per capita income in € decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.
The significant decrease in the share of excise duties in 2014 was caused by a one-off shortfall in excise duty revenues from tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of tobacco products with the old tax rate.
The share of excise duties is also affected by the growth in the collection of income taxes, which has increased significantly as a result of the improved overall economic situation in the Czech Republic.
The excise tax on mineral oils has the largest share in the total collection of excise duties (approximately 55.7% in 2015), but this fell despite the significant growth of the economy compared to 2012.
The collection of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although in 2013 the registration of fuel distributors was introduced as a measure against tax fraud.
The trend in environmentally efficient vehicles and the promotion of biofuels have a negative effect on tax revenue.
The tax on natural gas, the tax on solid fuels and the tax on electricity have a negligible share, which is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU, compared to neighboring countries.
Unless rates are increased, their share will decline in the future due to the ever-decreasing energy intensity of buildings and production processes.
The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the repercussions of a large-scale case of tax fraud consisting in the marketing of untaxed alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or insufficiently denatured alcohol in the form of spirits.
In 2015, following the adoption of a number of measures against such conduct and the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the collection from 2012 by € 4 million.
The share of the tobacco tax has increased as a result of rising rates.
The basic rates of excise duties changed between 2012 and 2015 for the tax on tobacco products, where the rate was increased mainly due to compliance with Council Directive 2011/64 / EU on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.
Due to the CNB's monetary intervention, the real rate of excise duties in €, excluding the tax on tobacco products, fell significantly. For tobacco products, it increased only slightly.
In relation to price growth, GDP or living standards, the indexation of the rate of excise duties is not set, so the functions of excise duties consisting in the regulation of socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.
With the economic growth of the Czech Republic and the growth of living standards, real excise tax rates are decreasing.
7 Indexation - automatic adjustment of a certain economic variable to inflation, this adjustment takes place on the basis of a law or a contract (for pensions paid by the state, it is called valorisation).
Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Slovak Republic
The current legislative regulation of excise duties in the Slovak Republic does not address the indexation of the level of excise duties on the development of consumer prices, because they are fixed.

Of all the excise taxes introduced in Slovakia, the largest share in the annual tax revenues of the state budget is the excise tax on mineral oils, while its share did not fall below 52% in the entire audited period.
The second largest share is reported by the excise duty on tobacco products.
On average, this tax accounts for approximately 32% of the total excise duty collection.
Between 2012 and 2015, there was an increase in the collection of excise duty per capita in the Slovak Republic.
This development is due to the growth of excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
The growth in the collection of excise duties per capita in the Slovak Republic is constant and corresponds to the development of excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
In the Czech Republic, the decline in per capita income is influenced by the CNB's intervention in the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro.
The difference between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which in the Czech Republic is about 2.7 times, resp. 2.8 times higher, but per capita in the Czech Republic, the collection for these selected products is only about 1/3 higher.
The reason is the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the exchange rate of CZK against € for foreign consumers.
The tax on mineral oils is also due to greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.
In the case of the tax on tobacco products, the growing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border shopping have a significant impact.
Evaluation Real excise duty rates in the Czech Republic declined as a result of CNB interventions.
The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in total tax revenues is not rising and there is no shift from labor taxation to consumption taxation of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.
However, the achieved values ​​of the share of excise duties are consistently above the OECD average.
The overall collection of excise duties is mainly affected by changes in excise duty rates, the development of the economic condition and the behavior of the population.
Future shortfalls in the collection of excise duties due to environmental measures, which the state subsidizes in various forms, will have to be replaced by other revenues or reductions in state expenditures.
The non-introduction of indexation of excise duty rates in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic reduces their regulatory functions and insufficiently supports the EU's goals of a Europe less dependent on environmentally unsustainable resources and on reducing its dependence on alcohol and tobacco.
The higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic reflects the higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is affected by the lower total price of selected products in €.
Administrative expenditure of excise duties
The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the relationship between expenditures and revenues related to the administration of excise duties, ie it expresses the amount of expenditures per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).
The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of administrative costs.
The effectiveness of the tax administrator in tax administration affects the scope and organizational structure of the tax administrator, the management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of electronic activities.
The determination of the efficiency of administrative costs of tax administration by the method of conversion coefficient is based on the number of employees participating in the administration of excise duties in a line-managed structure.
In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is performed, among other activities, by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is an independent organizational unit of the state and an accounting unit.
In the Slovak Republic, the tax administration is provided by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, while the customs administration bodies are an internal organizational unit, costs and revenues are included in aggregate for the entire organizational unit.
Therefore, with regard to the possibility of comparing the efficiency of the administration of excise duties, the expenditures and revenues of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were also included in the calculation of the efficiency of administrative costs.
Administrative costs of excise tax administration in the Czech Republic
The administration of excise duties is a complex of administrative acts performed mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
Some partial inspections are performed by other public administration bodies, but their importance is negligible.
The administration of excise duties is performed mainly by the following departments:
General Directorate of Customs

Administrative costs of excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic
Since 1 January 2012, the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic has undergone a demanding transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS program.
The establishment of the FR SR was also reflected in the composition of employees of the newly established departments of the merged customs and tax administration.
In connection with the performance of excise tax administration, activities related to excise tax administration within the organizational structure of the FR SR were integrated into a larger number of different sections and related departments.
Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic Customs and Tax Section of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic Department of Excise Duties (all-Slovak competence):
excise duty department - directs and coordinates activities in the field of excise tax administration; prepares expert opinions; submits proposals and comments on legislative changes; issues decisions on the delegation of local jurisdiction to taxable persons; assigns and cancels registration subscription numbers;
Tax Supervision Department - directs and coordinates activities in the area of ​​tax supervision and tax control; performs tax supervision;
ELO and SPD systems department - directs and coordinates the activities of mutual administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties, including the exchange of information through the SEED and MVS systems; provides management and updates in SysNeD and EMCS application equipment;
Control Stamps Department - directs activities in the field of printing and handling of control stamps; performs tax supervision over the loading and disposal of printing sheets and control stamps in the printer.
Department of the Vice President of Financial Administration
Department of Remedies for Excise Duties and Customs (nationwide competence):
Excise Tax Appeals Department - reviews the decisions of customs offices on the basis of ordinary and extraordinary remedies applied; appeal proceedings at the second stage of the decision-making process.
The Customs Offices section was established during 2012; it directly involved the individual customs offices (9 customs offices), which have a territorial jurisdiction determined by the higher territorial units, with the exception of one customs office, which was set up, inter alia, to carry out tasks related to the Community's external border.
Customs offices:
excise duties department - performance of methodological activities in relation to branches of customs offices and stations of customs offices; for selected entities, the tax administrator performs direct actions, and this decides on registration (tax warehouse, authorized recipient, repeated, registered consignor), the amount of tax security, determines and refunds the tax, performs tax supervision and tax control; decides on the waiver of the tax security; decides to waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee in a tax warehouse for alcohol;
legal department - decision-making activity in the matter of tax violations; activities related to ordinary and extraordinary remedies; tax enforcement proceedings;
branch of the customs office - decides on registration (with the exception of the tax warehouse, the authorized recipient for repeated receipt, the registered consignor), the amount of tax security; prescribes and refunds the tax; performs tax supervision and tax control; decides on security and confiscation of goods;
customs office - performance of tax supervision over the holding and movement of goods subject to excise duty; ensures the performance of permanent tax supervision in the tax warehouse for alcohol; decides on security and confiscation of goods.
Expenditures of the Slovak financial administration on the administration of excise duties are constantly growing, as, with the exception of wage growth, investments in effective tax administration and electronic financial administration are increasing.
Although excise revenue was growing, spending was growing faster due to IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project.
Wage expenditures in the Slovak Republic are significantly affected by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol, which is not applied by the Czech Republic.
Expenditures of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on the administration of excise duties between 2012 and 2015 increased more significantly in 2015, this growth was mainly due to an increase in wage expenditures and expenditures on technical support.
In the Czech Republic, revenues from excise duties also grew at approximately the same rate.
Compared to the Slovak Republic, wage expenditures in the Czech Republic are positively affected by the broader competencies of the customs administration, such as weighing trucks, monitoring the fulfillment of obligations in connection with tolls.
The efficiency of administrative costs in the Slovak Republic shows a slightly deteriorating trend year-on-year.
The number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditures per employee increased.
Also in the Czech Republic, the number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditures per employee grew more slowly than in the Slovak Republic.
Evaluation
In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, wage growth is a significant factor in the worsened efficiency of administrative expenditures, which can be assessed as a natural development.
In both countries, maintaining a significant administrative burden in the administration of excise duties appears to be a negative factor, which is confirmed by the non-decreasing number of employees in the area of ​​excise administration.
In the Slovak Republic, however, the administration of excise duties at lower incomes is significantly more demanding on staff capacity.
Performance indicators of excise administration
The administration of excise duties is a set of activities aimed at the correct detection, determination and security of tax payment.
The main processes in the administration of excise duties are tax assessment, permitting and registration for activities, transport supervision, control and search for tax subjects.
The number of administrative acts and managed entities are indicators of the performance of the tax administrator.
The mutual relationship between the monitored indicator and the number of tax administrators expresses the efficiency of the tax administrator's activities and defines the cost of a specific activity.
Authorization and registration for the activity are a basic precondition for the handling of selected products for commercial purposes and their transport in the regime of conditional exemption from tax.
The tax administrator is obliged to perform a systematic administration of entities with a permit or registration with a focus on supervising compliance with legal regulations and conditions set by the tax administrator, to which adequate human resources must be allocated.
The monitored indicator was the number of valid permits or registrations to operate as of 31 December of each year.
The number of issued permits or registrations is not the same as the number of tax subjects.
Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in a matter.
The monitored administrative acts are the frequency of the most significant acts of the tax administrator (tax assertion, transport administration in EMCS), or activities that are a sequence of acts ending in a report or decision.
Performance indicators in the Czech Republic
Permission and registration for activities in the Czech Republic
Tax warehouse:
Selected products can be produced, processed, stored, received or sent with the permission of the tax administrator to operate a tax warehouse.
If the operator of a tax warehouse has more warehouses, a permit is issued for each one separately, including securing the tax.
Securing the tax is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administrator (ie the physical presence of an official and securing the equipment by the conclusions of the tax administrator).
Permanent tax supervision does not apply in the Czech Republic.
The operator of a tax warehouse also registers for tax pursuant to Section 125 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.
Authorization to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for transport of selected products conditionally exempt from tax from the place of import to the tax warehouse, to the authorized consignee in another Member State, to the place of export in another Member State or to the consignee in another Member State. Article 4 (10) of Council Directive 2008/118 / EC).
Tax warehouse statistics do not include permits to acquire electricity, natural gas and solid fuels without tax, which are analogous to tax warehouse permits.
The growing distillery produces alcohol with a reduced 50% tax rate (CZK 14,300 / hl of ethanol) - fruit distillates for growers. It is not a tax warehouse and the operating permit is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.
The reduced tax rate can be applied to 30 liters of pure alcohol per household of a grower intended for personal consumption for the production period (July-June).
The records of the growing distillery kept by the distillery operators and made available to the tax authorities must contain information on the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.
The authorized consignee for re-acceptance of selected products and the authorized consignee for one-time acceptance of selected products are entitled to receive or re-accept selected products in a conditional system transported from another Member State on a one-off basis with the permission of the tax administrator and specified conditions.
The eligible consignee is not the operator of the tax warehouse and may not store or dispatch the selected products under the conditional tax exemption regime.
The user of selected tax-exempt products is a legal or natural person who receives and uses, or pursuant to Section 52a or Section 53 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll. sells to another user selected exempt products; users have the status of taxable persons without the obligation to register for tax.
Selected exempt products can only be received and used on the basis of a valid permit, and only from the supplier specified in the permit.
Under the permit, exempt mineral oils can be sold to another holder of a use permit or a user who is authorized to use mineral oils without a permit.
Tax-exempt mineral oils can be sold without a permit in statutory cases, such as:
waste oils in quantities of less than 10 000 liters per calendar year, if they have been produced by the user or have been generated by the user,
selected exempt mineral oils in unit packages of a capacity not exceeding 20 liters, intended for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat production and intended for sale to the final consumer.
Selected exempt products can be transported with proof of exemption.
The distributor of alcohol in consumer packaging is entitled to sell or otherwise transfer alcohol released for free tax circulation after mandatory registration with the tax administrator.
Based on the registration with the tax administrator and the set conditions, the storer of raw tobacco is entitled to store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the production of tobacco products.
A person handling special mineral oils is entitled to acquire, sell or otherwise transfer special mineral oils that are in bulk or placed in packages exceeding 220 liters on the basis of registration with the tax administrator and the specified conditions.
Based on the issued concession and registration of the tax administrator, the fuel distributor is entitled to sell fuel on the territory of the Czech Republic under specified conditions, with the exception of the sale of fuel from a service station.
The transport of fuel must be accompanied by a tax document, a sales document or a transport document, or a delivery plan and filling tickets.
These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent to the tax authorities before the start of the transport.
The service station operator is the owner of the fuel sold at the service station.
Petrol stations are places where, with the permission of the building authority, the sale or dispensing of fuel is usually permitted in the fuel tank.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade registers filling stations and their operators, broken down into: registered - regular sale or dispensing of fuel, usually in the fuel tanks of vehicles; with limited access - operation usually in various business premises (eg quarries, sawmills, agricultural farms, transport organizations, construction yards), the sale is carried out here for the other party to a limited extent on the basis of specific contractual relationships; non-public - fuel dispensing points only for operators' own consumption.
A service station is not a structure or device in the form of a service tank located in operation (eg on a chassis) if the fuel is dispensed only for its own use.
Operating tanks are not subject to the permission of the tax administrator and are not registered.
Natural and legal persons may buy, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases released for free circulation for resale with the permission of the tax administrator.

Performance indicators in Slovakia
Permission and registration for activities in the Slovak Republic
The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is provided primarily by the customs authorities and the Department of Excise Duties of the Customs and Tax Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic, whose procedure in the administration of excise duties is regulated by individual excise duty laws and the Tax Code.
These laws stipulate not only the scope of authorization for the CA and the FR of the Slovak Republic in the administration of excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax subjects in connection with the registration or payment of excise duty.
The largest year-on-year increase in tax subjects (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, which was caused by an increase in permits issued within tax warehouses, an increase in registrations of eligible beneficiaries for re-admission and registration of a large number of user enterprises.
The legislation specified the transport of certain bulk mineral oils, as well as the notification obligation if they are transported in bulk, resp. in packages with a capacity of more than 150 liters, resp. 230 liters, and also extended the list of mineral oils subject to inspection and transport to other goods, such as anti-knock products, oxidation inhibitors, resin inhibitors, viscosity improvers, anti-corrosion products.
Mandatory information has been introduced for lubricating oils regarding the indication of their kinematic viscosity.
An approximation of the registration process for selected tax entities in the sense of national legislation in the Slovak Republic is given in the following sections of the document.
Tax warehouse operator
Within the framework of the national legislation of the Slovak Republic, when registering the operator of a tax warehouse within all subjects of excise duties, a person who wants to operate a tax warehouse must also apply for registration and issue a permit for the operation of a tax warehouse.
The final decision in the registration process is a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, by which the operator of the tax warehouse acquires legal personality for all tax warehouses.
At the same time, the CA issues a permit for the operation of a tax warehouse, which entitles the operator of the tax warehouse in the said tax warehouse to produce, process, store, receive or send selected products under the conditional tax exemption regime.
If the operator of the tax warehouse has tax warehouses in several places, the tax administrator will issue a separate permit for the operation of the tax warehouse for each tax warehouse.
The transport of the subject of excise duty in the conditional tax exemption regime is monitored electronically via the EMCS system.
A unique reference code is generated for each shipment, the so-called
ARC code under which the shipment can be tracked online and therefore in real time.
If the operator of the tax warehouse is also a person authorized to distribute alcohol, he is obliged to notify the CA electronically of the trade name of the alcohol packaging, the volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the alcohol packaging and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging he puts into free tax circulation, at the latest on the day of its introduction.
Registered sender
A registered consignor is a special type of taxable person who cannot be registered as a tax warehouse operator at the same time, even if he sends the subject of excise duty under a duty suspension arrangement after its release for free circulation.
Within the national legislation of the Slovak Republic when registering a registered consignor within all excise duty items, a person who wants to send the excise duty item in the conditional tax exemption regime after its release into the customs regime "free circulation" must also apply to the CA for registration and issuance of permits send the subject of excise duty in this mode.
The customs office will issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty and at the same time will also issue a permit to send the subject of excise duty in the regime of conditional exemption from tax after its release into the customs regime "free circulation".
Growing distillery
The basic act for the operation of a growing distillery is to obtain a permit for the production of alcohol in a distillery plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.
However, the permit from the Ministry does not entitle the holder of the permit to operate a growing distillery.
In order to be able to operate a growing distillery, a person must submit an application for registration and issue a certificate of registration of the growing distillery operator to the CA.
The customs office will issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, which also authorizes the operator of the growing distillery to produce alcohol in the growing distillery.
The purpose of the distillery is to provide services to growers.
A growing distillery cannot be a tax warehouse.
The legislature allows alcohol produced in the growing distillery to apply a reduced tax rate of 50% of the basic tax rate, ie € 540 / hl and.
The reduced rate of tax shall apply to alcohol produced in a growing distillery in a quantity not exceeding 43 l a. Per grower and his household for one production period in the tax territory.
The production period lasts from 1 July of the current year to 30 June of the following year.
The production period is not the same as the calendar year, and therefore it is possible to apply a reduced tax rate to the alcohol produced several times within one calendar year, because the alcohol is produced in two production periods.
This is the production of alcohol outside the conditional tax exemption regime, which in practice means that the alcohol produced is in free tax circulation.
The grower pays not only the excise duty and value added tax to the grower's distillery, but also the price for the services provided.
The growing distillery issues a removal certificate to the grower, which serves not only as proof of proof of origin and method of acquisition of alcohol, but also of payment of excise duty.
The transport of alcohol produced in this way is not subject to monitoring by the tax administrator.
Importer of consumer packaging
National legislation allows persons who intend to import consumer packaging of alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third country in the course of their business and to release it for free circulation in the tax territory to apply to the CA for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.
The importer of consumer packaging does not register for the relevant excise duty, but the CA issues a certificate of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.
That certificate authorizes the importer to import consumer packaging of alcohol or consumer packaging of cigarettes from the territory of a third country.
At the same time, before issuing control marks, he must lodge a tax guarantee in the amount of the tax relating to the quantity of alcohol or cigarettes which he wishes to release for free circulation.
The importer of consumer packaging must release for free tax only consumer packaging marked with a control mark.
To that end, they must present to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the control marks exported to the territory of the third country.
Upon import, the importer is obliged to have the number of control marks re-imported from the territory of a third country confirmed by the customs office of importation.
When importing consumer packaging, the importer proceeds in the sense of customs regulations, where the amount of excise duty is also part of the customs debt.
In the case of release for free circulation of consumer packaging, the tax security lodged shall be returned to the importer or may be used to pay the customs debt.
The importer of consumer packaging is not a tax warehouse.
If the importer of a consumer package of alcohol is also a person authorized to distribute alcohol, he is obliged to notify the CA electronically of the trade name of the alcohol package, the volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the alcohol package and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer package he puts into free tax circulation. , at the latest on the day of its launch.

For each establishment, the permit holder is obliged to keep records for the number of received consumer packaging of alcohol, number of issued consumer packaging of alcohol, stock of alcohol in consumer packaging of alcohol as of the last day of the month and records of shortage or surplus in received and issued consumer packaging of alcohol. .
The holder of the authorization is obliged to purchase alcohol or otherwise take it in the course of business activity only from a person authorized for distribution.

The holder of the distribution authorization is obliged to purchase alcohol in consumer packaging only from another person authorized for distribution.
The person authorized for distribution notifies the data for each calendar month electronically, by the 25th day of the following calendar month.
Fuel seller
In order to monitor fuels in free tax circulation, as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced, namely the fuel retailer.
There is no special regulation governing filling stations in the Slovak Republic.
Therefore, filling stations are incorporated in the national legislation of the Slovak Republic as sellers of fuels.
A person who wants to sell petrol, diesel or LPG for final consumption in free tax circulation as part of a business activity in the tax territory is obliged to apply to the CA for a sales permit and submit a document proving that the storage facility is verified and equipped with a suitable a certified measuring device enabling the quantity of mineral oil to be measured on receipt and dispensing, and the tank must comply with technical standards.

To prove the method of acquiring fuel, for example, an invoice is sufficient, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor assigned by the tax administrator.
The tax administrator in the territory of the Slovak Republic records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods when performing tax supervision over mineral oils.
Above all, it is an effort to avoid roadside checks during transport, which is why hauliers use secondary roads, bypassing the toll collection system due to the difficulty of monitoring actual transports.
Transport of mineral oils in rebuilt double-bottomed tanks is also carried out.
It often happens that illegal transports are accompanied by a vehicle, which the carriers report possible mobile patrols in order to change the route and avoid roadside checks.
There is also a mixing of fuels with light fuel oils, respectively. waste oils.
Fuel distributor
In order to monitor fuels in free tax circulation, as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced, namely the fuel distributor.

That document shall contain, in addition to information on quantities, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the traffic inspectorate.
As these are fuels in free tax circulation, no accompanying document is required for the transport of these goods.
To prove the method of acquiring fuels, for example, an invoice is sufficient, which also contains the number of the distributor of fuels, resp. registered persons assigned by the tax administrator.
Fuel consumer
The fuel consumer has a special position in national legislation.
A person who purchases petrol, diesel or LPG for his own consumption in the tax territory for free consumption and stores this mineral oil in a storage facility with a capacity of 15,000 liters or more must notify the customs office of this fact at the latest before the first placing in the storage area. device.

The tank must meet technical standards.
The fuel consumer must purchase fuel only from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.

Administrative tasks in the Slovak Republic
This subchapter describes the performance of tax supervision of excise tax administration for selected tax entities in the sense of national legislation in the Slovak Republic.
The largest year-on-year increase in administrative operations (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, which was caused by the number of transport operations in the EMCS system.
On the other hand, the largest year-on-year decline was recorded in 2014, by as much as 4.3%, which was due to a smaller number of completed tax audits and a smaller number of filed tax returns.
This decrease concerned legislative changes.
Tax inspections
By performing a tax audit, the CA ascertains or verifies the facts decisive for the correct determination of the tax.
When performing tax audits, CA employees prove themselves by an authorization to perform tax audits, which contains, among other things, the purpose and subject of the audit and the scope of audited tax periods.
In practice, this means that the controlled tax period can be one month, but also more tax periods.
The scope of audited tax periods is determined by the CA.
The tax audit begins with the writing of a record of the commencement of the tax audit.
The CA will confirm the receipt of the documents.
The CA is obliged to return the borrowed documents within 30 days of the end of the tax audit.
The CA employee prepares a report from the tax audit.
If the tax audit finds a difference in the sum that the audited tax entity was to pay, report or for which it claimed a tax refund, the CA shall send the audited tax entity, together with the report, also an invitation to comment on the findings stated in the protocol.
The tax audit is completed on the day of delivery of the protocol.
The deadline for carrying out a tax audit is a maximum of one year from the date of its commencement.
Tax control of registered persons and selected registered persons will be performed as required, but at least once until the date of termination of the right to determine the tax, which is 5 years.
The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic issued an internal governing act, which adjusted the above-mentioned deadlines due to the uniform procedure of the tax administrator in the territory of the Slovak Republic.
The local investigation
A local investigation is the activity of the tax administrator, in the framework of which it searches for evidence, examines and ascertains facts that are necessary for the purposes of tax administration.
The CA employee writes a record of the local investigation and submits a copy to the tax subject.
When carrying out a local investigation, a CA employee has the right to unrestricted access to land, operating buildings, rooms and places, including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.
The settlement of the quantity of alcohol produced is ascertained in the form of a local survey.
The ascertained facts are the basis for the performance of tax control.
Also during the local investigation, the CA is entitled to take samples as well as to secure the case.
The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic issued an internal governing act, which regulated the performance of tax supervision and local investigation for individual items of excise duties due to the unification of the tax administrator's procedures.
Permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol
With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1 May 2004, there was also a change in the area of ​​excise tax administration.
The need for more efficient spending of state budget funds in the administration of excise duty on alcohol, improvement of the business environment in the area and the introduction of legislative instruments for more effective suppression of the gray economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in connection with excise tax administration.
One of the measures brought about by the new legislative change was not only the transfer of the tax administrator in the area of ​​excise tax administration from tax offices to customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for the tax administrator to be present in the tax warehouse for alcohol.
In the territory of the Slovak Republic, national legislation exhaustively defines that it is only possible to receive, dispense, produce or process alcohol in a tax warehouse in the presence of a CA employee.
This does not apply to a tax warehouse that receives, stores or sends alcohol only in consumer packaging of alcohol.
At the same time, the CA arises the obligation to secure employees in the tax warehouse so that the receipt, issue, production or processing of alcohol is not restricted.
The tax warehouse operator is obliged to ensure the working environment for CA employees.
Based on the contract concluded with the FR of the Slovak Republic for the provided premises, the CA pays the rental costs to the operator of the tax warehouse on a monthly basis.
In a tax warehouse during the production, processing or storage of alcohol, the alcohol storage plant must be adapted in such a way that the quantities of alcohol produced, processed alcohol, stored alcohol, including stocks of alcohol and alcohol contained therein, can be determined at any time.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
If the alcohol is not received, issued, produced or processed in the tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to ensure the presence of an employee of the customs office, while it is obliged to secure this space with the closure of the customs office.
In practice, however, this option is not used very often, as tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs employee to their advantage.
Some tax warehouse operators use the legal option within the meaning of Act No. 467/2002 Coll., On the production and marketing of alcohol, and use production facilities for the production of alcohol in a distillery for growing distillery and also for the purposes of a distillery, which must be a tax warehouse.
The performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol is ensured by approximately 250 customs officers.

The seller of consumer packaging of alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep records of, among other things, the purchase and sale.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not issue any permit for final sellers of consumer packaging of alcohol, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of alcohol by the Trade Licensing Office; the final seller does not keep any special records.
In the Slovak Republic, the seller of fuels must have a permit from the tax administrator to sell them.
National legislation in the Slovak Republic does not regulate filling stations by any special regulation; all activities related to filling stations are regulated only in the Act on Excise Duty on Mineral Oils.
In the Czech Republic, petrol stations are regulated by a special law on fuels, but the tax administrator does not issue any permits for the sale of fuels.
Gas stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
In the Slovak Republic, it is not technically possible to obtain a list of filling stations from the financial management system.
In the Slovak Republic, there has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.
This increase was due to a legislative change in that period.
In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits in 2013 decreased significantly due to the introduction of a deposit for fuel distributors.
Administrative tasks
In the Slovak Republic, substantive legal regulations stipulate the obligation to perform tax audits of selected tax entities.
This issue is specified in more detail by an internal governing act issued by the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic due to the application of a uniform procedure of tax administrators in the territory of the Slovak Republic.
In the Czech Republic, substantive legal regulations do not regulate the obligation to perform tax audits; procedural law regulations only stipulate the possibility of carrying out audits by the deadline for tax assessment at the latest.
The reason for large differences in the number of performed tax inspections and local investigations in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is the fact that the internal governing act of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic stipulates in which cases and within which deadlines or its return verified in particular by a local investigation.
The number of comparable administrative acts in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 due to an increase in the number of transports in the EMCS system and at the same time due to an increase in the number of filed tax returns.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of administrative operations between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly increasing tendency, which was influenced by the increasing number of transports in the EMCS system and at the same time by the decrease in the number of tax returns.
Evaluation
The large differences between the number of comparable permits and the registration of tax subjects were affected by different legislation.
The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the individual years of the audited period.
In the Slovak Republic, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds compared to the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for approximately the same number of administrative acts.
From the above, it can be stated that the Slovak Republic is more focused on the performance of administrative tasks by the tax administrator, such as the performance of physical tax supervision.
In the Czech Republic, more emphasis is placed on remote monitoring, such as monitoring devices, direct data transmission via a web interface and risk analysis.
Electronic administrative tasks
Electronic administrative tasks in the Czech Republic
The tax return can be filed via the data box.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced so-called interactive forms of tax returns, which, however, can no longer be processed automatically.
The data must be further transferred to the personal tax account of the tax subject.
The benefit is the reduction of the error rate of filed tax returns (DAP), which saves the actions of the tax administrator related to the procedure for corrections of incorrectly filed DAP.
The GDC is working on a new application for electronic DAP processing.
Through smart forms, it is also possible to: file tax applications or registrations and notify changes of data, claim a refund, comply with notification obligations for the handling of special mineral oils, the handling of raw tobacco and the fulfillment of biofuel obligations.
The handling of control tapes is recorded by tax subjects in the ORO WebKlient information system, which is available for registered subjects for registration of data specified by the tax administrator.
The transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under the conditional tax exemption regime must be carried out in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality in the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).
The transport of selected products in free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be carried out with a document proving their taxation, proof of exemption from excise duty, customs decision to release selected products into customs, simplified accompanying document or other decision on excise duty.
The required content of the data is determined by legal regulations.
To facilitate the fulfillment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (§ 5 and § 6 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.).
It allows the paper form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents, which are sent via the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic to a data warehouse, where each such document is assigned a unique twelve-digit identification code (JIK).
The JIK serves the purpose of control by the customs authorities on the road and prevents repeated transport on the same document.
At the largest operator of a fuel tax warehouse in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of fuel into free tax circulation, CS ČR has online access to an electronic registration system in which the entity automatically stores issued tax documents.
CS CR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, ie an electronic system for recording and monitoring the transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.
This system should use 70% of the existing EMCS functional specification.
The advantage will be a user-friendly environment for declarants and customs officers.
It will also be connected to the system of global guarantees, to the register of tax subjects or to the system of risk analysis.
The system should provide an overview of free circulation traffic between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of written documents without registration and sharing of reference numbers through simplified accompanying documents.
The risks of the current procedure of registration of transports of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen primarily in the misuse of the simplified accompanying document, repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.
Electronization of administrative tasks in the Slovak Republic
When administering excise duties, the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic uses electronic communication when monitoring the movement of goods in the EMCS system in the regime of conditional tax exemption, control stamps, filing tax returns and also when registering and registering tax subjects.
In 2014, one-way electronic communication between tax entities and the tax administrator was also introduced, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.
As part of electronic communication, after entering access data, the tax subject has access to a personal internet zone, the so-called electronic personal mailbox, which is intended for communication with the financial administration.
Within this zone, the taxable person has access to an electronic filing system, through which he submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents related to the administration of excise duties.
However, electronic communication via the personal internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.
National legislation defines tax entities that are required to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.
These are mainly payers of value added tax, tax advisors representing the tax entity and lawyers representing the tax entity.
During the audit, the SAO SR also dealt with the issue of the extent of the electronic administration of excise duties.
These were only fully electronic transactions, namely tax returns and electronic communication within ELO.
Apart from the transport carried out in the EMCS system, there has been an increase in the computerization of selected comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
In the Slovak Republic, fully electronic processing of the tax return has already been introduced, from its submission to the registration of the tax liability.
In the Czech Republic, electronic processing of tax returns is not set.
In the Czech Republic, it is possible for tax subjects to insert mandatory documents for individual transports in free tax circulation on the website.
In the future, the reporting of transport in free tax circulation in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system is being prepared.
Evaluation
The system of reporting transports in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax supervision, thus eliminating the transport of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid in violation of legislation.
This can be recommended as a good practice.

Due to good practice in the Slovak Republic in the field of electronic tax returns, the SAO SR and the SAO CR recommend to complete the electronic processing of tax returns in the Czech Republic.
Analysis of changes in organizational structure and personnel in the field of excise duties
The organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic has undergone fundamental changes.
Organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic
Since 1 January 2013, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic consists of the General Directorate of Customs and customs offices, which are administrative offices and organizational units of the state.
The GDC is the accounting unit for the whole customs administration.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been performing the comprehensive administration of excise duties since 2004 as one of the many competencies it provides.
CS CR also performs:
(a) control:
ശശ in the field of road transport (weighing of lorries, payment of tolls for the use of roads, fulfillment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road freight transport and in matters of international passenger transport),
ശശ waste and packaging material management,
ശശ safety of imported food,
ശശ in the field of consumer protection and protection of intellectual property rights,
ശശ employment of foreigners,
b) customs administration - this is a comprehensive application of customs regulations, trade policy measures and formalities in the import and export of goods,
c) collection and enforcement of pecuniary benefits imposed by other public administration bodies within the framework of divided administration,
d) activities of a police authority (authorized customs authorities) in proceedings on criminal offenses committed in violation of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is a tax administrator.
The scope of competencies (concurrence of control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, but there are economies of scale, as the public administration does not have to spend on the position of the control group for each subject of control separately.
At the same time, the administrative burden on inspected persons is reduced by repeated inspections.
10 From 1 December 2016, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic also performs the competence to verify the fulfillment of obligations in the registration of sales (§ 2 para. 2 of Act No. 112/2016 Coll., On the registration of sales) and from 1 January 2017 the supervision of compliance with the Act. and the conditions for the operation of gambling, including the imposition of sanctions (Section 116 of Act No. 186/2016 Coll., on gambling).
As part of the Modernization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic project, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed the three-tier structure to a two-tier structure with effect from 1 January 2013, while the middle article of the procedure (customs directorates) was abolished.
The GDC spent approximately CZK 51 million (ie approximately € 2,031,000) on the project.
Since 1 January 2013, the CS CR consists of the GDC and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and organizational units of the state.
Customs offices and their competencies are stipulated by law, excise taxes are administered by all customs offices through departments and territorial offices.
Territorial workplaces are internal organizational units of customs offices.
The Ministry of Finance is authorized to establish and abolish territorial workplaces and determine their material scope by a decree.
Legal regulations do not stipulate any competences for territorial workplaces; territorial workplaces perform the competencies of the customs office on its behalf.
Organizational structure until 31 December 2012
Organizational structure since 1 January 2013
Until 31 December 2012, the administration of excise duties was performed by the GDC, eight CAs and 58 CA departments (including branches), ie a total of 67 departments and divisions.
As of 1 January 2016, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the GDC and 51 departments at the CA and their territorial workplaces, as well as eight workplaces of the GDC legal department and CA departments providing mobile supervision, ie approximately 60 positions.
The costs of the CS CR most significantly affect wage expenditures.
As a result of the reorganization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there were no savings in human resources.
The performance of the main processes is ensured by customs officers in an employment relationship in accordance with the Act on the Employment of Members of the Security Forces.
The possibility to reduce the numbers of these members in the Czech Republic is very limited, because according to the provisions of § 42 paragraph 1 of Act No. 361/2003 Coll., On the employment of members of the security forces, they can be dismissed from employment only in exhaustively defined cases.
Reduction of posts due to organizational changes in the security corps is not a reason for dismissal and the employer is obliged to provide members with appropriate posts within the corps, or to secure posts with another security corps (eg Police, Prison Services), otherwise reassign them to the advance for the temporarily unclassified, in which members of the security forces are entitled to 80% of the average service income according to the law.

Organizational structure of the excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic
As part of the program statement for 2012 to 2016, the Government of the Slovak Republic has set as one of its priorities the completion of tax administration reform through the UNITAS program, which will provide additional budgetary resources by unifying the collection of taxes, duties and levies and suppressing tax evasion.
In this context, the tax reform was implemented at the central level, which resulted in the merger of the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic into the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the creation of a financial administration.
The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic was established on 1 January 2012 by Act No. 333/2011 Coll., On state administration bodies in the field of taxes, fees and customs, as amended, as a budgetary organization based in Banská Bystrica and connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
The FR SR, the CA and the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration in the sense of Act No. 199/2004 Coll., The Customs Act and on Amendments to Certain Acts, as amended, are customs authorities if they perform tasks pursuant to customs regulations.
Pursuant to Act No. 333/2011 Coll., On state administration bodies in the area of ​​taxes, fees and customs, as amended, together with the tax authorities they form the financial administration.
The new organizational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, the Competence Center for Financial Operations, tax offices, the Tax Office for selected tax entities, branches of tax offices, contact points of tax offices, customs offices, branches of customs offices (tax office, tax office, combined office, customs office) and customs station.
The main mission of the FR SR is to efficiently collect and administer taxes and duties, ie also excise taxes, to fulfill the revenue part of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.
The statutory body of the FR SR is the President of the Financial Administration, who is appointed and removed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
The President of the Financial Administration is responsible for the activities of the entire financial administration, and thus also for the activities of the FR SR, which he manages and represents in full.
Organizational structure of the FR SR from 1 January 2012 in abbreviated form
Within all customs offices in the territory of the Slovak Republic, activities and processes in the area of ​​excise tax administration are provided not only by customs offices (38 branches) and customs offices (18 stations) but also by excise departments (9 departments) and legal departments (9 departments).

Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
Within the organizational structure of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic, in 2015, in addition to the FR SR, the administration of excise duties was dealt with by 74 organizational units with a total number of 1,300 employees; these departments are managed by almost 48,000 tax entities.
Within the organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, in 2015 the administration of excise duties was dealt with by approximately 60 organizational units with a total number of 1,011 employees, which are managed by approximately 114,000 tax entities.
In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual activities of the excise tax administration is divided between several personnel-independent departments.
Their mutual coordination and cooperation is handled through middle and top management.
In the Slovak Republic, the performance of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax control) in the area of ​​excise tax administration is divided between the excise tax department and the customs office branch, within which the same employees of the tax administrator often deal with this agenda.
Evaluation
In the Slovak Republic, approximately one third of the number of tax subjects per total number of employees in the area of ​​excise tax administration is compared to the situation in the Czech Republic; the impact of a larger number of employees on the efficiency of excise administration is not clear.
EMCS system
According to the preamble to Decision No 1152/2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 establishing an electronic system for the movement and tracking of excisable products, the aim of introducing an electronic tracking system for selected products was to to carry out the prescribed controls, to facilitate the intra-Community movement of goods under suspension of excise duty.
When introducing the system, Member States should allow economic operators, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises active in the sector, to use these national elements at the lowest possible cost.
Article 3 of that EP and Council Decision allows for the inclusion in the EMCS of national specifications, national databases forming part of the system and such hardware or software as the Member State considers necessary to ensure full use of the system in its administration.
EMCS in the Czech Republic
Development and functionality of the EMCS system
In the Czech Republic, the EMCS system was preceded by the Selected Product Registration (EVV) system, which was operated from May 2004 until the end of March 2010.
EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1 April 2010 and is continuously supplemented with European and national functionalities (see Annex No. 5).
The so-called customs module and declarant module were introduced in the Czech Republic.
The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.
In addition to the Community system, in the Czech Republic, the EMCS system monitors shipments in the regime of conditional tax exemption initiated and terminated in the Czech Republic.
After approval of the notification of receipt of a consignment intended for a single consignee for a single receipt, the system ensures the automatic sending of information to the register of tax subjects with the subsequent revocation of the permit.
The system fully ensures the administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO, including the sending of responses with an attachment in any format and the provision of translations.
It is also possible to receive a message on the manual termination of the export in ECS (in the EU, only the forwarding of the automatically generated message is implemented).
Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.
The EMCS will not allow the approval of an e-AD or notification of acceptance without a response from the competent customs authority to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).
The declarant module is available free of charge for tax subjects, it takes the form of a web application in which the user logs in with the username and password (coordinates) that are assigned to him after registration with the CS CR.
Each action against the EMCS customs module must be provided with a valid electronic signature in the declaring EMCS module.
The declarant module allows tax subjects to directly record data on started and completed transports in the conditional tax exemption regime, and thus tax subjects do not have to spend funds to acquire the system.
The national functionalities of the declarant module enable reading and storing data off-line (saves time for frequently used data), filling in recipient data based on SEED ID control and requiring mandatory filling in of data that is optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).
The system also makes it possible to block the provision of excise duty in the corresponding amount of taxable performance for each consignment sent from the Czech Republic in real time until the end of the transport.
The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by the EMCS system.
Without a sufficient amount of security, it is not possible to send the e-AD proposal from the EMCS declarant module for approval to the office of departure.
Each warranty has a unique number and includes the ARC of the shipment (including the amount of the blocked security) for which it was used.
The taxable person can manage his guarantees directly in the declarant module EMCS, where he sees the current amount of blocked and unblocked excise tax guarantees.
Expenditure on setting up and using the EMCS
The development of the EMCS was carried out on the basis of eight performance contracts from 2006 to 2017 in the total amount of CZK 46,791,924.60 (ie € 1,761,412.56) excluding VAT.
In accordance with the concluded contracts, the contractor issued invoices from 2006 to the end of 2015 for the total amount of CZK 43,577,255.19 (ie € 1,640,401.10) excluding VAT.
In the audited period, expenses in the amount of CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (ie € 547,438.99) were incurred to upgrade the EMCS system.
The amount spent on the EMCS upgrade in the audited period and converted to one transport inserted into the EMCS is on average CZK 16.49 (ie € 0.62), excluding national transport, these expenditures are calculated per transport between the Czech Republic and EU Member States 24 .40 CZK (ie 0.92 €).
EMCS technical support was provided on the basis of four performance contracts from 2011 to 2017.
By the end of 2015, the total amount of technical support in the amount of CZK 7,499,675 (ie € 281,389.77), including value added tax, was invoiced.
The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 on one transport submitted to the EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (ie € 0.23).
The invoices for development and technical support related to the national solution and they were used to develop the EVV application, which was already operated by the GDC before the EMCS system itself.
Invoices were paid as part of program funding from national sources.
Technical support is invoiced as part of the supply of services and for other applications provided by the supplier for the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
EMCS in SR
The EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor the movement of excise goods between Member States under a duty suspension arrangement.
It replaced the accompanying administrative document - SAD, which was used before the effectiveness of this system, thus ensuring better control and management of traffic.
It has been introduced in the Slovak Republic since 1 April 2010 and is continuously supplemented with requirements arising from EU legislation.
A unique reference code is generated for each transport, so-called
ARC code, under which the traffic can be monitored online, ie in real time.
Development and functionality of the EMCS system
The EMCS system ensures the receipt and dispatch of excise goods only by those taxable persons who are authorized to use the EMCS system, which greatly reduces the risk of tax evasion.
The biggest development of functionalities occurred in 2011, when the EMCS system was fully put into operation (see Annex No. 6).
Expenditure on setting up and using the EMCS
The introduction of the EMCS system was implemented as another module of the SysNeD application equipment, and therefore it is not possible to determine exactly the amount of costs for its initial application on the Slovak side.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
The aim of the EMCS was to replace a system based on paper administration.
The benefit of the EMCS system is a comprehensive overview of transport between individual Member States within the EU from the announcement of the start of transport to its end - a significant reduction in administrative costs for tax administrations and tax entities for processing, transmitting and archiving documents.
In the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic, a national functionality was introduced into the EMCS system enabling the monitoring of traffic in a conditional system between two places in the Czech Republic, resp. in SR.
In addition, automatic monitoring and excise guarantee functionality is applied in the Czech Republic.
A national functionality is also introduced, which monitors the riskiness of the tax subject, resp. transport, followed by a mandatory response from the tax administrator.
The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic register a comparable number of transports within the EU in the EMCS system.
However, expenditures in the Slovak Republic on the upgrade of this system in the years 2012 to 2015 were € 744,310.01 higher than in the Czech Republic.
The SAO SR obtained data from the FR SR of the upgrade of the EMCS system only for the period from 2011, although this system was introduced and operated earlier.
Nevertheless, the expenses incurred for the upgrade of the EMCS system in the Slovak Republic were by € 188,134.44 higher than the expenses for the introduction and upgrade of the EMCS system for about ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.
Evaluation
During the audited period, the volume of expenditures related to the upgrade of the EMCS system in the Slovak Republic in terms of one shipment 2.3 times exceeds the expenditures of the same type in the Czech Republic.
Conclusion
The cooperation between the SAO CR and the SAO SR met the objectives.
Both control institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the system of excise tax administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
It was found that despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences in both tax systems that affect the efficiency of excise administration.
During parallel audits, examples of good practice were identified that could help reduce tax fraud, and their importance will increase with increasing tax rates.
Procedures have also been identified to reduce the costs of excise administration.
Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons, unless mutually coordinated in-depth inspections are carried out at the tax administrator.
The role of supreme audit institutions in this is irreplaceable.
Report on the results of the parallel control of the value added tax administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Foreword
The 1977 Lima Declaration emphasizes that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) have the power to audit all public financial transactions.
The declaration calls for tax revenues to be controlled as much as possible.
The European Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers the tax to be one of the most important components of public revenue.
VI. The EUROSAI Congress, held in Bonn in 2005, dealt with the audit of public revenues carried out by the SAI.
An important step on the way to optimizing the SAI's control activities is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenues.
This concerns in particular taxes as the largest source of public revenue, which is most prone to large losses.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may to some extent be unable to carry out control activities without the cooperation of another state's SAIs.
An example is the audit of internationally organized fraud, which causes significant revenue losses in many countries.
In order to combat this crime, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.
SAIs that carry out inspections in this area must be willing to work more closely together.
Right on VI. The EUROSAI Congress in Bonn gave rise to the idea of ​​carrying out an audit of the value added tax ('VAT') administration and the VIES system in cooperation with the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof.
Careful preparation followed, when both parties first had to get acquainted with the legal environment and procedures for VAT administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Based on the analysis of this information, a selection of control topics was made, which were included in the control program.
Achieving efficient and effective VAT administration is a long-term challenge and individual states (especially the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve, simplify and make the collection of this tax more transparent.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrations, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the system of international information exchange.
Report on the results of parallel inspections of the value added tax administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Inspection number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of inspection:
(CZ) Administration of value added tax after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(D) Verification of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004
Objective of the inspection:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of financial authorities in the administration of value added tax after the Czech Republic's integration into the single internal market of the European Union ("EU") associated with the free movement of goods and services and to verify the use of VIES, in particular when monitoring the exercise of the right to exemption from value added tax in intra-Community supplies.
(D) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of control of intra-Community value added tax with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the above-mentioned regulations.
The result should be a report on the weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.
Value Added Information Exchange System The inspections were carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter "SAO") and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter "BRH") in mutual cooperation on the basis of an agreement concluded between the two auditing institutions on 8 June 2006. .
The cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected business transactions carried out between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter "CR") and the Federal Republic of Germany ("Germany"), the use of information obtained through international cooperation between tax administrations and comparison of VAT administration systems of both countries. .
The joint final report on the results of audits was prepared in accordance with European Directive No. 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period was the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
The parallel control in the area of ​​VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was performed on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.
In addition to the main point - the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 - the audit covered other topics, such as taxpayer registration, VAT returns and recapitulative statements, which are closely connected with the main point.
In addition, the audit included the legal situation in the field of international bus and coach transport and the comparison of some statistics.
A comparison of the VAT administration systems of the two countries revealed differences in the following areas:
1) VAT registration.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers are assigned only one tax identification number, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, taxpayers are assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for business transactions in Germany.
If a German taxpayer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As different ways of registration cause problems, conditions should be balanced across the EU (see 4.1).
2) International bus passenger transport.
In the Czech Republic, international bus transport of passengers is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, part of the transport that takes place on German territory is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonize the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of VAT (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns for VAT.
While in the Czech Republic taxpayers file VAT returns only for individual tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany taxpayers are obliged to file so-called preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year they must file an annual VAT return. .
Unlike in the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to file preliminary tax returns electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns in the Czech Republic electronically would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary reports.
While in the Czech Republic the payers submit summary reports to the tax authorities, in Germany the payers submit summary reports to the CLO.
The tax authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have the data from the summary reports available immediately after their submission.
The German tax authorities only have the information from the recapitulative statements available after they have been processed at the CLO.
The fight against VAT fraud requires that up-to-date information on intra-Community transactions be made available as soon as possible.
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements would shorten the time lag between the date of the transaction and the update of the data in VIES.
This would then allow for a timely verification of taxation in the Member State of origin (see 4.4).
This would, however, require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for the recapitulative statement.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
The Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for received requests for information.
The German CLO does not follow the elapsed time.
As a result, the German tax administration processed a significantly lower percentage of applications received within the deadline.
Due to these problems, the BRH recommended that the German CLO carry out a permanent alert (see 4.6).
6) Risk management system.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS), which has its strengths and weaknesses.
The SAO and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, both SAIs examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.
Together with the use of the legislation for the CLO, thirty-one cases of business transactions were examined, in which there were doubts about their execution or suspicion of VAT evasion.
It was found that:
In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained through international cooperation and assessed the VAT liability of taxpayers.
In these cases, the payers either unjustifiably claimed the right to exemption of the supply from VAT, or did not admit the acquisition of goods in the VAT return.
In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used due to different legal provisions in both Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to a request for information.
Cases were found where payers incorrectly reported business transactions in recapitulative statements.
As a result, the data in VIES were incorrect and the tax administrations had to examine these cases (see 6.).
The course of the control action
The course of control action in the Czech Republic
The inspection was carried out in the period from June 2006 to March 2007 by Department II - Department of State Budget Revenues and Territorial Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter "MoF") and 10 tax offices - the Tax Office in Humpolec, the Tax Office in Jihlava, the Tax Office in Kadan, the Tax Office in Liberec, the Tax Office in Nymburk, the Tax Office in Otrokovice, the Tax Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 4, the Financial Office in Sokolov and the Financial Office in Třinec.
The audit conclusion from this audit was approved by the SAO Board on 23 April 2007.
The course of the control action in Germany
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the Indirect Taxation Audit Group and the staff of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
The inspection was part of the inspection plan for 2006 and was therefore notified to the Federal Ministry of Finance in 2006.
After the testing phase, the inspection started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases of selected BRHs and later elected SAOs, BRH had to notify a number of federal states of inspections.
In addition to interviews with the Federal Ministry of Finance and the CLO, inspections were carried out in the following Länder:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
The tax files of the following tax authorities were included:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FI for corporations / legal entities (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-center (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-north (Hamburg-Nord) and Hamburg for large companies (Hamburg für Großunternehmen), Hannover-Nord (Hannover-north), Winsen-Luhe, Bonn center (Bonn- Innenstadt), Cologne (Köln-Mitte), Cologne-Porz (Köln-Porz), Cologne South (Köln-Süd), Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen (Bautzen), Chemnitz South (Chemnitz-Süd), Dresden II (Dresden II), Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
In addition, negotiations took place with the Augsburg-Stadt tax office, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The report on control findings was submitted to the Ministry of Finance in May 2007.
Cooperation of both control institutions
As part of the preparation of parallel inspections, several meetings of representatives of both inspection institutions took place in the period before their commencement.
The participants of these meetings got acquainted with the organization of tax administrations, with the legislative regulation of VAT issues and with the system of VAT administration in both countries.
At the meeting held in May 2006, the topics of the testing phase were agreed.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at another joint meeting in August 2006.
During this meeting, a schedule for further work was agreed and the following topics for parallel inspections were identified:
1. Registration of VAT payers.
2.
International bus passenger transport - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, especially the procedure of tax administrators in processing requests for information and examination of selected problematic cases listed in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns for VAT.
5.
Summary reports.
6.
Statistical data on delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the field of VAT.
At the joint audit day of the SAO and the BRH, which took place in December 2006, both parties became acquainted with the course of the audit in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of parallel audits to date.
A report on the results of parallel inspections of the VAT administration between the Czech Republic and Germany was prepared at a working meeting in July 2007.
4. Administration of value added tax in the Czech Republic and Germany
Registration of payers in the Czech Republic
A) Payers who have their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., On the Administration of Taxes and Fees (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 337/1992 Coll.”), A tax subject means a taxpayer, a taxpayer and the legal successor of a natural or legal person who is a tax entity defined by law.
As of 31 December 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.
As of 1 December 2005, the number of tax entities registered for VAT increased to 457,590.
A taxable person who has his registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) in the next 12 consecutive calendar months, becomes a payer from the 1st day of the third month following month in which it exceeded the registration limit (Section 94, Paragraph 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”).
This person is obliged to submit the application for registration within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not allow the registration of a taxable person so-called retroactively in cases where the reason for registration is exceeding the legal limit for registration.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to deduct may become a taxpayer, even if he does not exceed CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) if he fulfills any of the other conditions specified in Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the conditions stipulated by law may apply for VAT registration voluntarily.
By delivering the application for registration to the locally competent tax administrator, the registration procedure is initiated pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll.
The voluntary VAT payer shall also state on the VAT registration application the date on which he applies for registration as a VAT payer.
The tax administrator will check the data communicated by the tax subject, ie the completed application for registration with all attachments.
If he has doubts about the data, he shall invite the taxable person to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.
After verifying that the tax entity meets the conditions for registration, the tax administrator will issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the tax entity is registered and has been assigned a tax identification number (hereinafter "VAT number").
The tax administrator shall state on the certificate the effective date of the VAT registration and the periodicity of the VAT tax period.
The tax period is a calendar quarter if the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year did not reach CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).
If the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the tax period is a calendar month.
A payer whose turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax period and will notify the tax administrator of this change.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
The assignment of a VAT number in a registration certificate is always of a constitutive nature and the tax subject is obliged to state it in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases where a special law so provides (eg Act No. 235/2004 Coll. issuance of tax documents).
The VAT number contains the code "CZ" and the main part, which consists of a general identifier.
The general identifier for a natural person is the birth number, or another general identifier, if so provided by a special law, and in the case of a legal entity, an identification number (provisions of Section 33, Paragraph 12 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.).
If the tax entity has not fulfilled its registration obligation even at the request of the tax administrator, the locally competent tax administrator shall register it ex officio without delay.
The result of the registration procedure is the issuance of a Certificate of Registration ex officio, which is delivered to the tax subject.
In the Czech Republic, a tax entity that has obtained a business license is assigned a VAT number at the time of its first registration for any tax.
The tax entity uses the same VAT number even if it is registered as a VAT payer.
Pursuant to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., Which is effective from 1 January 2005, the tax administrator may, in the event of non-compliance with the VAT registration obligation, impose on the taxable person compensation up to 10% of total income or income for taxable transactions. , which this person carried out unjustifiably without tax, for the period from the date on which he was supposed to be a registered payer by law to the date on which he became a registered payer based on the decision of the tax administrator (provisions of § 98 par. 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Sb.).
Payment of the amount thus determined is considered a tax payment (Section 98, Paragraph 3 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), Ie it is not a sanction.
Cancellation of the VAT payer's registration if the conditions stipulated by law are met is possible for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of registration at the request of the payer, mainly due to the amount of turnover that does not reach the registration limit (§ 106 paragraph 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
The payer is entitled to apply for cancellation of the registration at the earliest after 1 year from the effective date stated on the registration certificate.
2) Cancellation of registration “ex officio” (Section 106, Paragraph 7 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), If: a) the taxpayer has not performed without notification of a reason to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months of performance, b) the payer fails to fulfill his obligations arising from Act No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.
B) Payers who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State who does not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic or a foreign taxable person who carries out transactions with the place of supply in the country and is a person obliged to declare and pay tax on this performance pursuant to Section 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (so-called “non-established payer”), becomes the payer on the day of this performance.
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration to the Tax Office for Prague 1 no later than the date of the performance.
In the application for registration, she is obliged to state all VAT numbers that have been assigned to her in other Member States or in a third country.
If a "non-established" payer submits an application for registration later than on the date of the first taxable supply in the Czech Republic, the Tax Office for Prague 1 will register it retroactively, because according to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax entity became a VAT payer on the day of the first taxable supply in the Czech Republic.
During retroactive registration, the Tax Office for Prague 1 requires from tax subjects proof that the performance has been performed (invoices or explanatory letters).
If a “non-established” tax entity applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable supply takes place, then the Tax Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts that the supply will take place.
As at 31 December 2004, 473 “non-established” payers were registered at the Tax Office for Prague 1, of which 124 were payers from Germany, and as at 31 December 2005, 951 “non-established” payers were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 106, Paragraph 9 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of a “non-established” taxpayer as of 31 January of the following calendar year, if this taxpayer did not incur any obligation to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.
The SAO's inspection revealed that if a “non-established” taxpayer files a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, ie in accordance with the legal regulation within the deadline for filing a tax return, the tax office often does not have it available on 31 January.
In cases where the facts decisive for the possibility of canceling the registration with the tax office are known later than 31 January, it is no longer possible in the Czech Republic to cancel the VAT registration in a given calendar year.
Registration of payers in Germany
Due to the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (§§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter "AO"), anyone who carries out business activities is obliged to inform the city / municipal authority or the relevant tax office.
The deadline for submitting information is one month after starting a business.
This information is processed by the city / municipal office for the tax office.
If the tax office finds a company that has started an activity but has not registered, the relevant tax office can register this payer ex officio - even retroactively.
Taxpayers who are both tax residents and non-tax residents are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in § 2 of the German VAT Act ("UStG").
This obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover they generate.
There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.
There are special tax offices for entrepreneurs living abroad.
For example, for those based in the Czech Republic, the relevant Tax Office is Chemnitz-Süd.
As of April 30, 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office; as of March 1, 2006, a total of 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.
The BRH found that these special tax authorities often refused to register so-called semi-independent freelancers based in the new eastern EU member states.
As work permits for employees from the ten new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these freelancers have tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.
These companies do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs laid down in Paragraph 2 of the UStG, as they are usually dependent on a single employer who determines their working hours and the way in which they carry out their work.
In order to register, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire of the relevant tax office, in which he must provide information about the company and the activities he performs.
The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding for all tax authorities in Germany.
It is processed either by special departments of tax authorities or by departments with a general focus, which are responsible for assessing taxpayers.
This form is used to assess the risk of individual taxpayers before the tax office issues a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is governed by certain rules:
The first three digits provide information on the relevant tax office, the next three (or four) provide information on the relevant department at the tax office, the other five (or four) are to distinguish payers, the last being always the check digit.
If an entrepreneur intends to engage in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID in order to receive a tax-exempt intra-Community supply.
The CLO assigns a VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and if he has a tax number for VAT purposes.
The CLO automatically assigns VAT IDs to businesses when taxpayers indicate an intra-Community supply in their VAT return.
The VAT ID structure is a country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur may be canceled: 1. at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business activity), after all administrative work has been carried out (assessment for all financial years) and 2. if the tax administration realizes that he is no longer in business .
The validity of a VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of a VAT number.
In these cases, the tax authorities are obliged to inform the CLO about the cancellation of the tax number so that the CLO can terminate the validity of the VAT identification number.
Under the German VAT law (§ 19 (1) UStG), tax residents in Germany are not required to pay VAT if 1. the turnover plus applicable VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2. it is unlikely to exceed EUR 50 000 in the following year .
So-called small entrepreneurs ("Kleinunternehmer") are not entitled to invoice VAT to other entrepreneurs and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
Although they are not obliged to pay VAT, small businesses must be registered with the tax office and must file an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur may declare that he will not apply the provisions of Paragraph 19 (1) of the UStG.
This declaration is binding on him for the next five years.
The entrepreneur can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.
For tax non-residents, it is possible to appoint tax representatives (§ 22a UStG).
It is a prerequisite that they carry out exclusively tax-exempt business transactions and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
The function of a tax representative is to fulfill the tax obligations of a foreign entrepreneur, who does not have to register for VAT.
Invoices must include information on representation for tax purposes.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.
If the tax subject in the Czech Republic does not exceed the set limit, it has the option to apply for VAT registration voluntarily.
The registration procedure is standardized in Germany, but as a result of different organizational models in the federal states, differences may occur.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer is assigned a VAT number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
If the payer registers for VAT, he uses the same VAT number for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxpayer is assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for business transactions in Germany.
If a German taxpayer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As the SAO and the BRH have found, the German two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration for intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax office about their business.
This retroactive registration allows the correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax period, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.
As different ways of registration cause problems, conditions should be balanced across the EU.
The German Parliament has recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (TIN).
The Federal Tax Office will assign a VAT number at the birth of a natural person.
This VAT number will be valid for the entire life of a natural person who is a German resident.
If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax office will ask for an economic VAT number, which will be used as a VAT ID.
In the future, there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the assignment of the VAT ID.
Work on the introduction of an IT tool for VAT number management has not yet been completed.
International bus passenger transport
Legal regulation in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. With effect from 1 May 2004, the transport of persons between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct tax.
This transport is exempt from VAT, even if it is carried out by traders who are registered for tax purposes in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.
Return transport is considered a separate transport.
If "non-established" tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than international bus transport of persons, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as VAT payers.
International passenger transport was exempt from VAT in the Czech Republic on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, chap. Article 5 (1) (a) (b) where it is stated:
"For the purposes of Article 28 (3) (a), (b) of Directive 77/388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may continue to exempt from value added tax in respect of the international carriage of passengers pursuant to point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or the exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier. "
Description of legislation in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in § 3b (1) of the German VAT Act, the place of supply of passenger transport (ie transport services) is the route (ie the place) where the transport takes place .
The German tax system therefore does not distinguish between national and international cross-border passenger transport.
Only that part of the route which takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable supply of transport in Germany.
The German tax system also does not distinguish between tax residents and non-residents.
If a tax non-resident transports passengers via Germany, then that part of the route which takes place in Germany also constitutes a taxable supply of transport.
Before performing his services in Germany, a tax non-resident must notify his intention to provide passenger transport to the relevant tax office.
The tax office will register this tax non-resident for tax (cf. 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for any bus or coach listed in the taxpayer's notice.
The taxpayer is obliged to declare his taxable supplies of transport in the German VAT return.
As of March 1, 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office registered 741 Czech payers who were engaged in passenger transport.
If the transport of passengers is provided to a tax resident who is a person liable for VAT, the tax non-resident does not have to pay VAT to the tax office himself.
Instead, the entity liable to pay VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer is the resident tax resident; this process is known as "reverse charge" and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC.
In addition to the notification of a non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return, the German tax authorities have several means of assessing the correctness of the taxable supplies of passenger transport services granted.
The mobile control groups of the customs office audit the certificates of buses with a permit (license) for foreign transport, which are used for the transport of passengers through Germany.
After each audit, the mobile audit teams send an audit report to the relevant tax office.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile inspection team is entitled to demand payment of VAT from the bus driver before continuing with the next transport.
A tax non-resident may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax calculated in his VAT return.
If the tax office has doubts as to the accuracy of the VAT return, it may announce its intention to carry out an audit, which must be carried out at the tax office's office, or it may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 ( see 4.6).
Even if a non-resident taxpayer refuses to pay the amount of VAT assessed in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may request administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308 / EEC.
If a VAT return or non-resident's tax obligations are to be reviewed, the BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too labor-intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable passenger services.
In particular, an audit of a non-resident's tax accounts incurs disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.
The tax administration must carry out an audit of foreign accounting, which means not only the need for knowledge of a foreign language, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.
An audit of this type is also likely to require more time than an audit of a tax resident, but this audit is limited to the provision of passenger transport that takes place in Germany.
On the other hand, a tax non-resident may not only accept the right to carry out an inspection, which belongs to his national tax administration, but also the right to carry out an audit by other Member States in which he carries passengers.
In addition, in each Member State in which there is only one supply of passenger transport, the taxpayer is required to comply with all the tax obligations applicable to him in those Member States, in all the languages ​​and on all the tax forms of those Member States.
Actual taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore imposes disproportionate bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation in both countries is different.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between individual EU member states, resp. between Member States and third countries, on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, exempt from VAT with the right to deduct tax.
In Germany, the part of the transport that takes place on German territory is a taxable supply.
If this transport is provided for the first time by a non-established payer in Germany, he is obliged to notify the relevant tax office in advance of the provision of the transport.
The tax office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to declare in Germany the taxable provision of part of the transport in the tax return.
The implementation of the law is very time consuming in Germany.
At least three of the four Czech payers registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office are engaged in passenger transport.
Compared to the effort, the tax revenue, if realized, is rather low.
Member States which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT are burdened with time-consuming obligations without a financially sensitive result.
In order to avoid disproportionate VAT costs, the supply of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in only one Member State.
This could be the country where the shipment starts or where the provider is located.
Such taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112 / EC.
Tax returns for VAT
Filing and processing of tax returns for VAT in the Czech Republic
The payer is obliged to file a VAT return within 25 days after the end of the tax period on the form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, even if he has not incurred a tax liability, unless otherwise provided by law.
The actual tax liability is payable within the deadline for filing a VAT return, with the exception of the tax assessed in connection with the import of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., For which the tax due date is determined by customs regulations.
If a refund of the over - deduction results in a refundable overpayment, it shall be returned to the payer without request within 30 days of the assessment of the over - deduction.
The time limit does not apply in cases where the tax administrator initiates tax proceedings concerning the taxpayer's tax liability.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 73, Paragraph 11 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the right to deduct tax can be exercised in a regular VAT return no later than for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct tax could have been exercised.
After the expiration of this period, the right to deduct tax can be further exercised within 3 years from the end of the tax period in which the right to deduct tax could have been exercised at the earliest.
However, this is only possible by filing an additional VAT return.
Amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. effective from 1 January 2005, it allows the filing of an additional tax return for VAT only for the period when the right to deduct tax could be exercised for the first time.
The taxpayer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if a) increases the tax liability by the sum of corrections, b) makes a correction that does not change the last known tax liability, but only the data previously claimed by the tax entity, c) corrects the tax rate and amount according to § 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
The taxpayer can submit an additional tax return for VAT if he reduces the tax liability by the sum of corrections.
The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return by the end of the month following the discovery of these facts.
The filing of a VAT tax return in electronic form can be done either via the Internet or on a technical data carrier.
Submission via the Internet can be performed as a submission with a data message provided with a guaranteed electronic signature or as a submission with a data message without a guaranteed electronic signature.
In the case of submission with a data message not provided with a guaranteed electronic signature, submission in writing is still required, ie delivery of a computer report to the tax administrator (e-form).
The VAT return contains separate lines concerning the values ​​of intra-Community supplies / acquisitions of goods.
The values ​​of the acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Some lines are used for the purpose of the initial automated control within the ADIS system.
The values ​​of supplies of goods to other Member States to persons registered for tax purposes in other Member States are compared with the data given in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers.
The values ​​of acquisitions of goods from other Member States from taxable persons in other Member States are compared with the values ​​obtained through VIES from recapitulative statements of payers from other EU Member States.
The tax office is carrying out a test of the credibility of tax returns for VAT within the ADIS system.
This test is performed automatically, as VAT returns cannot be assessed without performing the test.
The credibility test includes the calculation of credibility criteria and the evaluation of risky types of VAT tax returns.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 37, Paragraph 1 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll. the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who fails to fulfill a non-monetary obligation arising from this or a special tax law or imposed by a decision pursuant to this law within a specified period.
Automated tax information system, which the FI uses for technical support of tax administration.
The SAO's audit revealed that the tax authorities generally did not use the option to impose a fine on taxpayers for failing to file a VAT return.
Filing and processing of tax returns for VAT in Germany
In Germany, we distinguish between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are required to submit preliminary VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.
Even small businesses who are not required to pay VAT must file an annual tax return.
In general, taxpayers are required to submit a quarterly VAT return by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which the VAT is incurred (Paragraph 18 (2) of the UStG).
However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6,136 in the previous calendar year or in the case of a newly established business, the relevant entrepreneur is obliged to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day of the following month.
A taxpayer may also decide to file a monthly VAT return if a tax refund of more than EUR 6 136 has been made in the previous year (Paragraph 18 (2a) UStG).
VAT returns do not have to be submitted if the amount of annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.
The relevant amount of VAT liability must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT arose.
The tax refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FI.
There are no deadlines (according to the law) for processing tax returns and refunding excessive VAT deductions.
For the purpose of timely tax refund, it is possible to offer security for the amount to be refunded.
The basic principle is to process VAT returns and return the tax quickly.
The German VAT law provides for the possibility of extending that period (Paragraph 18 (6) of the UStG).
Such an extension must be requested separately.
It allows you to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant VAT liability one month later, provided that a special advance is paid in the case of a monthly return.
This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT liability.
Whenever an error is detected, the entrepreneur must file a corrective VAT return.
There is no additional VAT return.
Once the annual VAT return, which must be filed by 31 May of the following calendar year, is registered with the tax office, the entrepreneur cannot correct an erroneous preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT return.
Correction of the annual VAT return in favor or against the payer is possible during the following 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.
After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally only be corrected in cases of tax fraud or evasion.
Payers are required to file preliminary VAT returns electronically.
Tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule to avoid undue hardship.
The submission of an annual VAT return is possible in paper form or via the Internet, either with or without certification.
If it is done without certification, the payer must submit the declaration once again on paper with personal signatures.
If the payer does not file a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.
In case of late submission, a penalty may be imposed on the payer (maximum 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25,000).
During the previous inspection, the BRH found that the tax authorities often did not impose this standard fine.
In other cases where the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
Therefore, the standard fine does not meet its objective of reducing the average delay, especially when filing an annual VAT return.
The VAT return contains separate lines relating to the values ​​of intra-Community supplies / acquisitions of goods.
The values ​​of the acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Non-taxable transactions must be reported on a separate line in the tax return / VAT.
In the case of VAT returns submitted on paper, copies must be made either through a scanner or by specially authorized staff.
Data from VAT returns submitted electronically are immediately available to a tax office employee.
Once all the data has been entered into the system, the RMS staff will go through it and select cases that meet certain criteria.
Selected VAT returns must be checked by an employee of the tax office on the basis of an inspection report prepared by the system.
(see section 5.2).
Although the tax administration must roughly estimate the amount of VAT that the taxpayer must pay, the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers file a VAT return within 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the amount of the payer's turnover, the tax period is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month.
In Germany, taxpayers file preliminary tax returns for VAT, depending on the tax obligations in the previous year, either within 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or month.
Payers are required to file an annual tax return by 31 May of the following year.
The obligation to file an annual VAT return has its pros and cons:
+ at the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer is able to correct errors in (monthly preliminary) tax returns by submitting a single annual VAT return;
- if the payer corrects the granted intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be related to the period for which the recapitulative statement is submitted;
- the Länder do not normally compare VIES data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers before processing their annual VAT return.
In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3), German taxpayers are required to file an annual VAT return, regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This obligation allows the German tax authority to verify the maximum turnover limit for small businesses.
In addition, the responsible tax office is able to compare annual VAT returns with direct tax returns and final accounts.
In the Czech Republic, tax administrators are able to determine the amount of a payer's turnover only from filed income tax returns.
Unlike in the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to file VAT returns in electronic form.
The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary reports
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
The summary report (hereinafter referred to as “SH”) is submitted in accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. a taxable person who has made a supply of goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State.
Data on the value of delivered goods are always given in the Czech currency, broken down by individual tax subjects, stating their VAT IDs, under which they are registered in their country.
Data on provided services are not entered in the SH.
SH are submitted by payers with a monthly and quarterly tax period for each calendar quarter within 25 days after its end to the locally competent tax office.
Correction of erroneous data is performed in the subsequent SH within 15 days from the date of detection of errors.
Incorrect data stated in the SH are always replaced by data stated in the subsequent SH.
As well as tax returns, taxpayers can also file SH in electronic form.
In the event that the payer does not submit SH or subsequent SH and had them according to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. to submit, the tax administrator shall invite him to file it and at the same time shall instruct him on the consequences in case of non-submission of the SH or subsequent SH, ie that the tax administrator is pursuant to § 37 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll. entitled to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) for non-compliance with non-monetary obligations.
The SAO's audit revealed that the tax authorities generally did not use the option to impose a fine on payers for non-compliance with their legal obligations.
Especially in the case of filing a SH, tax subjects are not sufficiently motivated to fulfill their obligations, because failure to file a SH does not affect the VAT tax liability.
The tax administrator is obliged according to § 102 par. 5 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. check the data in the SH, or in the subsequent SH, remove any ambiguities and use the data to determine the tax liability.
In the event of a discrepancy between the data in the SH and the data in the relevant (payer with a monthly tax period) or relevant (payer with a quarterly tax period) VAT return, the tax administrator should verify the correctness of the declared tax liability stated in the VAT return.
Incorrect data in the SH shall be removed by the tax subject by submitting the subsequent SH itself, or it may be requested to do so.
The tax administrator shall correct the data on the supply of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:
- the payer does not prove the data stated in the SH (or subsequent SH), correcting them by submitting a subsequent SH,
- the tax administrator has proved that the data provided by the payer in the SH or the subsequent SH are not true.
By inserting a correction without submitting a subsequent SH, the tax administrator does not replace the taxpayer's submission, but only modifies the data in the VIES database so that they are current, complete and accurate.
SH data are sent to the Member States concerned.
They may be sent and received only by a national financial administration designated to cooperate with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Ministry of Finance, Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration (CLO).
O_MCTL is an automatic message that the CLO receives from other Member States.
Contains any incorrect VAT IDs listed in the submitted SH lines.
If an incorrect VAT ID is used in one of the transferred current SH or subsequent SH lines, an entry is made in the incorrect VAT ID table.
The table contains the so-called "VAT ID Doubt Notification".
The tax administrator checks the data and records the result of the verification in the system.
When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is obliged to declare VAT and state the values ​​of the acquisition on separate lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of discrepancies in the value of acquired goods declared by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return and in the value of delivered goods as stated by payers from other Member States in their SH are sent from the CLO to the tax office for verification.
Tax administrators are obliged to investigate irregularities.
There are three possible situations:
a) The value declared by the Czech taxpayer in the relevant lines of VAT tax returns is lower than the value of the supply declared by EU taxpayers.
In this case, the tax administrator will verify the accuracy of the data.
b) The amount of the difference is 0.
This situation can occur either by changing the data in the EU (the foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity itself submits an additional VAT return in the meantime).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administrator whether, despite this fact, he will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.
c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer stated in the relevant lines of the VAT return, is higher than the value of the delivered goods declared by the EU taxpayer.
Here, too, it is up to the administrator to verify the accuracy of the data.
After verifying the difference and clarifying the reasons for its occurrence, the tax administrator shall enter the result of the verification into ADIS.
The scan results are transferred back to the CLO.
The number of cases sent from the CLO to tax authorities for verification for individual quarters of 2005 is shown in Graph No. 1 (source note: Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases transferred from the CLO to tax authorities decreased in the individual quarters of 2005.
There was a significant decrease in the number in the 4th quarter of 2005. The CLO increased the minimum financial limit, inter alia with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.
The discrepancy between the data from VAT tax returns and the data from the EU does not always have to be caused by an error on the part of the domestic payer.
It can also be an error on the part of EU payers or an error caused by the fact that certain types of transactions may be entered in the SH in different ways in individual EU Member States.
The most common reasons for discrepancies in the values ​​of reported transactions found at audited financial authorities are listed in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or participate in tripartite transactions are required to submit quarterly SHs listing intra-Community deliveries by recipient (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The SH must be submitted by the 10th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.
If an extension of this period is allowed in the case of preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to SH.
SH must be delivered to CLO.
From 1 January 2007, they must be submitted electronically.
Exceptions may be granted by the competent tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.
In cases where taxpayers realize that incorrect data are provided in the SH, they are obliged to submit a corrective report within one month.
In the event that taxpayers do not file a SH, the CLO will initiate proceedings to enforce the submission of this report.
Part of this procedure is: - the first reminder - the second reminder associated with the threat of a fine / penalty and - the imposition of a penalty.
Although the German Tax Code allows for the imposition of a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (Paragraph 329 AO), the CLO imposes fines in three steps, in the amounts of EUR 125, 250 and 500.
In addition, Paragraph 26a (1) (5) of the UStG provides that payers act unlawfully if they deliberately or negligently fail to file the SH properly, file it incompletely, do not file it in time or if they do not correct or repair the SH at all.
This offense can be punished by a fine of up to EUR 5,000.
Data on intra-Community supplies cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office, as the processing of SH is the sole task of the CLO.
SH data is stored only in the CLO system.
Data from the SH are therefore visually available to the tax office only after their processing at the CLO.
The deadlines for processing SH are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Data from SH must be stored within three months following the relevant calendar quarter.
In case of incorrect VAT IDs in the SH of German payers, the CLO will receive the O_MCTL codes from another Member State.
The CLO contacts a specific entrepreneur and asks him for the correct data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case is referred to the relevant tax authorities.
It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct data.
During the inspection, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID at the request of the CLO.
However, the challenge, threat and imposition of three additional fines takes too much time in cases where the payer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
These cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.
The tax office rejected the exemption of reported intra-Community supplies in 73% of these cases.
When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the tax office asked him to file the corrected SH with the CLO, as the tax authorities cannot correct the data in VIES themselves.
The BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor the CLO checked the submission of the corrected SH, so that the payers often did not comply with the request.
Due to the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data, the comparison of the data on the supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in the SH will not take place before the submission of these data to the CLO of other Member States.
This control can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually applied in the preparation of a VAT control.
Data obtained from other Member States are processed at CLO.
Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and then submitted to the Member States concerned.
This data is used for the purposes of control of acquisitions by tax authorities.
Once entered into the system, the CLO checks them based on comparisons with data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control information is created and sent to the relevant tax authorities.
This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created later and submitted to the tax authorities.
The RMS installed for the purposes of the assessment procedure then checks this data with data on intra-Community acquisitions.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State file SH within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter with the locally competent tax office.
The tax authorities process the SH and transmit the data to the CLO.
The values ​​of deliveries of goods to another Member State stated by taxpayers in the SH are compared at the tax authorities with the values ​​of deliveries of goods to another Member State stated by these taxpayers in VAT tax returns.
The results of the comparison are used in the assessment procedure.
In Germany, payers who have made an intra-Community supply are required to submit a SH on a quarterly basis, by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.
SH payers submit to CLO, from 1 January 2007 in electronic form.
The tax authorities have the information from the SH available only after it has been processed at the CLO.
Payers from the Czech Republic and Germany only state the delivery of goods in the SH, the provision of services is not stated in the SH.
Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are not able to correct the erroneous lines submitted by SH themselves.
As a result of this limited access to German VIES data, the incorrect VAT ID was not corrected, even though the payer provided the FA with the correct VAT ID.
The German tax administration does not compare the data on intra-Community supplies, which are given in the VAT return of the German taxpayer and his SH.
The differences between the data of the two reports are usually not detected before the German CLO provides data from VIES to other Member States.
Given the findings of the BRH, it is clear that the comparison would increase the reliability of the transmitted data in VIES.
Data on the supply of goods to Czech taxpayers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech taxpayers in their VAT tax returns.
The comparison is performed by the CLO separately for each calendar quarter.
The most significant cases of irregularities are forwarded to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in taxpayers' tax returns.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general check is processed only for payers who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax authorities control the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other payers only if the RMS produces a control notice or if the payer is intended for control anyway.
This procedure relieves the tax authorities of the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
Combating carousel fraud requires constantly updated information on intra-Community acquisitions as soon as possible.
The current SH system, especially VIES, provides financial authorities with information that can be up to six months old.
This delay can be reduced by up to four months if payers submit SH monthly.
Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, as most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to file monthly VAT returns - and SH does not require any additional information than the tax return.
To avoid bureaucratic costs, filing a SH may be linked to filing a VAT return.
However, the obligation to submit SH on a monthly basis would cause more time discrepancies between the reporting of intra-Community supply and intra-Community acquisition and could increase the flow of data between CLOs.
In 2006, the German federal government considered the general provisions of the monthly SHs.
Its implementation failed due to the doubts of the federal states.
They feared that the monthly submission of VIES data to the CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact, if the obligation to submit monthly SHs and monthly data transmission were to be effective, a monthly update of VIES would require a European standard for monthly SHs.
Statistical data on delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the Czech Republic's most important trading partner.
The total volumes of intra-Community transactions in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Table 2.
Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous VAT numbers or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports submitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for individual quarters of the audited period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The data show significant differences.
These differences may be due to the different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO relates their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was submitted, the German CLO relates their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL message was received.
International level 3 information exchange
Implementation of international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax administrations to obtain information from other Member States concerning intra-Community commercial transactions and the payers who have carried out such transactions.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 distinguishes between two basic categories of exchange of information, namely the exchange of information on request and the exchange of information without previous applications.
The international exchange of information on request is carried out in the form of so-called requests for information (hereinafter referred to as "FDI"), using standardized SCAC forms.
Tax administrators from the Czech Republic send their ŽOI, resp. the replies to the FDI received through the CFO of the CLO, which translates the information provided on the standardized SCAC forms into a foreign language and sends it to other Member States.
The CLO also ensures the receipt of ŽOI from other Member States and the responses to sent ŽOI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the locally competent tax administrators for settlement.
Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum time limit for the processing of FDI at 3 months from the receipt of the application.
All SOIs handed over during the audited period between the Czech Republic and Germany were subject to the SAO inspection.
Out of the total number of 94 ŽOIs received in the Czech Republic from Germany, 70 cases (ie 74.5%) were settled within the set three-month period, another 23 cases (ie 24.5%) were settled after this period and for the remaining 1 case the reply was not sent to Germany until the SAO's inspection.
More detailed information on the deadlines within which responses to the ZOI received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic is given in Graph No. 2.
Out of the total number of 335 ŽOI sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 cases (ie 40.6%) received a response within the set three-month period, another 179 (ie 53.4%) requests were answered after this period and 19 cases ( ie 5.7%) the response from Germany was not delivered until the SAO's inspection (in the remaining 1 case it was not possible to determine from the submitted data when the response from Germany was delivered).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which responses to the ZOI sent to Germany were delivered to the Czech Republic is given in Graph No. 3.
The percentage expression of the values ​​of intra-community transactions, stated in the ŽOI transferred between the Czech Republic and Germany, is shown in Graph No. 4.
As can be seen from the graph above, the value of business transactions examined through the FDI was most often in the range above EUR 60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic, resp. structured automatic exchange of information, or in the form of spontaneous exchange of information.
Tax administrators from other Member States are often provided with information that may be relevant to them in the administration of VAT without prior request.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The information is transmitted electronically between Member States.
"Automatic exchange" according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request, at pre-established regular intervals.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as that information becomes available.
The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on the delivery of new means of transport in the form of an automatic exchange.
This information is available to the tax administrator from the form of the Report on the Delivery of a New Means of Transport pursuant to Section 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.
When processing the above-mentioned form, the tax administrator fills in the necessary data into a specially created template and immediately transmits it to the contact person at the financial directorate where this data is collected and within the set deadline, ie no later than two months from the end of the quarter in which the information was available to the CLO for further processing and transfer to other Member States.
Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on mail order sales, which are exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU transactions that appear to be unjustified and information on potential "missing traders".
That information is sent to other Member States in the form of a spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.
Implementation of international information exchange in Germany
In Germany, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the locally competent tax office.
The tax authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
Tax authorities were instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information in German only; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.
Half of the German requests for information inspected by the BRH were sent in order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in another Member State or to prove the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check the value of the supply of goods or services specified in the request for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.
If there is no reasonable reason for this request, the German CLO will reject any request containing an amount lower than this set limit.
In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)], if these texts are not in German or English.
To respond to a request for information, the CLO sends the request to the relevant tax office with reference to the three-month deadline.
There are no further deadlines for processing applications at specific organizational levels of the tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor elapsed time limits, it lacks sufficient staff capacity to alert the tax authorities to responding to blank information requests.
The tax authorities will obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.
Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit, which covers any taxable process over a period of several months, or a so-called VAT inspection, which can only cover one recent business transaction.
This short and typ explicit type of audit does not require any notification to the taxpayer and has proved its usefulness in investigating individual taxable business transactions.
As part of the automatic exchange without prior request, Germany provides other Member States with information - on the VAT IDs assigned to payers resident in other Member States, - on the refund of input tax to payers resident in other Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to other Member States through a structured automatic exchange:
a. Supply of new means of transport to businesses without using their VAT ID, b. dispatch or catalog sale in other Member States which is not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intra-Community acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d intra-Community supply of goods which the German payer did not report in SH because he treated the supplies as domestic transactions, e. a potential "missing trader" who carried out intra-Community transactions regardless of the validity of their VAT ID, f. traders ”or those recipients who misused their VAT ID.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of ŽOI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the Czech Republic and in Germany by the locally competent financial authorities, which send the completed SCAC form to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses the bilingual SCAC form (Czech - English) and translates the sent information into English, resp. German language, the German tax authorities follow the instruction to write the ZOI or spontaneous information only in German on a monolingual form.
The German CLO does not translate German texts.
By inspecting ZOIs submitted between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration processed 74.5% of received applications within the set three-month period, while ZOIs sent to Germany were processed by the German tax administration. within the set time limit only in 40.6% of cases.
Although the German CLO draws the attention of the tax authorities to the three-month deadline, it does not follow the elapsed deadlines.
The result of missing alerts is a large number of delayed responses to the ZOI.
Due to these problems, the BRH recommended to make regular notifications to the CLO.
The situation has already improved.
According to the latest information, the German CLO is now alerting the tax authorities to reply to unfinished replies to the FDI.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several departments at various organizational levels of the tax administration deal with VAT risk management.
Within the Ministry of Finance, the following departments deal with the issue of risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The VAT Methodology and Performance Department and within it the Risk Risk Management Department, which, among other things, manages the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates the trends of these risks at the domestic and Community level.
Nationwide, it coordinates the functioning of the role of VAT Credibility and the use of data from the VIES system in terms of the risks of tax evasion in intra-Community transactions.
Based on data from the trade balance, the Czech Republic evaluates risky commodities, conceptually processes risk management in the area of ​​VAT and cooperates in this area with the relevant EU institutions and other Member States.
The Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration, which, inter alia, ensures the exchange of information in the field of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyzes data from other Member States contained in VIES, provides public information and provides other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of the Council Regulation. (EC) No 1798/2003.
Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous VAT numbers or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports submitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for individual quarters of the audited period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The data show significant differences.
These differences may be due to the different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO relates their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was submitted, the German CLO relates their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL message was received.
The Tax Audit and Search Methodology Department, which, among other things, performs risk analysis within the methodological management of tax audits and, in accordance with risk analysis, sets priorities for tax audits in financial directorate plans, prepares risk analyzes to reduce tax evasion, including gathering knowledge gained during administration. taxes and other sources and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.
Search departments are set up in the financial directorates, which, among other things, search for tax entities and areas that are at risk of tax fraud (eg online shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), search for unregistered tax entities for tax evasion (eg in the field of internet services, job placement, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of links to chain fraud and transmission of information to territorial financial authorities.
Specialized control departments have been set up at selected 12 tax offices.
They have regional competence, tax inspections outside the territorial competence of financial authorities are performed on the basis of authorization.
The need to set up a specialized tax audit department arose on the basis of the increasing findings of new and improved forms of tax evasion, which occur mainly in entities linked to chains.
These departments focus on the control of tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities and multinational companies and tax entities of a large scope of activities in terms of turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing VAT risks have been integrated into the ADIS system: - the role Credibility of VAT returns, used to evaluate the riskiness of submitted tax returns, VIES, through which tax administrations have access to data provided from other EU Member States.
The role of VIES allows, among other things: - to verify the validity of VAT ID of payers from other Member States, - to obtain from other Member States the values ​​of goods delivered to the Czech payer, declared in SH by all his suppliers from other Member States, carry out a formal check of the data provided by payers from the Czech Republic in the SH before sending these data to other Member States, - generate a list of payers for which the data on supplies of goods to other Member States stated in VAT tax returns do not match the data in the SH, - to generate a list of taxpayers for whom the value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States stated in the VAT returns does not match the data declared in the SH by all its suppliers from other Member States.
As part of the activity to reduce the risks of tax evasion, tax administrators have access to the registers of state administration bodies such as the Commercial Register, the Real Estate Cadastre, the Register of Motor Vehicles, the Register of Trade Licensing, etc.
More detailed information is given in chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to the federal (federal) structure of Germany, the federal tax administration (especially the CLO) and the tax administrations of 16 federal states participate in the development and operation of the RMS.
Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the federal tax administrations share a fully consistent database.
At CLO level, the ST I 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as “KUSS” - the coordination unit for special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects the findings of the audit concerning tax fraud in a special database called OPUS.
KUSS, in cooperation with tax authorities, has introduced a new database called ZAUBER intended for the transmission of the names of companies of tax fraudsters "missing traders".
KUSS coordinates related cases of domestic and cross-border tax fraud.
The experience of KUSS is reflected in the development of RMS in working groups.
In addition, the specialists of several other CLO and MoF departments are entrusted with RMS-related duties and powers.
At CLO level, a formal control of the composition of VAT IDs of other Member States in the SH submitted by German payers is introduced.
This formal check is carried out before providing the data from the SH to other Member States, in order to improve the comprehensibility and use of the provided VIES data (see 4.4.2).
The validation of the VAT IDs listed in the SH is performed on the basis of the O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the procedure for correcting an invalid VAT ID, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS at CLO is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and generates several types of control reports based on several characteristics that usually appear in so-called carousel trading operations, in order to identify potential "missing traders".
The Länder tax authorities are instructed to prepare these inspection reports and, in some cases, to report on the results of their CLO findings.
The findings of the BRH audit confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all available characteristics if the existence of a tax fraud case is to be assumed with sufficient probability (instead of focusing exclusively on the company's turnover).
The BRH therefore suggested to the Ministry of Finance that various characteristics be taken into account when processing the reports.
The RMS should also address other factors, such as the taxpayer's payment behavior (morale), industry (economic activities) or shareholder structure.
The second level of RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT returns.
For example, the RMS generates a list of those taxpayers who have declared intra-Community supplies in their tax returns.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete SH submission.
In addition, this type of RMS compares intra-Community acquisitions reported in the payer's annual VAT return with VIES data.
The Länder tax administrations try to avoid comparing quarterly data, as this comparison would reveal too much inconsistent data, which is attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or fraud; for example:
- different timing of the intra-Community transaction in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand and the beneficiary on the other;
- different accounting for sales discounts and sales promotions (incentives) and their different reporting in the tax return.
In addition to comparing VAT and VIES data, many Länder have introduced RMS elements that are based on VAT data and certain other facts (such as company name structure, shareholder age, number of employees and taxpayer's payment behavior / morale). ).
Bavaria has introduced a rules-based RMS that allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as risk managers) to program their own rules for identifying potential tax fraudsters.
This RMS is applied at the moment when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT return.
The competent tax office will therefore receive a recommendation drawn up by the RMS before VAT is assessed.
As this RMS is not able to reflect current findings in its activities, risk managers must adjust the relevant rules based on the feedback from the tax authorities.
The Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania administrative district has programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with data from tax files in which the inspection revealed tax evasion.
Based on these data, RMS is able to determine the characteristics of tax evasion.
Once a month, RMS creates a list of tax files that are suspected of tax evasion.
The relevant tax authorities use this list as a basis for deciding on the audit of proposed taxpayers.
Following the audit, auditors must report their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.
The North Rhine-Westphalia administrative region uses an adaptive artificial neural network, which is combined with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on the large amount of data under consideration of VAT returns and some other facts, this neural-fuzzy system or data-mining system calculates the probability that a certain taxpayer has committed tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of potential fraudsters.
Local tax authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers for control and report the control findings to the data processing center.
The implementation of one of these three RMSs in the other Länder is ongoing.
Given that none of these three RMSs is based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems to be useful in tackling tax fraud.
The question remains whether this system will lead to the expected results.
Comparison and evaluation
Although the specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and the BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three Länder of Germany, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.
EU Member States' tax authorities are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - is not proving to be a national problem, but rather a European one.
Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in several States.
An effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.
VAT losses caused by fraud in the EU do not have to affect the Member State of the fraud initiator.
Any Member State involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.
Therefore, there should be a European exchange and discussion on RMS.
Selected audit findings when verifying business transactions
As part of cooperation on the implementation of parallel audits, the SAO and the BRH examined the quality and use of information on selected business transactions that were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
Furthermore, both audit institutions jointly examined the implementation of several business transactions in which there were doubts about their implementation, respectively. inconsistencies in the way taxpayers from both countries reported these business transactions in their VAT returns, resp. SH.
At the request of the BRH, the SAO examined a total of 8 cases concerning business transactions carried out between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.
Furthermore, in 43 cases, the SAO examined the values ​​of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxpayers reported in their tax returns and SH, on the basis of BRH notifications.
At the request of the SAO, the BRH examined a total of 23 cases concerning business transactions carried out between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Important information was exchanged under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through official communication with the CLO.
Examination of selected cases revealed, among other things, that the different way of registration in the EU Member States leads to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the data in VIES, the Czech payer was to acquire in III. quarter of 2004 from a German payer of goods worth EUR 60,500.
As the Czech taxpayer reported the acquisition of goods only in the value corresponding to EUR 29,869, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to verify the value of the delivered goods.
In response to the ZOI delivered from Germany, the German side stated that in II. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German payer supplied goods to the Czech payer in the amount of EUR 27,381; quarter in the amount of EUR 31,997 and in IV. quarter of 2004 in the amount of EUR 10 276.
The reply further showed that the VAT ID of the German taxpayer was only valid from 28 September 2004, but in 2006 the German CLO retroactively issued a VAT ID certificate from 1 May 2004 following an additional application by the German taxpayer for a VAT ID certificate. .
The German payer repaired SH.
Based on this information, the Czech payer was acquiring the goods.
By asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer, on the basis of the tax administrator's investigation, filed additional VAT returns for individual tax periods in 2004, increasing the value of goods acquired from other Member States and claiming VAT deduction. acquisition of goods from other Member States.
However, from these additional VAT returns, the Czech tax administrator could not unambiguously determine whether they also included the values ​​of supplies from the above-mentioned German supplier.
Based on the SAO 's request, the BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, as he did not request a VAT ID during registration, he was only assigned an identification number for transactions within Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to assign a VAT ID retroactively, in this case a German tax official assigned the above VAT ID retroactively to the above German taxpayer on 1 May 2004.
The German CLO assigns a VAT ID retroactively, unless the German entrepreneur has caused a delay in allocation; for example, if the delay was caused by the CLO after the VAT ID payer's request.
In this case, the CLO assigns the VAT ID retroactively because the trader does not need his own valid VAT ID for intra-Community supplies under § 6 of the German VAT Act.
Conversely, a German recipient does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier in order to declare an intra-Community acquisition.
Due to these different procedures between Member States, the German CLO retroactively assigned a VAT ID in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested verification of the German VAT payer's registration.
VIES indicated the date of registration on 5 March 2005, while the confirmation of registration of the German payer issued by the locally competent German tax office indicated the date on 1 October 2004.
In a reply received from Germany, the German side stated that the German tax entity had been registered since 1 October 2004, but that the VAT ID had not been provided to it in Germany for organizational reasons until 16 February 2005.
By asking the locally competent tax administrator, the SAO found out that the Czech tax administrator had performed a VAT inspection of the Czech taxpayer for tax period III. quarter 2004 to II. quarter of 2005.
Through this inspection, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer included in the VAT return services in the amount of CZK 9,897 (EUR 314) provided to the German taxpayer in the period before his registration for VAT (ie before 1 October 2004).
For the tax period III. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the tax office assessed VAT to the tax subject in the amount of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).
Based on the SAO's request, the BRH found out that the German taxpayer was assigned a VAT ID only on 16 February 2005, when he informed the tax office about his business, which he started in 2004.
In addition, the tax office registered it for VAT retrospectively on 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.
In this tax return, the taxpayer reported an intra-Community acquisition from the Czech Republic in the amount of EUR 160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. The Czech taxpayer reported in the tax return for VAT for September 2004 and SH for III. quarter of 2004 delivery of goods worth CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to a German payer.
During the verification of the registration of the German payer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found out that his registration was valid from 11 November 2004, ie only after the delivery of the goods by the Czech payer to Germany.
The Czech taxpayer submitted an additional DAP to VAT, in which he reported the tax base from domestic transactions in the amount of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and VAT in the amount of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692), which he paid.
Inquiring with the locally competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the SAO found out that the Czech taxpayer had subsequently filed a request for reopening of proceedings concerning an additional VAT return and submitted as evidence a confirmation from the German tax administration stating that the German taxpayer had been taxed since 1 January. 2000.
Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the German taxpayer's registration within the international exchange of information.
The reply received from Germany showed that the German taxpayer was assigned a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004, ie after the date of delivery of the goods.
For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the application for reopening of the proceedings.
The BRH found that in this case it was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods, because the German taxpayer did not obtain a VAT ID until 11.11.2004.
However, the German recipient recognized the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and reported VAT on that acquisition when it claimed a refund of input tax of the same amount.
However, as there would be no change in the value of the VAT which the German taxpayer was required to pay, the German tax authorities did not correct the information in his VAT return.
The BRH also found that the name of the German taxpayer, mentioned in the ŽOI, was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, as a result of which two German tax entities were confused.
This change in the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax administrator.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator verified the acquisition of goods by a Czech taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005 in the amount of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer.
By asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found out that this administrator had conducted a local investigation with the Czech taxpayer, verifying that the delivery of goods had taken place and that the Czech taxpayer had invoiced and paid the invoice for the goods in question.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of goods in the VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found out that the German taxpayer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only on 21 April 2005, ie only after the delivery to the Czech taxpayer.
At the same time, the Czech tax administrator asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the German taxpayer's registration certificate so that, if necessary, he could take steps to assess the tax.
The Czech Tax Office assessed the given business transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-payer from Germany, and therefore did not additionally assess the tax on the Czech payer from the said business transaction.
The BRH found that, under German law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order for the intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.
The supplier only needs to have the VAT ID of the acquirer from another Member State and must be able to prove the transport of the goods to another Member State.
According to the German VAT Act, it was therefore an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be assessed in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax administrator noticed this transaction, as the supply of the machine at that value was not the basic object of the German supplier's business.
As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to respond to R & D & I which concern intra - Community transactions of less than EUR 15 000:.
According to VIES data in III. quarter of 2004 to purchase goods worth EUR 12,561 from a German payer.
The Czech tax administrator performed a tax audit of the tax subject for this tax period.
As part of international administrative cooperation, he requested the German tax authorities to verify the supply of those goods using the SCAC form.
The Czech payer denied the acquisition of the goods, claiming that he had never traded with the German company and that the acquisition of the goods had not been accounted for in his accounts.
The German tax authorities rejected the request for the provision of evidence - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, on the grounds that the turnover did not exceed EUR 15 000 and no further explanatory justification was provided.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence for the additional assessment of the tax on the acquired goods, he terminated the tax audit without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed in the original amount.
Based on the SAO's request, the BRH found that the German payer acted as a so-called "fiscal representative" (§ 22 a - e UStG).
The German taxpayer declared those supplies in his annual VAT return and in SH.
He was granted the right to exemption from delivery.
Based on the BRH's notification, the German tax office will send to the Czech Republic the documents necessary for the additional assessment of the tax on the acquired goods in the Czech Republic.
As mentioned in Chapter 4.6.1, responses to the ZOI sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the set three - month deadline more often than responses from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.
The SAO found that the Czech Tax Administration sent a request for information to Germany on 5 October 2005 concerning the verification of the value of the goods supplied in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The German taxpayer reported in SH for this period the supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the amount of EUR 86,307, but the Czech taxpayer stated in the same period in the VAT return the acquisition of goods only in the value corresponding to EUR 35,314.
In its reply to the ZOI, delivered to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, ie after the expiry of the deadline for processing set out in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request could not be processed because German company was terminated at the end of 2005.
Due to the fact that the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for the settlement of the ZOI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, by means of an SCAC form, an inspection of the supply of cars in the amount of EUR 1,265,554 to a German taxpayer, which took place in III. and IV. quarter of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
The SAO found that no reply to the SOI had been received from Germany until the time of the inspection.
The SAO also found out by asking the locally competent tax administrator that the Czech taxpayer did not include in the VAT return the supply of new means of transport for the said German taxpayer in the amount of CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375,472).
The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity submitted a subsequent SH.
Based on the SAO's request, the BRH found that, for technical reasons, the German CLO had not handed over the above-mentioned ŽOI to the locally competent tax office for verification.
Following the notification of the BRH, an inspection was carried out in Germany at the German acquirer, during which it was found that the acquisition of all cars was properly taxed and that the cars in question were sold to another payer in Germany.
8. According to the data from VIES, the Czech payer was to acquire in IV. quarter of 2004 from a German payer a passenger car worth EUR 48,500.
The Czech payer did not admit the acquisition of these goods.
By inquiring with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found out that the Czech taxpayer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.
The tax returns were not filed by the Czech taxpayer even after the summons of the tax administrator, therefore on 23 May 2005 the tax office assessed him with VAT in the amount of CZK 0 for the period from October to December 2004.
On 2 June 2005, CLO drew attention to the above-mentioned delivery from a German payer.
As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator sent the ŽOI to Germany concerning the above-mentioned delivery.
As the reply to the ZOI was not delivered to the Czech Republic until 7 February 2007, it was not known until the end of the SAO's inspection how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by the international exchange.
As of 23 August 2005, the Tax Office canceled the VAT registration of the Czech taxpayer due to non-fulfillment of obligations arising from the VAT Act.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent to the ŽOI, because the control performed by the tax authorities at the payers was not completed at the time of the SAO and BRH inspection:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, via the SCAC form, to verify the delivery of a car worth EUR 16,991 to a German taxpayer, which took place in III. quarter of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
In its reply to the ŽOI, the German tax administrator stated that it had only an invoice issued by the Czech taxpayer for delivery in the amount of EUR 16,335.
Based on the SAO's request, the BRH found that the inspection carried out by the German tax office at the German acquirer had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer reported the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice in the tax returns for August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, by means of an SCAC form, an inspection of the supply of cars to a German taxpayer in the amount of EUR 198,167, carried out in IV. quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the ZOI to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed the acquisition of some cars by a German payer and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
The SAO found that the locally competent tax office carried out several local investigations at the Czech supplier in order to verify the drawing of excessive VAT deductions, during which it did not find any unauthorized drawing.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared goods from other Member States worth a total of EUR 579,114 in his VAT returns during that period and that the German tax office's inspection of the German purchaser had not yet been completed.
Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the values ​​of the intra-Community acquisition of goods, which the recipient stated in the tax return and the values, which the supplier stated in his SH.
The audited cases showed that the most common reasons for the differences were not a time shift or an indication of the incorrect value of the intra-Community supply of goods in SH:
11.
According to data from the VIES system, the Czech payer was to acquire goods worth EUR 35,716 from the German payer in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.
As the Czech taxpayer did not co-operate with the tax administrator and did not carry out any activities at the company's registered office, the Czech tax administrator requested to verify in the international exchange of information how the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.
The reply to the ŽOI received from Germany showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity is unknown at the communicated address and that the goods were taken over by the agreed carrier.
The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer only delivered goods worth EUR 21 659.
The Czech payer sent a false confirmation to the German payer about the payment of EUR 155,153 in favor of the German payer.
After finding fraud by the Czech acquirer, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7,916.
Inquiring with the locally competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the tax administrator, on the basis of information obtained, assessed the Czech VAT payer for the acquisition of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).
Based on the SAO's request, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier reported the delivery of goods to the Czech payer after repairs only in the amount of EUR 7,916.
According to the German legal situation, the German taxpayer reported the adjusted values ​​of the goods and the reduction in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the correction took place.
Thus, his SH contained the following delivery values ​​in relation to the Czech payer:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested, using the SCAC form, to verify the supply of goods and services effected in III. quarter of 2005.
According to this ŽOI, in this period the Czech payer was to deliver goods to the German payer in the total value of EUR 396,126 and provide services in the amount of EUR 11,885.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator had carried out a local investigation with the Czech taxpayer in order to verify this supply.
In response to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxpayer with a production line, including assembly.
The individual parts of the production line were delivered by the Czech payer before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, and after 1 May 2004, the line was assembled on the basis of an order.
The German payer did not take over the assembled line because he claimed to have defects.
And III. In the first quarter of 2005, the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for EUR 107,100 for assembly and EUR 11,885 for services.
The German payer took over the issued invoices, but did not acknowledge them and did not pay them.
The SAO also found out by asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic that all invoices were duly registered in the Czech taxpayer's accounts.
In tax returns for VAT for III. In the quarter of 2005, only the amounts that were documented by the Czech payer and that relate to invoicing after 1 May 2004 are listed.
BRH found that, based on a response from the Czech tax administration, the locally competent tax office in Germany came to the conclusion that the transaction involved the delivery of goods from a Czech taxpayer to a German taxpayer, including assembly services.
In this special case, the place of so-called performance of work is where the production line was assembled.
According to the German VAT law, the German recipient of the supplied service is obliged to pay VAT.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a VAT deduction from the same amount.
As there would be no change in the value of the VAT which the German taxpayer was required to pay, the corrections in the VAT return were neglected by the German tax authorities.
13. According to data from VIES, the Czech payer A was to purchase a machine worth EUR 58 000 from the German payer C in February 2005.
The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to verify this supply.
In its reply to the ŽOI, the German side stated that already in 2004 the German payer C delivered this machine to the Czech payer B, who, however, was to return this machine to the German payer C in October 2004.
According to the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but transported to the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, the reply to the request for information showed that in February 2005 the German payer C sold the machine to the Czech payer A.
This payer took over the machine at the seat of the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.
As the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intra-community delivery of goods.
By asking the tax administrator of the locally competent payer B, the SAO found that, according to VIES data, the German payer C had supplied in III. quarter of 2004 to the Czech payer B goods (another machine) in the amount of 88,027 EUR.
Payer B denied this acquisition of goods, so the locally competent tax administrator from the Czech Republic sent the ZOI to Germany.
According to the reply to this request, the machine was delivered.
By further investigation of payer B, the Czech tax administrator found that the machine worth EUR 88 027 was not in payer B 's accounts and that it could be a machine of the same type as that supplied by Czech payer C to Czech payer A in February 2005.
The SAO also found that the Czech tax administrator locally responsible for payer A carried out a local investigation at this payer.
The tax administrator had at his disposal the invoice of the German payer C dated 7 February 2005, on which the payer A was listed as the customer of the machine.
The Czech tax administrator found that payer A did not have this invoice included in the accounts.
Payer A had a leasing contract with another Czech company, where the subject of the lease was a machine of the same type.
The machine was handed over from the leasing company on February 9, 2005, and the machine was transported by the leasing company.
The Czech tax office did not use the information contained in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of payer A.
BRH found out that the German payer C did not deliver the machine worth EUR 88,027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.
It was therefore not an intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable supply in Germany.
For these reasons, the German tax administrator did not recognize the VAT exemption for German taxpayer C and corrected the data in his tax return.
German payer D delivered the machine to Czech payer B.
According to German law, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, BRH found that the German payer C stated in its SH for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth EUR 58,000 to the Czech payer A.
This supply was not verified during the tax audit carried out by the German tax office.
The following diagram shows the relationships between the participants in the above business transactions.
14.
During the audit of received ŽOI, the SAO found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech Tax Administration received a request for information from Germany, in which the German tax administrator requested verification of an intra-Community supply from a German taxpayer in the amount of EUR 879,680,625 to the Czech taxpayer.
According to the German tax authorities, there was a suspicion that this was a sham intra-Community supply of goods.
The ŽOI further stated that the German payer had not carried out any active business activity since 1999.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator had conducted a local investigation with the Czech taxpayer.
According to the executive of the Czech company, in the above case it was probably a claim of a German taxpayer against the German tax administration, which was filed by the Czech taxpayer as a partner of a German company with the German tax office.
According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administrator does not yet have any information that the German tax administration would address the issue relating to the Czech taxpayer.
According to the available information, it was not a supply of goods, nevertheless the stated value is still included in the VIES system as an intra-Community supply of goods to a Czech payer from Germany.
The main reason for the following discrepancies was that the beneficiaries did not report intra-Community acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also Chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to data from VIES, the German payer in III. quarter to 2004 to the first quarter of 2005 to a Czech payer of goods with a total value of EUR 33,205. The Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.
THIS segment IS intentionally LEFT blank
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested verification of the delivery of goods from Germany.
In response to this request, the German tax administration stated that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer, the Czech taxpayer had collected the remaining goods in person.
By inquiring with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found out that even before receiving the reply to the ŽOI, the Czech taxpayer submitted additional VAT returns for the specified periods.
Despite this submission, the differences in the acquisition values ​​were not resolved, therefore the Czech tax administrator recommended to perform a tax audit of the Czech taxpayer.
The inspection has not yet been performed.
16. According to the data in VIES in III. quarter of 2004 to a Czech payer of goods worth EUR 46,854.
For the same period, the Czech payer granted intra-Community acquisitions only in the amount corresponding to EUR 14,856.
The Czech tax administrator requested verification of the value of the supplies made within the framework of the international exchange of information.
The reply to the ŽOI, delivered from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of the delivery of goods of EUR 31,999, ie the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the data in the VIES system.
By asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that after receiving a reply from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the Czech taxpayer's accountant and agreed with him that he would discuss filing an additional VAT return for III. quarter of 2004.
An additional VAT return has not yet been filed.
The Czech tax administrator informed the SAO that he would proceed in such a way as to comply with the set deadlines for any additional assessment of VAT for the relevant tax period.
17.
The German payer had in IV. quarter of 2004 to deliver to the Czech payer goods worth EUR 11,600.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested confirmation of whether the Czech taxpayer actually existed, as the alleged partner of the German taxpayer had set up several fictitious companies in Germany.
During the verification of the business transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of the goods to the tax office.
According to the Czech payer, however, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were resold during 2005 in Germany.
The Czech payer submitted documents on the sale of goods for January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered in Germany as a VAT payer, he did not declare or pay tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts indicated tax evasion in Germany and the Czech tax administrator informed them to the German tax administration in response to the ZOI.
By asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer, on the basis of the investigations carried out, submitted an additional tax return for VAT for IV. quarter of 2004, in which he included the value of the acquisition of goods from, inter alia, a German taxpayer and at the same time claimed the right to deduct tax on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.
He did not state VAT from the sale of goods in Germany in the Czech VAT return.
The Czech tax administrator assessed the additional VAT return after the local investigation without change.
According to the Czech legislation, in this case it was not the acquisition of goods from other Member States, because the goods were not sent or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administrator therefore made an incorrect conclusion to the local investigation.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the ŽOI, which stated that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax administrator corrected the German taxpayer's tax return and demanded VAT of EUR 1,600 from him.
In addition, the competent tax office has sent a notification to the tax office of the actual consignee to ensure that the resale of the goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, payers reported intra-Community transactions that may not have actually taken place:
18.
The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
Attached to the application was a copy of the certificate of registration of the Czech VAT payer.
A copy of the passport of the person who, as has been said, was to transport the car was also attached.
During the investigation, the Czech tax administrator found out that the passport was stolen, the person listed in it did not import any vehicle into the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax entity.
The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German side, was never issued by the Czech tax administrator.
This information was included by the Czech tax administrator in the reply to the ŽOI together with the statement that he could not confirm the acquisition of the goods - the car in question.
The SAO, inquired with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found out that the Czech taxpayer was not domiciled at the address specified in the Commercial Register and that the company's executive officer was non-contact.
Following the reprimand proceedings for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax administrator imposed a tax liability of CZK 0 on the Czech taxpayer.
Further investigation by the Czech tax administrator found that the car in question had been sold to another Czech entity, which bought it through an advertisement on the Internet.
The BRH found that the locally competent German tax administrator, on the basis of the Czech reply to the ŽOI, would not recognize the German taxpayer's right to exemption from this supply from VAT.
19. During the audit, the German tax office was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3000 between the value of the acquired goods reported in the taxpayer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.
It was stated that the Czech payer was to deliver during the IV. quarter to 2004 to the first quarter of 2005 to a German payer of goods worth EUR 89,424.
As the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested verification of the supplies and their payment in the framework of the international exchange of information.
In response to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the sole executive officer of the Czech company had been deleted from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and the new executive officer had not been registered.
The German consignee of the goods appeared to be a relative of a partner in Czech society.
The Czech taxpayer filed tax returns for VAT and SH, which was signed by an unauthorized person - the said partner of the company - after deleting the executive officer from the Commercial Register.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer confirmed to the tax administrator that the company's partner deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
The SAO in the Czech Republic, by asking the locally competent tax office, found out that the tax administrator recognized the Czech taxpayer as IV. In the first quarter of 2004, entitlement to exemption from VAT on the supply of goods to another Member State in the amount of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) and in the first quarter of 2005 in the amount of CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548).
The BRH found that the German tax administrator had not corrected the German acquirer's VAT return because a German judge had in the meantime confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
As the previous audit did not reveal any signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to enforce the assessed tax liability.
20. According to data in VIES, a German payer purchased goods worth EUR 4,251,196 from the Czech Republic in 2005, after purchasing goods worth EUR 43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not report an intra-Community acquisition in the 2004 tax return or in the 2005 tax return.
In addition, it did not show adequate supplies.
Due to these differences, the German tax office sent the ŽOI for the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In these two quarters, the Czech supplier reported in SH an intra-Community supply of goods to a German payer in the total amount of CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).
On 6 September 2006, the ŽOI was delivered, in which the German side requested to check whether the intra-Community supplies declared by the Czech payer had taken place.
In response to this ŽOI, the Czech Tax Administration stated that it was not possible to comply with the German party's request because the Czech taxpayer had no executive.
As follows from the materials provided by the SAO by the relevant tax administrator, on 30 March 2006 a protocol was drawn up with the executive of the Czech taxpayer on the commencement of the VAT audit for IV. quarter of 2004 and January to December 2005.
The taxpayer was also invited by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the above periods, but did not submit any documents.
According to the Commercial Register, the sole executive officer of the Czech payer ceased to hold office on 16 May 2006, and no new executive officer was appointed.
As of April 2006, the Czech taxpayer has stopped filing VAT returns.
As part of its audit, the SAO, in cooperation with the BRH, examined, among other things, several cases of intra-Community supplies made between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of both countries.
Information on the cases examined was exchanged between the two SAIs through the CLOs of both countries.
21. A Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany has informed the relevant tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out a taxable transaction in Germany.
Due to this information, the company has been registered since June 2005, but has not received a German VAT ID.
(ECR) received an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind turbines and for the supply of these wind turbines in the name, at the risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.
Due to the lack of its own capacities, the Czech company handed over part of the order to a German payer (eD), who is based in Germany.
The following diagram shows the contractual relations and the method of transporting wind turbines:
According to the German legal situation, the place of implementation of these transactions must be determined according to the following:
- A Danish businessman (eDK) sent wind farms for assembly under his own name, at his own risk and on his own account to Austria.
As the installation of this supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind turbines is taxable in Austria.
- As the carrier was instructed by a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his own risk and at his own expense, the delivery by a German subcontractor (eDK) took place where the transport began - in Germany.
Although the wind farms were sent to another Member State and the recipient is a registered payer from another Member State, the German subcontractor (eD) could not obtain an exemption because another Member State of destination is different from another Member State of the Czech company's registered office.
This supply is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted input tax in its tax returns.
The place of delivery to the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of the transport.
The transportation of some wind power plants was started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.
- The delivery of those wind power plants that are manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- Delivery of other wind turbines, which are manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.
So the Czech company (eCR) made both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not report any intra - Community acquisitions in its VAT return in Germany, nor did it submit SH to the German CLO.
So it is possible that the Czech company reported all intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The SAO found that (eCR) did not report any intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-community deliveries to Denmark.
An examination of the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although this case shows no signs of tax fraud or evasion.
Furthermore, the SAO and the BRH examined the transactions in order to point out the differences between the tax return and the data from the VIES system, which were caused by different VAT legislation in 2004.
The audited cases also demonstrate that changes in legislation need time for both new and tax authorities to put new legislation into practice:
22. In SH for II. to IV. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech payer reported an intra-Community delivery to a German payer in the total amount of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).
During the same period, another Czech payer in SH reported an intra-Community delivery to another German payer in the total amount of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).
According to the information provided by the SAO from the BRH, in both cases it was the supply of electricity.
Both Czech payers listed the above deliveries in the SH in accordance with the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., In force in 2004.
Further examination of the above transactions, the group of auditing SAOs found that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and Germany in the legal regulation of deliveries, resp. acquisition of electricity.
While in the Czech Republic the payers reported the supply of electricity in accordance with the valid wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as an intra-community supply of goods, from the point of view of the German legislation in force in 2004, it was not an intra-community acquisition, but a taxable supply with the place of supply in Germany.
The difference in legal regulations in the Czech Republic was eliminated by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll., Which amends certain acts in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1 January 2005.
23. In examining selected intra-Community transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was further found that the Czech payer reported in SH for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2005 an intra-Community supply to a German payer in the total value of CZK 240,411,163 (EUR 8,071,823) and another Czech payer. reported in SH for the same period an intra-Community supply to a German payer in the total amount of CZK 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050).
According to the information provided by the SAO from the BRH, in both cases it was a supply of electricity.
According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., Effective from 1 January 2005, in the case of electricity supply, the place of performance is the place where the acquirer has its registered office, place of business or where it has an establishment for which these goods are delivered.
Therefore, in 2005, Czech payers should not indicate the supply of electricity to SH.
As the two above-mentioned payers reported an intra-Community supply of electricity in SH, the data in VIES were distorted by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).
Conclusion
The cooperation met the objectives of the BRH and the SAO.
Both SAIs have gained a deeper knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed the differences between the two systems and showed that the legislation in the field of VAT administration differs.
During parallel inspections, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were identified.
It makes sense to check some of them later.
Based on the audit findings, both SAIs made recommendations regarding VAT administration.
Follow-up to these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.
New experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both control institutions are the basis for the successful implementation of the following controls of the VAT administration.

Report on the Results of International Cooperation in Excise Tax Administration Controls between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006
Foreword
The presented joint report informs about the course and result of international cooperation in parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, focused on the administration of excise duties in the period after both countries join the European Union.
The co - operation was carried out on the basis of an agreement on co - operation in control activities, concluded in February 2006.
The topic of parallel controls was chosen with regard to the fundamental change in the system of collection of excise duties, which occurred in connection with the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union on 1 May 2004.
The functioning of the European Union's internal market requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.
The basic principle is to allow the circulation of tax-free goods until the day of their delivery for final consumption.
In accordance with that principle, the new legislation adopted in both countries allows for the movement of goods under fiscal supervision under a duty suspension arrangement.
The system places great demands on tax administrations and presupposes close cooperation between the competent administrative authorities of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud in this area.
Report on the outcome of international cooperation in controls on the administration of excise duties for the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.
Introduction
Inspection number: (CZ) 05/34 (SR) 48/11
Subject of control: (Czech Republic) Administration of excise duties (Slovak Republic) Procedure of customs authorities in the administration of excise duties
On 8 February 2006, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “SAO-CR”) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “SAO SR”) concluded an “Agreement on Cooperation in Audit Activities”.
The subject of the agreement was cooperation in parallel inspections "Excise Tax Administration", included in the SAO-CR inspection plan for 2005 under No. 05/34, and "Control of the procedure of customs authorities in excise administration", included in the SAO inspection plan SR for the year 2006 under No. 48/11.
Parallel inspections were in the nature of coordinated inspections.
The co-operation consisted in exchanging information which the contracting parties could not obtain during the control of excise administration in their territory and in preparing a joint final report on the result of controls in accordance with European implementing directives for the implementation of INTOSAI auditing standards - Directive 31.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, inspections (hereinafter referred to as the “Czech Republic”) were carried out by groups of inspectors from the state budget department and territorial departments of Central Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Western Bohemia, Northwestern Bohemia, Northeastern Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia. February to 2 June 2006.
27 inspectors were involved in the inspection.
The auditees were the General Directorate of Customs ("GDC") and 11 tax offices.
Within the GDC, 12 selected customs offices out of the total number of 54 were inspected.
The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “SR”) was carried out by the Finance and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice branches at 5 customs offices out of a total of 9 in the period from 13 February to 2 June 2006.
8 inspectors were involved in the inspection.
The aim of the parallel controls was to examine the customs authorities' practice in administering excise duties and compliance with the relevant legislation in force in both countries and in the European Union.
International cooperation focused on the procedure of tax administrators in supervising the transport of excisable goods, especially on the registration of started and terminated transport in the regime of conditional tax exemption, and on the exchange of information within mutual administrative assistance between excise tax administrators of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
2. Administration of excise duties
Until 31 December 2003, the administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic was performed by financial authorities.
From 1 January 2004, this agenda was taken over by the customs authorities, which until now collected excise duty only on imports.
Mineral oils, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products are subject to excise duty in the Czech Republic.
The state budget revenue from excise duties in the Czech Republic totaled CZK 82.8 billion in 2004, and excise duties accounted for 19.5% of state budget revenue from taxes and fees of CZK 424.7 billion.
In 2005, state budget revenues from excise duties amounted to CZK 103.6 billion and the share of state budget revenues from taxes and fees in the amount of CZK 460.4 billion was 22.5%.
In 2004, the revenue from the excise duty on mineral oils to the state budget amounted to 80% of the total revenue from this tax and in 2005 it was 90.9%.
The difference compared to 100% of CZK 13 billion in 2004 and CZK 6.9 billion in 2005 was the revenue of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure.
The administration of all excise duties in the Slovak Republic has been performed by the customs authorities since 1 May 2004, with the exception of the excise duty on mineral oil, which they have been administering since 1 January 2002.
Until then, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the tax authorities.
Mineral oil, alcohol, beer, wine and tobacco products are subject to excise duty in the Slovak Republic.
The state budget revenue from excise duties in the Slovak Republic in 2004 totaled Sk 43.4 billion, and excise duties accounted for 20.7% of total tax revenues of Sk 209.5 billion.
In 2005, state budget revenue from excise duties was Sk 50 billion, and excise duties accounted for 22.5% of total tax revenues of Sk 222.6 billion.

Legislation in both countries is based on European Union legislation in this area, in particular: - Council Directive 92/12 / EEC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (hereinafter "Directive 92/12 / EEC") ), - Council Regulation (EC) No 2073/2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as 'Regulation No 2073/2004'), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92 on the official accompanying document for shipments - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3649/92 on the simplified accompanying document for the movement of excise goods which have been subject to excise duty suspension released for home use in the Member State of dispatch within the Community ('Regulation No 3649/92').
The basic legal regulation regulating the issue of excise duties in the Czech Republic is Act No. 353/2003 Coll., On excise duties, as amended, (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 353/2003 Coll.”), Effective from 1 January 2004.
When administering excise duties in the Slovak Republic, the customs authorities are bound, inter alia, by the following generally binding legal regulations: - Act No. 98/2004 Coll., On excise duty on mineral oil, as amended (hereinafter “Act No. 98/2004 Coll. Act No. 104/2004 Coll., on excise duty on wine, as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 104/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 105/2004 On excise duty on alcohol, as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 105/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 106/2004 Coll., On excise duty on tobacco products, as amended regulations (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 106/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 107/2004 Coll., on excise duty on beer, as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 107/2004 Coll. of.").
2.1 Movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty between the Member States of the European Union
The conditions for the movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty are laid down in Directive 92/12 / EEC in Title III - Movement of goods, Articles 15 to 20.
Under those provisions, the transport of those goods may be carried out only by an authorized warehousekeeper, which is a natural or legal person authorized by the competent authorities of a Member State to manufacture, process, store, receive and dispatch excise goods.
The consignee in another Member State may be an authorized warehousekeeper or an economic operator without the status of authorized warehousekeeper, who, however, may not store or re-dispatch these products under the duty suspension arrangement.
Authorized warehousekeeper in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic means the operator of a tax warehouse, the economic entity is the authorized consignee for repeated or one-time acceptance of products subject to excise duty.
According to Directive 92/12 / EEC, the movement of products subject to excise duty under suspension of excise duty is possible only with an accompanying document.
The consignment note shall be issued by the consignor in four copies before the start of the shipment, unless another copy is requested by the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch.
2.2 Procedure for starting and ending the transport of goods in the regime of conditional tax exemption between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Transport from the Czech Republic
The procedure for starting transport is regulated by the provisions of Section 25, Paragraph 3 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll., Which states, inter alia:
'Before the transport of selected products begins, the operator of the tax warehouse shall inform the customs office which is locally competent for the tax warehouse from which the transport is to commence;
the transport of selected products can only be started with the consent of this customs office.
The customs office shall give its consent to the transport of the selected products immediately after the condition of securing the tax is met ... '
The consignor in the Czech Republic may start the transport of all types of products subject to excise duty only with the consent of the locally competent customs office.

Transport from Slovakia
Until 31 December 2005, the procedure for the transport of alcohol and tobacco products from the Slovak Republic to another Member State of the European Union was amended as follows:
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 26, Paragraph 4 of Act No. 105/2004 Coll.
'When transporting alcohol from a tax warehouse in a tax territory to a tax warehouse or to an authorized consignee or to a tax agent in another Member State, the consignor (supplier) shall send a copy of the first part of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the Poprad Customs Office on the day the transport begins; he shall also send this copy to the customs office in writing within five working days from the date of commencement of the shipment. "
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 22, Paragraph 4 of Act No. 106/2004 Coll.
'When transporting tobacco products from a tax warehouse in a tax territory to a tax warehouse or to an authorized consignee or tax agent in another Member State, the consignor ’(supplier’) shall send a copy of the first part of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the Poprad Customs Office on the day the transport begins; he shall also send this copy to the customs office in writing no later than five working days from the date of commencement of the shipment. "
When transporting other products subject to excise duty (mineral oil, wine and beer) in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the “audited period”), the tax entity was not obliged to notify the Poprad Customs Office, resp. the competent customs office of departure under the duty suspension arrangement.
The tax administrator learned about the transport of these products only during a local investigation or tax inspection from the accompanying documents and from the accounting documents of the tax subject.
Before starting the transport, the consignor in the Slovak Republic is obliged to prepare an accompanying document in four copies.
Copy No. 1 shall be kept by the consignor (when transporting alcohol and tobacco products, he shall send a copy of copy No. 1 electronically or by fax to the Poprad Customs Office and the relevant customs office).
Copies No. 2, 3 and 4 accompany the transported goods.
According to the Czech legislation, the recipient in the Czech Republic will keep copy No. 2 of the accompanying document issued by the sender in the Slovak Republic and will confirm the receipt of the products on copies No. 3 and 4.
Confirmed copies No. 3 and 4 shall be sent to the locally competent customs office in the Czech Republic no later than the first working day after the end of the transport.
The customs office shall retain copy No 4 and return copy No 3, on which it shall verify correctness and validity, to the consignee.
The consignee shall send the certified copy No. 3 no later than the next working day after its receipt to the sender to the Slovak Republic.
Transport in the Slovak Republic is considered to be completed on the day of receipt of the products by the consignee.
The sender proves the termination of the transport by submitting copy No. 3 of the accompanying document confirmed by the consignee and the tax administrator in the Czech Republic.
Graph No. 3 - Circulation of the accompanying document during transport (alcohol and tobacco products) started in the Slovak Republic and ended in the Czech Republic
In 2006, amendments to all laws on excise duties were gradually adopted in the Slovak Republic, according to which the consignor of goods under conditional tax exemption is obliged to send a copy of copy No. 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the locally competent consignor before commencing transport.
The document proving the termination of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products is copy No. 3 of the accompanying document confirmed by the recipient and his relevant tax administrator.
The document proving the termination of the transport of mineral oils, wine and beer is copy No. 3 confirmed by the recipient.
The confirmation of the tax administrator of another Member State of the receipt of the said goods by the consignee is required if this administrator is obliged under the legislation of the Member State concerned to certify copy No 3 of the accompanying document.
2.3 Records of started and terminated transports kept by customs authorities in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic
There is no single electronic system for monitoring the movement of goods under the duty suspension arrangement between the Member States of the European Union.
Decision 1152/2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products requires Member States and the European Commission to set up an electronic Excise Movement and Control System from 1 July 2009. ), which would allow excise administrators in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the movement of goods.
The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently used only in paper form, and will help to facilitate the movement of goods under suspension of excise duty and ensure more effective control of the movement of tax-free products within all Member States.
This system will include the national transport databases of the individual Member States.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic registers all transports started and terminated on the territory of the Czech Republic in the module of Records of Selected Products (hereinafter referred to as "EVV").
All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have online access to the system.
In the case of transport carried out only on the territory of the Czech Republic, the tax administrator may obtain information on the commencement or termination of the transport immediately after the registration of the accompanying document by the customs office in the EVV.
The customs office shall release the tax security for the transported products provided by the consignor at the moment of registration of the termination of the transport by the customs office to the locally competent consignee.
Customs offices in the Slovak Republic use a database based on the SysNed application software, which ensures the automation of their activities in the administration of excise duties and communication with European Union systems.
By registering the tax warehouse, the tax warehouse operator or the authorized recipient in the SysNed application software, this data is automatically transferred to the "System for Exchange of Excise Data" database (hereinafter referred to as "SEED").
3. Preparation and course of cooperation
The first coordination meeting of the SAO-CR representatives and the SAO SR representatives, at which a specific procedure of cooperation in the implementation of parallel controls in the field of excise duties was discussed, took place in January 2006.
Both parties became acquainted with the legislation in the field of excise duties and with the organization of the administration of excise duties in both countries.
Special attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the authorization, respectively. when initiating and terminating the movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty and the exchange of information between the excise administrators of the two countries.
At the meeting, it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak sides: - process overall data on the amount of excise goods transported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic and vice versa, whose transport began in the audited period, - compare data on mineral oil shipments - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and alcohol - code of the combined nomenclature 2207 and 2208 in the regime of conditional exemption from tax started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Slovak Republic and vice versa in the months of November 2004 and September 2005.
During the inspections, the audited periods were extended to October and November 2005, and in these months the transport of tobacco products under the conditional tax exemption regime was also subject to the inspection.
Tables No. 1 and No. 2 show the total quantity of products subject to excise duty that were transported under the conditional tax exemption regime between Czech and Slovak tax entities in the audited period.
4. Comparison of records of transport of goods in the regime of conditional exemption from tax
The SAO-CR handed over to the Slovak side a database of transports terminated in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5,876 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 5,738 items related to mineral oils, 134 items to alcohol and 4 items to tobacco products.
The SAO SR handed over to the Czech side a database of transports terminated in the Slovak Republic, which contained a total of 3,319 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 696 items related to mineral oil, 2,066 items of alcohol and 557 items of tobacco products.
The SAO-CR compared data on transports listed in the register of started transports in the Czech Republic with data on completed transports registered in the Slovak Republic.
The results of the comparison are shown in Table 3.
Data on transports in November 2004 and September 2005 were compared by the SAO-CR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which was handed over to it by the SAO SR at the beginning of the inspection.
The database did not contain data enabling reliable reconciliation of individual transports, and therefore only 63% of started transports were managed to be assigned.
Individual shipments were assigned according to multiple data, eg shipper, consignee, date of shipment, quantity of transported products.
Data on transports started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Slovak Republic in October and November 2005 were compared by the SAO-CR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which contained all data according to accompanying documents, on the basis of which 93% of started transports were clearly assigned.
In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the amount of mineral oils were given in liters or tonnes, depending on the type of mineral oil.
The quantity of alcohol was in most cases given in liters, which could, however, be converted into liters of absolute alcohol on the basis of the percentage alcohol content indicated in the database.
The quantity of tobacco products was stated in pieces, in thousands and in kilograms according to the type of tobacco products.
For transports started in the Czech Republic, the completion of which could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database or for which the data on the transported quantity of products did not match, the accompanying documents were checked.
Accompanying documents for 487 shipments of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were inspected.
The inspection of these documents was carried out at the customs offices at which the SAO-CR performed the inspection.
For transport authorized by other customs offices, the accompanying documents were requested through the GDC.
The Czech side requested the Slovak side to verify the implementation of 141 shipments for which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not provide certified copies No. 3 of the accompanying document, or the quantity of products stated on the accompanying document did not agree with the quantity of products listed in the database.
Furthermore, the Slovak side was provided with data on transports registered in the Slovak database, which, however, did not contain the transport database of the Czech customs administration.
The SAO SR searched for 95 transports in the database of the Slovak Customs Administration.
The verification of the remaining 46 shipments was requested by the locally competent customs offices, which proved their completion with copies of the accompanying documents.
The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side copies of the accompanying documents, on the basis of which the transports were also identified in the Czech database, with the exception of transports performed by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of started transports.
The inspection of these cases revealed:
- in the Slovak transport database, 11 transports of alcohol in the total amount of 276.7 liters of alcohol realized by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 transports of alcohol in the total amount of 404.66 liters of alcohol realized in 2005 were registered.
The SAO-CR found that these were transports of taxed products for the initiation of which the sender does not need the consent of the tax administrator.
The sender informed the tax administrator in writing about the start of the transport. He carried out the transport on the basis of accompanying documents, which are used for the transport of products under the conditional tax exemption regime;
- in the Slovak transport database, a total of 94 transports of mineral oils were registered, combined nomenclature code 2710 11 21, in the total volume of 173 thous. liters realized by the Czech tax entity in the period from September 2004 to December 2005.
The SAO-CR found that in the period from May 2004 to June 2005, the tax subject carried out a transport of 102 thous. liters of untaxed mineral oils without proper authorization.
The taxable person held a special permit for the receipt and use of exempt products, on the basis of which he could supply non-taxed products only to the holder of the same permit.
He did not notify the customs office in the Czech Republic of the commencement of transport and did not provide tax security in the amount of CZK 1,207,680 for the transported products.
In the period from July 2005 to December 2005, the tax subject transported 71 thous. liters of taxed mineral oils. Even in these cases, he failed to fulfill his legal obligation by notifying the customs office of the commencement of transport.
The consignor in the Czech Republic may start the transport of products released for free circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State without the consent of the customs office, but he is obliged to notify the customs office of this fact in writing before commencing transport.
A taxable person taking products released for free circulation in another Member State is obliged to declare the quantity and secure the tax before taking it.
Products may be transported only with a simplified accompanying document, the details of which are regulated by Regulation No 3649/92.
This Regulation also allows the use of an accompanying document for transport under a duty suspension arrangement, which must, however, clearly indicate that it is a "simplified accompanying document for tax control purposes (products subject to excise duty)".
The same legal regulation of transport and acceptance of products released for free tax circulation in another Member State also applies in the Slovak Republic.
In the above cases, the tax subjects transported the products released for free tax circulation with an accompanying document for transport in the regime of conditional exemption from tax, the 3rd and 4th copies of which the recipient submitted to the tax administrator in the Slovak Republic for verification.
The customs authorities in the Slovak Republic registered these transports in the database of transports in the regime of conditional exemption from tax, as it was not stated on the accompanying documents that it was a simplified accompanying document.
The SAO SR compared the transport database of the Czech customs administration with the transport database of the Slovak customs administration and found out:
- in the databases, the quantity of transported products was stated inconsistently, eg mineral oil was stated in liters, hectoliters or kilograms; the alcohol was expressed in liters or liters of alcohol, making it difficult to compare the quantities of goods transported,
- the quantity of alcohol transported indicated on the invoices did not correspond to the quantity recorded in the databases,
- the databases did not list all the related invoices,
- in the database of the Slovak customs administration, two shipments of alcohol from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic were registered in November 2004 in the total volume of 47,237 liters of alcohol, which were not in the database of the Czech customs administration.
The Slovak side submitted copies of accompanying documents to the Czech side.
5. International exchange of information between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Until 30 June 2005, the conditions for cooperation between the administrations of the Member States responsible for administering excise duties were governed by Council Directive 77/799 / EEC on mutual assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxes on insurance premiums.
On 1 July 2005, Regulation No 2073/2004 entered into force, which lays down rules and procedures enabling the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange the information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties.
Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office to liaise with the other Member States in the field of excise administration and to be responsible for exchanging information on the movement of excise goods.
In the Czech Republic, the "Excise Liaison Office" (hereinafter referred to as the "ELO CR") was established at the GDC to ensure the exchange of information in the field of excise duties between the Member States of the European Union.
With effect from 1 May 2004, the ELO Office at the Poprad Customs Office provided tasks related to the administration of systems for controlling the movement of excisable goods (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of information within mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the Slovak Republic.
With effect from 1 July 2005, the tasks of the ELO Office are performed by the ELO Department (based in Poprad) of the Excise Tax Department of the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "ELO SR").
Pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Regulation No 2073/2004, the central liaison office is responsible in particular for: - the exchange of data held in the SEED electronic register, - the 'Early Warning System Excise' (EWSE), - requests for verification movement of excise goods sent to or received from other Member States by the "Movement Verification System" (hereinafter referred to as "MSS").
The content, scope and functions of the SEED, EWSE and MVS systems are regulated in Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation 2073/2004.
SEED - a system for the exchange of information on taxable persons trading in excise goods.
The system is made up of national registers of excise duty payers and allows tax administrations in the European Union to find out whether products subject to excise duty are traded by an authorized person.
Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States for excise purposes only.
The central liaison office of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union can obtain confirmation of the information held in this database.
In accordance with Section 41 of Act No. 98/2004 Coll., With Section 39 of Act No. 104/2004 Coll., With Section 46 of Act No. 105/2004 Coll., With Section 40 of Act No. 106/2004 Coll., Section 39 of Act No. 107/2004 Coll., ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of operators of tax warehouses, authorized recipients and tax warehouses - the SEED database.
Customs offices in the Slovak Republic contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, a tax warehouse operator or an authorized consignee in the SysNed application software, which is automatically connected to ELO SR.
For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, authorized beneficiary or tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, the related data is automatically transferred to the SEED database.
The SAO SR found that the exchange of SEED databases between the Customs Administration of the SR and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place in the audited period usually once a month, exceptionally several times a month.
The Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.
The data are transferred to the SEED database in the Czech Republic from the national register, in which all persons authorized to dispose of products subject to excise duty and issued authorizations to dispose of these products are registered.
Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international SEED database.
Requests from customs offices for the provision of information from the SEED database of other member countries are obtained only through the ELO CR.
EWSE - an early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excisable goods, through which the transport of risky consignments is notified.
The transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits set by a regulation of the European Commission and the transport assessed as risky by the tax administrator are considered risky consignments.
The exchange of information is realized in two forms:
- information - sent when the set limits are exceeded,
- warning message - sent if the transport of goods is assessed as risky.
When evaluating the degree of risk of a consignment, ELO SR uses the SEED database to send a warning message, on the basis of which it checks the data stated in the accompanying document.
In the event that the data in the SEED database do not match the data in the accompanying document (for example, the registration number of the consignee does not match or the consignee's registered office), ELO SR will prepare a warning message to send to the ELO.
When drawing up the reports, ELO follows the regulations of the Commission for Taxation and Customs, CED 317 and CED 457, which determine, inter alia, the type and quantity of goods in the relevant units of measurement for drawing up information and warning reports.
During the audited period, ELO SR sent one warning message to ELO CR.
In the Czech Republic, information on started shipments of products in quantities exceeding the set limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when approving the shipment.
If the tax administrator in the Czech Republic evaluates the consignment as risky on the basis of its own analysis, it will prepare a so-called warning message, which it will send to the relevant Member State via the ELO CR.
In 2005, ELO CR sent two warning messages to ELO SR.
MVS - the system of control of the movement of goods - enables, through MVS applications, to control individual shipments of products subject to excise duty as well as control of the determined route of transport between the entities listed in the accompanying document.
The exchange of information takes place on the basis of a request in which the ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.
The system is used mainly in cases where the sender receives a certified copy No. 3 of the accompanying document and requests, for example, a refund of excise duty, and in cases where the data contained in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.
In the audited period, ELO SR sent 33 requests to the ELO CR.
ELO CR sent ELO SR 25 MVS applications.
The customs offices in the Czech Republic most often checked the data stated in the accompanying documents, especially the amount received, resp. of the products dispatched or whether the consignor of the products listed in the accompanying document is authorized to handle the excise goods, if this could not be verified in the international SEED database.
In both countries, the applications received by the RAC were forwarded to the customs offices locally responsible for the consignee or consignor of the excise goods.
The customs authorities checked the required data and communicated the result of the investigation to the other Member State via ELO.
6. Summary
The cooperation between the SAO-CR and the SAO SR made it possible to compare the basic legal regulations governing excise duties in both countries, the procedure of the Czech and Slovak customs authorities to start and stop the transport of products under conditional tax exemption between the two countries, records of these transports and between customs authorities in the framework of international cooperation.
6.1 A comparison of legal regulations governing the area of ​​excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic revealed differences:
(a) in the procedure of taxable persons and tax administrations when initiating the transport of products under a duty suspension arrangement.
The tax subject in the Czech Republic may start the transport of products under the conditional tax exemption regime only with the consent of the tax administrator, who will allow the start of transport provided that the transported products have been provided with a tax security in the amount of tax due to them.
The commencement of the transport of products under the conditional tax exemption regime in the Slovak Republic is not subject to the permission of the tax administrator.
During the audited period, the tax entity was obliged to notify the tax administrator of the commencement of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products.
He could start transporting mineral oils, beer and wine without informing the tax administrator.
In 2006, amendments to all laws on excise duties were gradually adopted in the Slovak Republic, according to which the consignor of goods under conditional tax exemption is obliged to send a copy of copy No. 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office locally competent for the consignor;
(b) within the time limits for sending copy No 3 of the accompanying document.
The consignee in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copy No. 3 and 4 of the accompanying document to the tax administrator for verification no later than the next working day after the end of the transport.
He is obliged to send the certified copy No. 3 to the sender no later than the next working day after receiving it from the tax administrator.
The consignee in the Slovak Republic is obliged to send the sender of the products a copy No. 3 confirmed by the tax administrator and the consignee of the products no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.
6.2. Customs authorities in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic keep electronic records of transports of products in the regime of conditional tax exemption.
The content and manner of keeping these records is not regulated by law in the Czech Republic or in the Slovak Republic.
The customs authorities in both countries enter in the register all data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport is carried out.
There is currently no single electronic system for monitoring the movement of goods under suspension of excise duty between the Member States of the European Union, which would allow excise administrators in the individual Member States to obtain information on the movement of goods in real time.
Decision 1152/2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 provides for the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excisable products from 1 July 2009.
Based on the agreement on cooperation in control activities, the Czech side handed over to the Slovak side a database of transports of products under the conditional tax exemption regime initiated in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.
The database contained 5,876 items related to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.
The Slovak side handed over to the Czech side a database of transports of products under the conditional tax exemption regime initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic.
The database contained 3,319 items related to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.
The Czech side compared the data on transports listed in the register of started transports in the Czech Republic with the records of transports completed in the Slovak Republic.
The Slovak side compared data on transports of goods under the conditional tax exemption regime initiated in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.
The comparison of data was complicated by the fact that the quantity of transported goods was not stated uniformly in the databases.
In cases where it was not possible to unambiguously assign data on individual transports in both records, the accompanying documents were checked and breaches of the conditional tax exemption regime were not detected, nor were cases of tax evasion detected.
Based on the findings of parallel controls, it can be stated that Member States can obtain valuable information from transport records to improve excise administration.
The establishment of an electronic system for the movement and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council will allow electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movement under suspension of excise duty within the European Union.
Communique
This report has been prepared in Czech, English and Slovak.
The report was signed by the Chairman of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic.
Administration of value added tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the results of the ex - post control
Foreword
Taxes are generally a key source of public revenue.
It is therefore self-evident that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) should focus on this area.
An example is value added tax (VAT) fraud.
In their case, an annual loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated in the European Union (EU).
Already in 2005, the participants of VI. the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.
As part of this cooperation, SAIs can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.
VAT is a very good area for control cooperation, as it is the only tax harmonized within the EU.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also "SAO") and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, hereinafter also "BRH") carried out the first parallel VAT audit in 2006.
The relevant report was published in 2008.
As VAT fraud is not limited to a single country but is widespread across the EU, close cooperation between SAIs is needed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this issue.
The two SAIs therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a subsequent parallel inspection.
1. Introduction
Inspection number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of inspection: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration (D) Bilateral audit with the SAO (follow-up inspection)
Objective of the inspection:
(CZ) The aim of the audit was to examine the procedure of financial authorities in the administration of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure for resolving selected cases of business transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany ("Germany"), and to examine the procedures of tax administrations of both countries in international cooperation .
(D) The audit was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and the BRH.
The intention was also to cover other areas related to VAT.
The resulting control findings were intended for comparison with identified best practice (if any).
The audited period was the years 2006 to 2008, in the case of factual connections also the period preceding and following, until the end of the audit.
2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
The subsequent audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.
During previous parallel inspections, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.
Some of them required further verification.
Based on the audit findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations regarding VAT administration.
The follow-up action was carried out to evaluate the measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspicious cases.
The audit also focused, for example, on selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of receivables and the implementation of VAT audits of large tax entities.
During the audit of VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, the auditors came to the following audit findings:
1. Recommendations from the previous inspection
• Recommendation 1: The conditions for registration of payers should be harmonized across the EU
In previous parallel audits, a comparison of VAT registration systems in the two countries revealed differences.
Due to the different problems of different registration methods, both SAIs recommended harmonizing the conditions for payer registration within the EU.
This recommendation has been made at EU level.
The proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003") called for an extension existing databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
It also amended the common standards for the registration and registration of taxpayers.
The SAIs expected EU Member States to agree on appropriate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as soon as possible.
However, the latest version of this document, agreed by EU Member States in the framework of ECOFIN, no longer addresses this issue.
Both SAIs regret that the idea of ​​common minimum standards has been abandoned.
However, they continue to consider this intention to be a relevant prevention tool in the fight against VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary reports
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all EU countries introduce a one-month deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements, thus enabling a more timely verification of the values ​​of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions shortens the period for which recapitulative statements are lodged EU, for one month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented from 1 July 2010.
In Germany, the obligation to submit summary reports on a monthly basis was not introduced within the set deadline in accordance with the applicable EU regulations, while in the Czech Republic it was.
• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany in order to increase the reliability of VIES data and consider the interconnection of the two VAT return and recapitulative statements systems
The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to examine possible solutions.
The work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level Based on the results of a previous audit, both SAIs agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system need to be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.
If this is not the case, the perpetrators of fraud will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The audit found that our two Member States use different risk management systems, which have their strengths and weaknesses.
In this area, the SAO inspected the EUROCANET system, which enables the exchange of information within the EU, while the BRH focused on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.
2. Subsequent control of selected cases of intra-community transactions
During the previous audit, business transactions were examined jointly, where there were doubts about their execution or irregularities in the reporting of business transactions in tax returns or summary reports to taxpayers from both countries.
Both SAIs selected nine cases for follow-up, which involved the intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
The inspections carried out by the tax authorities of the countries concerned were not closed on the date of completion of our previous joint inspection.
The follow-up audit verified that most tax proceedings in connection with the selected cases of commercial transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany were closed and that adequate measures were taken by the Czech or German tax authorities (eg additional VAT additional assessments or avoidance of input tax refunds). ).
3. Control of selected cases of risky intra-community transactions
High-risk cases of intra-Community transactions executed by EU payers, which were included in the EUROCANET system, were selected for control.
The EUROCANET system is a tool for detecting risky taxpayers within the EU.
Member States' participation in this system is voluntary.
The Czech Republic is an active participant in the EUROCANET system, while Germany has a passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant in a system if some Member States refuse active participation.
Due to the fact that the German tax administration did not participate in the data exchange in the EUROCANET system, it was not possible to obtain any information on which suppliers with a German VAT ID were assessed as risky.
As part of the audit, the SAO identified both cases of ordinary business transactions and cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or VAT fraud.
Tax administrators have limited possibilities to control risky transactions, especially with regard to so-called missing traders, while the mere physical examination of documents can hardly prove to the tax subject any fraudulent conduct.
A similar situation for tax administrations arises when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intra-Community carousel shops.
In such cases, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities in order to identify goods and irregularities in transport documentation and also to monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the final consumer.
Germany, like some other countries, is hesitant to actively participate in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.
In Germany, other tools are used to detect risky taxpayers, which have so far proved their worth to the German tax administration.
There is a need to communicate and exchange experiences between EU Member States in this area.
The EU Council reached a political agreement on a draft regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Its main innovation is the creation of the EUROFISC network.
The experience gained so far with the use of EUROCANET should be the basis for the creation of this new network to combat VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
In the field of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States follow the same European legislation.
Therefore, the method of handling requests for international assistance in debt recovery in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.
The SAO and the BRH compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not match.
Both SAIs find it useful to renegotiate statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent discrepancies.
Without it, statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, SAIs agree that reliable statistics should include more information on VAT.
It would probably be useful for the Commission to carry out an analysis on the basis of more detailed statistics to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.
In the view of both SAIs, this means helping Member States with a low recovery success rate to increase their debt recovery rate to at least the EU average.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should be actively involved in this process.
5. Control of large tax subjects
The SAIs analyzed the legal situation regarding VAT control for large tax entities (hereinafter also "VDS") in both countries.
In addition, they collected information from tax administrations in the form of a questionnaire on areas that the SAIs consider essential for the management of this issue.
It is clear from the responses received that the situation in the two countries is developing differently.
The Czech Republic has a system in place to guide the selection of risk-prone cases, which is based on a large amount of relevant data (eg information from tax audits, data from balance sheets and profit and loss statements, etc.).
This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.
In 2012, it is planned to establish a specialized financial office for the administration of VDS.
A similar system does not yet exist in Germany, which makes it difficult to manage and analyze VAT control in general.
So far, Germany has focused more on the selection of the individual cases in question, in particular on the basis of data from the VAT return and the recapitulative statement.
The analysis of these data is based on the various components of risk management that will be strengthened.
3. The course of the control action
3.1 The course of the control action in the Czech Republic
The inspection was carried out in the period from May 2009 to February 2010 by Department II. - the state budget revenue department and the territorial departments IX. Pilsen, X. Ceske Budejovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.
The auditees were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also referred to as the "Czech Ministry of Finance") and 25 financial authorities (hereinafter also referred to as the "FI"): the Brno II, the Brno III, the Brno IV, the Břeclav, the Domažlice, the in Hodonín, FI in Hradec Králové, FI in Cheb, FI in Jablonec nad Nisou, FI in Karlovy Vary, FI in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FI in Kraslice, FI Ostrava I, FI Ostrava III, FI in Písek, FI in Pilsen, FI for Prague 1, FI for Prague 4, FI for Prague 8, FI in Rakovník, FI in Sokolov, FI in Tábor, FI in Vysoké Mýto, FI in Zlín and FI in Žamberk.
The audit conclusion from this audit was approved by the Board of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.
3.2 The course of the inspection in Germany
The audit was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the indirect tax audit service and the staff of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
After selecting a sample of cases, a number of Länder were informed of the mission of the inspection.
In addition to interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, inspections took place in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.
The tax files of the following tax offices were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Tax Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);
In addition, negotiations took place with the tax authorities of Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-South) and with the financial directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
A report on audit findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two control institutions
As part of the preparation of parallel inspections, a meeting of representatives of both inspection institutions took place in September 2008 to discuss and determine inspection topics.
Subsequently, in December 2008, the top officials of the two SAIs signed an agreement on cooperation in carrying out parallel inspections.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams informed each other of the initial results achieved during the preparation of the audit, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on the way forward.
The second meeting took place in Prague on 2-4 December 2009.
The inspection teams exchanged the findings collected so far and agreed on a timetable for drawing up a joint report.
In carrying out parallel audits, both SAIs decided to focus on: • follow-up of the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, • examination of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between Czech and German taxpayers that were not resolved during the previous parallel audit; transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany, which were classified as high-risk cases, • control of the procedure of tax administrations in the field of international assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables, • tax control of large companies.
A report on the results of the parallel inspections was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Control of VAT administration in selected areas
4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from the previous inspection
4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
The conditions for the registration of payers should be harmonized within the EU
Based on the results of the previous audit, the SAO recommended an adjustment of the conditions for VAT registration and the introduction of a new rule for the cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.
The revised conditions should make it possible to reduce more effectively the risk of possible tax evasion in the collection of VAT.
In this context, it was found that in some cases the tax authorities did not use the right to cancel VAT registration for taxpayers who did not fulfill their obligations under Act No. 235/2004 Coll., On Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Act”).
The Czech Ministry of Finance has not yet proposed a change in the provision consisting in the introduction of the obligation of tax administrators to cancel VAT registration for taxpayers in the event of repeated failure to file a VAT return.
According to the VAT Act, the tax administrator may cancel the registration of a taxpayer “ex offo” in cases where: a) the taxpayer has not performed without notification of the reason to the tax administrator for twelve consecutive months of performance, b) the taxpayer fails to fulfill his obligations under this Act; ) the taxpayer ceases to be a taxable person.
In the previous audit, it was found that the applicable legislation allowed the FI for Prague 1 to cancel VAT registration as of 31 January of the following calendar year for so-called non-established payers who did not incur any obligation to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.
The FI for Prague 1 often did not cancel the VAT registration for these payers, as the relevant provision set an insufficient deadline for canceling the registration.
This problem was eliminated by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.
The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-established taxpayer if the taxpayer did not supply any taxable goods or services or exempt goods or services with the right to deduct VAT in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of summary reports
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all EU countries introduce a one-month deadline for submitting recapitulative statements.
The Council Directive reduces the period for which recapitulative statements are submitted for intra-EU transactions to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.
The obligation to submit summary reports in electronic form is also newly established.
The recapitulative statement must be submitted by the taxable person even if the services for which the place of supply is determined pursuant to Section 9 (1) of the VAT Act are provided to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State and obliged to declare and pay the tax to their recipient.
This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC as regards the place of supply of services.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in order to increase the reliability of VIES data This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.
The Czech administration compares data on intra-Community transactions reported in VAT tax returns and summary reports of Czech taxpayers automatically in the ADIS system.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level
Proper collection of VAT is one of the necessary preconditions for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
The fight against VAT fraud is therefore one of the priority areas and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this fight is evidenced, among other things, by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator tried to determine the difference between eligible and actually collected VAT in 25 EU Member States ("EU-25") during the period 2000-2006. .
Based on an analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concludes that the estimated amount of uncollected VAT loss for this period is € 90-113 billion, with an average of 12% of eligible VAT not collected annually in the EU-25.
For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was estimated at as much as 18%.
In the framework of international cooperation, it was stated in a previous audit that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by only one Member State.
The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.
As regards the risk management system, the SAO audited the EUROCANET system for the exchange of information in the EU.
Cases of risky intra-Community transactions carried out by EU taxpayers included in the EUROCANET system were selected for control (see Chapter 4.3).
The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved by setting up the EUROFISC network, which should improve cooperation between the responsible authorities so that fraud can be detected at an early stage.
This network should later also become an important source of information in assessing the risks of intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council already approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7 October 200812 and set out the basic principles that will guide the network.
EUROFISC is modeled on the already functioning EUROCANET rapid and selective information exchange system, developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.
The aim of this system is to detect risky business transactions and entities involved in organized VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report revealed the following findings:
Recommendation 1
The conditions for the registration of payers should be harmonized within the EU
The German tax administration has set up a well-functioning taxpayer registration system based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance drew the Commission's attention to this system in October 2007.
System improvements are performed continuously.
At present, the data from the questionnaire are processed electronically and will subsequently be used for research as part of risk management already during registration.
The Commission presented a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
Member States have requested further clarification and elaboration of this issue.
The BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure the already achieved level of standards in this area in Germany.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of summary reports
On 8 April 2010, a law was adopted to transpose EU directives into national law.
This law contains provisions concerning the monthly submission of summary reports on intra-Community supplies.
These provisions entered into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in order to increase the reliability of VIES data and consider the interconnection of the two VAT return and recapitulative statements systems
A joint working group was set up consisting of staff from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The Group has developed a strategy for automatically comparing data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
This strategy is still being discussed in the Länder.
Furthermore, the working group discussed a tool designed to optimize the control process for transactions in the internal market.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.
Germany is participating in this exchange within the so-called risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the idea of ​​this platform and, following a written consultation of 18 October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 action plan.
The members of the platform are further divided into subgroups that deal with individual topics, such as: • risk management tools, • influencing actions, • evaluation, • updating the risk management guide.
At the beginning of 2010, reports on the results of the activities of these subgroups were published.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and the cancellation of this registration in various countries has been addressed at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included the extension of existing databases within the EU, including the database of VAT identification numbers.
It also amended common minimum standards for the registration and registration of taxpayers.
The issue of registration and cancellation of registration has so far been left to the national legislation of the EU Member States.
Member States have requested further clarification and elaboration of this issue.
The BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already achieved in Germany did not fall.
On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached a political agreement on the above-mentioned proposal for a Regulation.
The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
Member States have to implement national procedures and are only obliged to inform the Administrative Cooperation Committee about these procedures.
Both SAIs regret that the Commission has failed to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, as both SAIs consider this measure to be an important element in preventing VAT fraud.
They would therefore welcome further efforts by the Commission in this direction.
Monthly submission of summary reports
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all EU countries introduce a one-month deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements, allowing for earlier verification of the values ​​of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions shortens the period for which recapitulative statements are lodged EU, for one month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it entered into force on 1 July 2010.
Germany has not introduced the obligation to submit summary reports on a monthly basis according to a set calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in line with EU directives).
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany in order to increase the reliability of VIES data and consider the interconnection of the two VAT return and recapitulative statements systems
The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.
The work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level
Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.
The SAO inspected the EUROCANET system used for the exchange of information in the EU (see Chapter 4.3).
In this area, BRH focused on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.
4.2 Follow-up of selected cases of intra-Community transactions
In the previous audit, the implementation of business transactions was jointly examined, in which there were doubts about their implementation, resp. inconsistencies in the way taxpayers from both countries reported these business transactions in their VAT returns, resp. summary reports.
Both audit institutions selected nine cases for ex-post control involving the intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the audit carried out by the tax administrations of both countries was not completed during the previous joint audit.
1)
In the first quarter of 2005, the Czech payer purchased goods worth EUR 22,686 from a German payer.
This acquisition of goods was not acknowledged by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return, as the German taxpayer was not assigned a VAT ID during that period, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that under the German VAT law a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order to exempt intra-Community supplies. from VAT.
A subsequent audit of the SAO revealed that, based on an inspection carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer filed an additional VAT return, in which he declared the acquisition of goods in the stated value and also claimed the same amount of VAT deduction in this tax return.
2)
In the 4th quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to purchase goods worth EUR 12,561 from the German payer.
The Czech taxpayer denied the acquisition of these goods and did not state them in his VAT return.
The German tax authorities refused to cooperate on request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, as the turnover of the transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence, he terminated the inspection without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed in the original amount.
Following the SAO's inspection, it found that the Czech tax administrator had received two spontaneous information from Germany pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German taxpayer had invoiced the goods to Slovakia.
The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated this acquisition in the regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.
3)
In the 4th quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to purchase a car worth EUR 48,500 from the German payer.
The Czech taxpayer did not admit the acquisition of the goods in question.
This taxpayer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004, so the tax administrator assessed VAT of CZK 0 for the quarter.
On the basis of information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, in March 2007 the tax administrator invited the taxpayer to file an additional VAT return, which the taxpayer did not.
A subsequent inspection revealed that the tax administrator had performed further acts in the tax proceedings in 2007, which showed that the Czech payer sold the car in question to a second-hand car dealership in the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administrator issued a payment order for the tax period of December 2004, by which he additionally assessed VAT for the acquisition of goods from another Member State and their subsequent sale in the amount of CZK 295,379.
By a resolution of the regional court, the Czech payer was abolished with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.
In the absence of foreclosures of the taxable debtor's eligible assets, this arrears appear to be irrecoverable.
4)
The Czech payer was to deliver new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany during the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005 in the total amount of EUR 198,167.
The reply to the request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that there were pending tax criminal proceedings against the German entity in Germany.
During the follow-up inspection, the BRH was informed that after the end of the tax proceedings in Germany, it was demonstrably established that the German taxpayer had been involved in fraudulent activities.
The intra-Community acquisition of goods was taxed at EUR 182 424 (2004) and EUR 369 690 (2005).
The SAO's follow-up inspection found that the Czech payer was involved in carousel transactions with new means of transport.
On the basis of information from the German tax administration concerning the verification of the supply of goods, a VAT audit was initiated at the Czech tax entity for the tax periods of April, May and June 2005.
Based on audit findings and information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additionally assessed VAT in the amount of CZK 703,031 for the period of May 2005 and CZK 726,551 for the period of June 2005.
5)
In February 2005, the Czech payer A was to purchase a machine from the German payer with a total value of EUR 58,000.
This German payer was to deliver a machine worth EUR 88,027 to the Czech payer B in the third quarter of 2004, but payer B denied the acquisition of the goods.
A subsequent inspection by the SAO revealed that payer B had purchased the machine from a German company which had an organizational unit in the Czech Republic.
The Czech taxpayer A did not report the acquisition of goods from the German taxpayer in his VAT return.
The reply from the German tax administrator to the request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German taxpayer did not make an intra-Community supply of machinery worth EUR 58 000, but a supply of goods within the Czech Republic.
Following a follow-up inspection, the BRH found that, following a tax audit, the intra-Community supply of the machine had been reclassified as a domestic supply of the machine and the VAT exemption had been abolished.
6)
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer was to supply the Czech taxpayer with goods worth EUR 11,600.
The goods were bought and subsequently sold in 2005 in Germany.
Following the SAO's audit, it found that the Czech tax administrator had assessed the submitted additional VAT return, which wrongly stated the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State, including the acquisition of goods in the stated value.
The BRH found that, after receiving a reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax administrator corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and additionally assessed VAT of EUR 1 600.
The further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany is subject to tax control.
The recapitulative statement of a German payer has not yet been corrected, as corrections to recapitulative statements in Germany can only be made by the payer who submitted the recapitulative statement.
7)
The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 as to whether a Czech taxpayer purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47,400 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
Following the tax proceedings for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator imposed a tax liability of CZK 0 on the Czech taxpayer and informed the German tax administrator that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
A subsequent audit by the SAO revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was canceled in 2007 due to non-fulfillment of obligations and the Czech tax administrator sent the documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.
Following the inspection, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had changed his registered office and the new locally competent tax administrator had revoked the VAT exemption for the supply of the car in question to the Czech taxpayer on the basis of the inspection.
The German taxpayer has not yet corrected the data in the recapitulative statement and has lodged an appeal against the decision of the tax administrator.
8)
According to data from the VIES system, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer in the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005 with goods with a total value of EUR 33,205.
Following the SAO's inspection, it was found that the Czech tax administrator tried to find out the causes of the differences that arose with the Czech taxpayer in the acquisition of goods in the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer repeatedly filed an additional VAT return for the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech tax administrator did not explain the difference in the value of acquired goods in the amount of CZK 134,273 for the period from Q3 2004 to Q1 2005, because according to the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture business transactions for individual quarters, and therefore the tax administrator accepted the additional tax confession.
9)
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer in the amount of EUR 46,854.
For the same period, the Czech payer declared an intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14,856.
The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of the performed supplies within the international exchange of information according to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.
The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of the supply of goods of EUR 31,998, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer in the VAT return and the data in VIES.
A subsequent audit by the SAO revealed that the Czech taxpayer had submitted an additional tax return for VAT for the tax period July 2004 to January 2007, after many urgencies.
In this tax return, the taxpayer also claimed the right to deduct VAT, which left the tax liability for the said tax period unchanged.
The follow-up audit verified that in selected cases of business transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most tax proceedings were completed and that tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Germany took adequate measures (ie additionally assessed VAT or prevented input tax refunds).
4.3 Control of selected cases of risky intra-community transactions
4.3.1 Results of the inspection in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information for the detection of risk entities within the Member State where the goods were acquired.
In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from the EUROCANET system was compared with the relevant local tax authorities with the data on the acquirers.
Starting in the first quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic sends data on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers to the EUROCANET system.
Within the framework of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system were selected for inspection.
These entities acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.
Relevant data from tax administrations from other Member States were recorded in EUROCANET.
As the German tax administration did not participate in the EUROCANET data exchange, no information could be obtained to help determine whether suppliers with a German VAT ID were assessed by the German tax administration as risky entities.
The audit revealed cases of ordinary business transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or VAT fraud.
Where appropriate, tax administrations benefited from the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
For example:
• Tax authorities did not reveal any suspicions of involvement in risky transactions during the verification of signal information.
The tax authorities continuously monitor such tax entities due to their inclusion in the EUROCANET system.
• During the verification of risky transactions, the tax authorities did not show any deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax and VAT base in the submitted accounts, although they found irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or revealed business relationships with suspicious or non-contact companies from other Member States.
• The verification of business transactions was complicated as some taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax authorities and could not be contacted.
The locally competent tax authorities mostly examined risky tax entities and risky transactions listed in the signal information from the EUROCANET system.
Tax administrators have limited possibilities when examining risky transactions, especially in connection with the examination of so-called missing traders, and it is difficult to prove fraudulent conduct to the tax subject only from the physical control of documents.
Stricter VAT registration requirements and more flexible cancellation of registrations would help reduce missing trader fraud.
In the case of taxable persons involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered for the purpose of reporting fictitious supplies of goods within the EU or for the purpose of issuing formally correct tax documents to taxpayers who unduly draw input VAT deductions.
In cases where the involvement of taxable persons in carousel transactions and other fraud is suspected and goods are imported and exported from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities.
Closer cooperation between these authorities would help to identify goods and irregularities in transport documentation, as well as to monitor the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the final consumer.
The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in the operation of EUROCANET was assessed by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness of the system, which should be eliminated by setting up a mandatory EUROFISC network.
4.3.2 Results of the inspection in Germany
The BRH analyzed the information available from the Federal Central Tax Office, which contained data from the EUROCANET system.
These data were the criteria for selecting six files of German taxpayers for inspection.
Germany, like some other countries, has refused to actively participate in the EUROCANET system.
Germany thus has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.
The rationale for this position is contained in the following statement: .in the government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.
At present, there is no legal basis for breaching the applicable rules on the confidentiality of tax information.
In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such data is used by other Member States within EUROCANET. '
The German tax authorities receive control information on the direct business relations of the payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in the EUROCANET system.
However, the German tax authorities do not receive any information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relations with traders from other Member States who also maintain business relations with the German trader in question.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The Czech Republic is an active participant in the EUROCANET system, while Germany has a passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse active participation.
As a result, the inspection in the area had to be carried out in different ways.
However, the results did not reveal large differences in the detection of VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.
The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools for detecting fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The EU Council reached a political agreement on a draft regulation, the main benefit of which is the establishment of the EUROFISC network.
The experience gained in using EUROCANET data should be part of the envisaged anti-VAT fraud network.
Member States should therefore communicate their experience at European level.
On the other hand, cases brought before national and European courts show that a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemptions in intra-Community transactions appears to be necessary.
4.4 Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims
4.4.1 International assistance in debt collection in the Czech Republic
The basic regulations of international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU are in particular the following directives:
• Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to operations forming part of the system of financing by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;
• Council Directive 2001/44 / EC amending Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to operations forming part of the system of financing by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and customs duties, taxes value added and certain excise duties;
• Commission Directive 2002/94 / EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
In the Czech Republic, Council Directive No. 76/308 / EEC was implemented by Act No. 252/2000 Coll., On International Assistance in the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive No. 2001/44 / EC, it was necessary to implement this Directive into the Czech legal system and at the same time amend the said Act No. 252/2000 Coll.
In this context, a new Act No. 191/2004 Coll., On international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims, was adopted.
The new regulation in the system of regulation of international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annex to the regulation sets out new models of applications, which have been in use since 1 January 2009, and newly stipulates the obligation of electronic communication and the obligation of the requesting authority to confirm the conformity of the sent documents with the original document.
The main principles for providing international cooperation in debt collection:
1. reciprocity;
2. assistance is always provided only on the basis of an application containing the prescribed requirements;
3. the assistance does not cover financial claims which are of the nature of a criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. the provision of international debt recovery assistance shall be in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. foreign claims do not take precedence in recovery;
6. assistance is provided only for the recovery of uncontested claims;
7. Principle of exhaustion (the requesting State has made no successful use of all available possibilities to recover the claim provided for by its legal system).
Act No. 191/2004 Coll. it defines three forms in which assistance is provided, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the actual recovery of claims.
Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States
The locally competent tax office will electronically send a request for information, a request for delivery or a request for recovery of receivables together with the relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance via the Finance Directorate.
The Czech Ministry of Finance will ensure the translation of the application into the relevant language, scan it including the annexes and send it to the competent tax administration authority of the designated state via the CCN / CSI network.
There are two basic requirements for recovery: the claim must be higher than EUR 1 500 and must not be older than 5 years.
If these requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse recovery.
Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States
Upon receipt of an application from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must acknowledge receipt of the application as soon as possible, and no later than within seven days.
If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for rejecting the request and state the specific provisions of the Directive which it invokes.
This notification must be sent no later than three months from the date of acknowledgment of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance will verify that the application has all the requisites in accordance with the law, and should immediately forward the application through the Financial Directorate to the locally competent tax office for processing.
If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator ascertains, among other things, the debtor's property, eg by obtaining extracts from the real estate cadastre, ascertaining bank accounts, verifying the registration of vehicles at the traffic inspectorate, etc.
After six months from the date of acknowledgment of receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance should communicate to the requesting authority the result of the inquiry carried out in order to obtain the requested information.
In the case of non-contact tax entities where it is not possible to enforce the claim, the requesting authority should also be informed.
Each amount recovered by the tax administrator shall be transferred to the requesting authority in CZK within one month from the date on which the claim was recovered.
It is not excluded that the Czech tax administrator recovering foreign receivables may allow delay in its payment or payment in installments, if the state that requested recovery agrees.
During the recovery period, the debtor is prescribed interest or a penalty pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., On the Administration of Taxes and Fees.
This interest or penalty belongs to the state that requested the recovery.
In the case of received recovery requests, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not forward the requests to the locally competent tax administrators for processing in time, especially in 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was found in the framework of international assistance in the recovery of receivables in the case of applications received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance had not complied with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., As it had not notified the locally competent authority of the Member State of the progress of recovery within six months from the date of receipt of the request.
This situation has been improving since 2008.
Statistical data
The Czech Ministry of Finance in accordance with the provisions of Section 13, Paragraph 4 of Act No. 191/2004 Coll. processes, by 15 March each year, statistics for the European Commission indicating the number of requests for information, service or recovery sent or received in the previous year, indicating the amount of claims to which the requests relate.
The European Commission prepares a report on the state of debt recovery, which it submits to the EU Council and the European Parliament, on the basis of documents provided by all EU Member States.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated the statistical data due to an error in the item of recovered receivables in 2008 by 5,250 thousand. EUR, by stating the incorrect value of the recovered VAT receivable (it was a shift of the decimal point after the conversion of the receivable from Czech crowns to the value in euros).
This error was subsequently reflected in the European Commission's statistics.
Information on mutual assistance, including recoveries, is provided in the table below.
4.4.2 International debt recovery assistance in Germany
The legal authorization for international administrative assistance in tax matters is derived from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55 / ​​EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and the Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (Implementing Directive ES).
In the interests of more accessible wording and clarity, the EC Debt Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308 / EEC of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have been substantially amended several times.
The provisions apply, inter alia, to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.
The EC Debt Recovery Directive was transposed into German national law by the State Tax Collection Act (EC) of 3 May 2003.
The recovery procedure in Germany is governed by the German Fiscal Code.
Article 117.2 of the Code emphasizes that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities in force under national jurisdiction and on the basis of the EC Law on Administrative Assistance.
Part Six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346) lays down statutory provisions governing the enforcement procedure.
The administrative acts of the tax authorities are governed in particular by the instructions for execution and the instructions for enforcement.
The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with the representatives of the Länder on the principles of administrative assistance in the assessment of taxes and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The general preconditions for submitting applications for recovery are the following:
• Legal requirements must be met (§ 251 and § 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).
• All available domestic means of recovery have already been exhausted.
• Receivables that are the subject of requests for recovery assistance must be final.
• No more than 5 years may elapse between the issuance of the recovery order or the date on which the claim becomes final (ie it is no longer the subject of an appeal) until the date of submission of applications.
• The total amount of the claim must be higher than EUR 1,500.
Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States
German requests for recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the tax authorities' executive departments to the relevant foreign authority, such as the Czech CLO, through the intermediate office and the Federal Central Tax Office.
The follow-up procedure is governed by the Guidelines on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Debt Collection) of 19 January 2004.25 A working group of the Federal Government and the Provincial Governments is currently reviewing this guideline to bring it into line with the Debt Recovery Directive.
The application, including annexes, is submitted by the tax office electronically to the intermediate office.
This office will check the correctness of the application in terms of content and form.
If the application is not correct, it is returned to the relevant tax office.
If it meets all the requirements, it is handed over to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then ensure the necessary communication with the relevant foreign office and will also ensure the translation of the application.
Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery received from other Member States are registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and within 10 days they send an acknowledgment of receipt.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office will check whether the formal requirements have been met.
The Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the intermediate office, which then forwards them to the relevant tax authorities and monitors their settlement.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.
If the application takes longer than 6 months, the Intermediate Office will invite you to submit a preliminary report, which must be submitted in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94 / DG.
After checking the formal and factual details of the application, the implementing services will notify the method of recovery.
All amounts recovered must be transferred to the bank account specified in the application within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual assistance in the recovery of receivables between Germany and the Czech Republic in the years 2006-2008 (as of 31 December 2008) is contained in the following table.
4.4.3 Debt collection control, case studies
Within the framework of international cooperation, 21 applications for international assistance in the recovery of receivables between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for inspection.
Examination of ten selected cases revealed, among other things:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany to recover a VAT claim for 2004 and 2005 in the total amount of EUR 3,883, ie CZK 109,820, from a Czech tax entity.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send a request for recovery to the tax administrator until 26 February 2008.
In order to secure the recovered receivable, the Czech tax administrator established a lien on real estate owned by a Czech tax entity.
As it was not possible to settle the entire recovered receivable even by mortgaging the real estate, an installment calendar was agreed with the Czech tax entity with installments in the amount of min. 2,000 CZK per month.
On 31 August 2009, information on the status of recovery of the receivable was sent to the German tax administration, stating that as of 25 August 2009, this receivable had been partially recovered in installments in the amount of CZK 49,600.
This amount was sent to Germany and on 28 August 2009 another installment of CZK 3,000 was sent to Germany.

On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax arrears of a Czech tax entity that owed EUR 180,869 in Germany, ie CZK 4,434,915, for VAT and income tax and accessories.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the tax administrator until 27 November 2008.
By examining the ownership of accounts with banks, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movables, the tax administrator found that the debtor did not own any enforceable assets.
Furthermore, a local investigation revealed that the debtor did not stay at the address of permanent residence for almost a year.
His place of residence in the Czech Republic is unknown.
This notification was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and on 16 April 2009 the tax administrator's reply was sent to the German tax administration.

On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for recovery of tax arrears on sales tax and accessories of a Czech tax entity in the amount of EUR 3,139, ie CZK 84,846.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery of this receivable to the tax administrator on 6 August 2008, although on 18 February 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the receivable in Germany.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax administrator that the request for recovery was settled by the payment of a receivable by a Czech tax entity in Germany.
However, the receivable in question was also paid as part of recovery in the Czech Republic and transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the long time limits in which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the authorized tax administrator, in this case the receivable was paid twice - by the entity itself in Germany and the recovery of the receivable by the Czech tax administrator.
In cooperation with the BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been included in the claim from another recovery request in the amount of EUR 6,649, which was to be sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance registers with this company only a request for recovery of a claim in the amount of EUR 3,139, a request for recovery of a claim in the amount of EUR 6,649 does not appear in the records of the Czech Ministry of Finance with the company in question.

On 1 June 2009, the debt collection procedure was initiated, and execution was ordered to order a receivable on accounts with banks in the Czech Republic and to deduct it from wages (the deduction was CZK 7,000).
During the meeting with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he did not agree with the amount of the receivable and considered it disputed.
The Czech tax administrator found that in the past the tax entity was willing to repay EUR 250 per month, which was not accepted by the German tax administrator.
The taxpayer promised to discuss the application with the German tax administrator in order to obtain a change in the amount of his claim.
Recovery of the receivable continued during the SAO's audit.

On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning a Czech tax entity which owed a total of EUR 113,444 in income tax for 2005 and turnover tax for the period 2003-2007 and accessories, ie 3 116,304 CZK.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send a request to the FI for Prague 1, which is responsible for tax administration for non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, until 14 November 2008, as it was not possible to determine the locally competent tax administrator on the basis of the tax address.
During the investigation, the FI obtained information that the debtor had an income of EUR 4,704 on 19 September 2008; however, the FI could no longer issue an execution order for this amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance submitted the request for recovery of the claim only after this date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax administrator commenced recovery of the claim and issued an execution order to order a claim on the debtor's funds in accounts held with banks and savings and credit unions.
Recovery of the receivable continued during the SAO's audit.

During the verification of the volume of recovered receivables, an error was found in the recalculation of the amount recovered.
The amount recovered 146,223,742 CZK was converted at the rate of 1 EUR = 25,065 CZK incorrectly to 583,378 EUR.
The correct conversion of the amount recovered is EUR 5 833 781.83.
A request for recovery was therefore sent to Germany, which was lower by EUR 5 250 404.

On 1 March 2007, the Czech Tax Administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance to recover a tax arrears from a Czech tax entity that owed CZK 1,970,632, ie EUR 79,847, for VAT and accessories.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the application to the German tax administration until 10 November 2008.
On 4 February 2009, the German tax administrator called on the debtor to pay the arrears.
In view of the significant declines in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and especially in the first half of 2009 and the associated liquidation situation, the following payments were made to cover arrears: on 4 April 2009 the amount of EUR 4,600, on 6 May 2009 2009 an amount of EUR 3 000 and on 16.6.2009 an amount of EUR 2 500.

A request for recovery of a receivable in the total amount of EUR 398,653, ie CZK 9,832,779, including a receivable from real estate transfer tax, was delivered from the Czech Tax Administrator to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2 October 2008.
On 3 April 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a notification from the German tax administration that the application had been returned by the German tax administration.
The German tax authorities justified the refund by stating that the real estate transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (a). e), f), g) or letter (h) Council Directive 2008/55 / ​​EC.
The German tax authorities further stated that Article 2 (a) (g) relates to income tax and property taxes.
Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive 2008/55 / ​​EC applies to taxes on income and on capital, which are listed in Article 1 (3) in conjunction with paragraph 4 of Council Directive 77/799 / EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to prepare and submit a new application for recovery, excluding arrears of real estate transfer tax in the amount of CZK 61,759 and indicating arrears of VAT, corporate income tax and personal income tax, which will be resent to the German tax authority. administration.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the Czech tax administrator for the recovery of tax arrears concerning the same tax entity that owes CZK 7,079,735 in income tax and VAT.

Prior to sending the request for recovery, the Czech tax administrator executed the debtor's funds on bank accounts and deducted his salary and established a lien on the immovable property.
Requests for recovery were preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authorities on 16 March 2005.
The reply to the request for information, which the Czech tax administrator received on 16 September 2005, showed that the Czech tax entity was resident in Germany and had income from non-business activities in the amount of EUR 8,437.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery on 20 April 2006, but did not forward it to the Czech tax administrator until 12 February 2008.
The reply stated that no recovery procedure could be initiated in Germany due to the debtor's insolvency - no assets had been identified and his income from non-business activities was already subject to another enforcement procedure.
The German tax administration thus considered the request for recovery to be processed.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the field of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States follow the same European legislation.
Therefore, the method of handling requests for international assistance in debt recovery in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.
The SAO and the BRH compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not match.
In a 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay increased attention to the management of their statistics.
In a 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of inconsistencies in statistics had decreased, although the number of requests had increased.
Both SAIs consider it important that statistical issues be re-discussed at EU level.
This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent discrepancies, otherwise the data reported by individual EU countries in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, the two SAIs agree that reliable statistics should show the annual number of applications as well as the nature of the claims in question (ie whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) and the amount of claims recovered by each Member State.
Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyzes of the statistics provided by Member States, as this can help Member States to assess their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.
The fact that debt recovery rates can be calculated broken down by Member State is considered useful by both SAIs in intensifying Member States with a lower recovery rate and trying to improve the recovery rate to at least the EU average.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should be actively involved in this process.
Especially in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for recovery of receivables to the locally competent tax administrators in time.
A similar situation was found for applications for international assistance received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance had not complied with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., On International Assistance in Debt Recovery, because it did not inform the locally competent authority of the Member State of the progress of recovery within six months from the date of receipt. applications.
4.5 Control of large tax entities
4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic
General information
The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.
The procedural procedure for the control of VDS is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., On the administration of taxes and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons who were established or established for business purposes and whose net turnover for the tax period stated in the personal / corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 billion or higher.
The classification of the tax entity among the VDS took place after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant tax period, for the first time in 2003.
A taxable person ceases to be classified as a VDS if, in three consecutive tax periods from the end of the period in which he filed the tax return on the basis of which he was classified as a VDS, his net turnover for the tax period fell below that threshold.
A tax subject may not be excluded from the VDS records without performing a tax audit of at least one tax for one tax period.
Until the end of 2009, all VDS were inspected at least every five years.
From 2010, a written evaluation of the tax subject must be performed at least once every 2 years, and the chosen subsequent procedure must eliminate tax risks and their negative impact on the correct assessment and collection of tax.
The FI control is focused on at least one type of tax; the tax administrator usually chooses several tax periods at once.
VDS were inspected by specialized inspection departments, which are established at a total of 13 FAs, or by employees of control departments of locally relevant FIs.
The Specialized Controls Department carries out tax audits within the scope set by the Director of the Finance Directorate.
In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines
• tax entities operating in unusual and specific fields of business;
• entities for which the implementation of a tax audit is professionally and time-consuming;
• entities with a branched territorial and organizational structure;
• Entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;
• Entities interconnected in chains and networks where large-scale tax evasion and undue lure of excessive deductions are suspected.
The number of tax audits performed by the specialized audit departments of the FI and the results of these audits are shown in Table 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed an amendment to Act No. 531/1990 Coll., On Territorial Financial Authorities, which consists in the establishment of a specialized FI with nationwide competence for selected tax entities (including legal entities established for business purposes) with a turnover of more than 2 billion. CZK).
4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany
General information
VAT controls on large companies follow the same rules as tax controls in general, ie the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: • German Fiscal Code (AO), • Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), • Tax Control Regulations (BpO).
Other methodological documents are also valid.
German Fiscal Code
The statutory provisions on control are enshrined in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - On-the-spot tax control. In particular, these articles lay down the rules on the admissibility of on-the-spot (ie on-premises) tax audits, their scope, division of responsibilities, form and content of the audit notice, audit principles, obligations of the taxable person to cooperate and the preconditions for conducting the final hearing. communication of the inspection report.
On-the-spot tax inspections are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).
Fiscal Administration Act Pursuant to Article 5.1, point 1, in conjunction with Article 19 of the Act, participation in on-site tax inspections carried out by tax authorities is mandatory for the Federal Central Tax Office.
The participating authorities shall agree on the spot on the spot and the extent of the participation of the Federal Central Tax Office in tax audits.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that the specific undertakings it selects be inspected at a time to be determined by it.
In such a case, it may declare rules for the conduct and content of inspections at the premises of these companies.
Regulations on tax audits Pursuant to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, regulations on tax audits (German abbreviation BpO 2000) were approved by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper chamber of the German parliament in which the federal governments are represented).
These administrative regulations apply to on-site inspections carried out by the tax authorities of the Länder as well as by the Federal Central Tax Office.
Enterprises are classified according to size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of the BpO 2000.
Large enterprises are subject to ex-post control (Article 4.2 BpO).
Pursuant to Article 33.1 of the BpO 2000, each informed tax office must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in the BpO 2000.
Methodical instructions
In addition to the above, the supplementary methodology for the tax administration provides the following guidelines:
• Uniform manual for special VAT inspections in Germany;
• the USLO manual, which sets out the methodology for the use of data on intra-Community trade relations kept in the VIES system;
• the ZAUBER manual, which sets out the methodology for using the ZAUBER database;
• work aids for various and special subjects.
The classification of tax subjects is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits according to the type of business.
The data are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the next three years.
The number of companies to be inspected - not just large ones - must be determined at regular inspection intervals.
In general, inspections of large companies are carried out on an ongoing basis.
Checks are usually announced, including VAT checks.
This means that during the audit, the final validity of the audit will be mainly income taxes, excise duties and VAT - ie inspections of all types of relevant taxes.
VAT checks can be performed by either tax inspectors or VAT inspectors.
Implementation varies and depends on the organizational structure of the Länder.
The number of tax periods covered by audits is usually between three and five years.
BpO 2000 assumes a control period of three years.
All taxes of the company are subject to verification.
4.5.3 Management of control of large tax entities
Both SAIs decided not to examine individual cases of VDS inspections, but focused on management issues in order to gain an overview of how tax administrations manage the issue of VAT inspections at VDS.
In the form of a questionnaire, they gathered information from tax administrators on areas they consider essential for the management of this issue.
• What statistical records and analyzes concerning the VAT control of VDS are available to the tax administration management?
Especially:
• Are there any statistics or records of the extent to which a distinction is made between the fight against VAT fraud and VAT control in general?
Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow such a resolution in the current data version.
Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between controls designed to combat VAT fraud and general VAT controls.
• Are there any statistics or records on the timeliness of VAT controls (in relation to the time period of the transactions audited)?
Czech Republic: Records of the timeliness of inquiries with relevance for intra-Community acquisitions of goods for selected VAT payers are reported in the ADIS system.
In addition, the information recorded in the ADIS system also includes data on the type of query duration.
Germany: No, the uniform statistics at federal level for tax auditors only contain information on the average time of the last audit (information on the year).
This information does not provide an overview of selected control periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.
VAT inspectors focus on the most recent tax assessment period; they also have the right to carry out VDS inspections.
However, statistics produced at federal level for the VAT special control services do not provide information on the classification of taxable persons.
• Are there any statistics or records on the nature of the additional tax revenue generated, broken down, for example, according to the following criteria:
i. a net increase in the tax liability (eg in cases where the taxable person has unduly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);
ii. only a nominal increase in the tax liability (eg transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax period);
iii. additional collection of tax revenue (payment of additional tax due).
Czech Republic:
The Czech Tax Administration monitors the number of tax audits performed, the volumes of additionally assessed tax broken down by type of tax, by the number of audited tax entities and by the number of audited tax periods.
Other tax procedures (local investigations, reprimand proceedings) are monitored in the same way.
Time data and amounts of additionally paid taxes are recorded as a separate task.
General debt statistics are also kept broken down by type of tax, but not by declared tax or tax established by the tax administrator.
Germany: No, uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and for special VAT control departments do not distinguish between these criteria.
In addition, these differences are not distinguished by most of the tax administrations visited.
• Are there areas of control that give rise to high additional revenues?
Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to select taxpayers for verification on the basis of criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special sections of ADIS.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
It follows that uniform statistics at the federal level for tax inspectors and for special VAT control departments do not provide such data.
However, there is one coordinated approach by the finance ministers of the Länder and the federal government.
In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must enter the increased tax (VAT) liability imposed by them if they exceed a certain amount.
In such a case, it must specify, for example, the nature of the assessed increase in the tax liability.
• What findings are most common?
Czech Republic:
- VDS asserts an unjustified right to deduct input tax on supplies and services:
• which have not been used to carry out any economic activity pursuant to Section 72 (1) of the VAT Act;
• which have been used for representation pursuant to Section 75 (3) of the VAT Act;
• on the basis of tax documents that did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73 (1) of the VAT Act;
- VDS did not declare output VAT pursuant to Section 21 (1) of the VAT Act.
Germany: It was stated that there are no regulations at federal level.
It follows that uniform statistics at the federal level for tax inspectors and for special VAT control departments do not provide such data.
Findings concerning VAT are not recorded separately by the Länder if they result from VDS tax audits.
However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder have to enter the increased tax (VAT) liability imposed by them if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyze this information.
• Does the tax administration analyze areas of control that give rise to high “revenue” and draw implications for management?
Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they are launching national audits focusing on risky commodities or the subject of economic activity.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
Uniform statistics at the federal level for tax controllers and for the special VAT control departments do not provide data on audit areas from which high "revenues" flow.
There are differing views on the analysis process as well as on case management in terms of relevance.
Some regional tax authorities provide special information, but their use is at the discretion of the tax authorities.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
The differences in the responses of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a lot of data from tax audits and data from financial statements - balance sheets and profit and loss statements.
Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to guide the selection of risk-prone cases.
The same applies to the analysis and management of VAT control in general.
In 2012, it is planned to establish a specialized financial office for the administration of VDS in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.
It follows that it is more difficult to perform these tasks in a similar way.
However, Germany's philosophy places more emphasis on the selection of individual cases on the basis of data from submitted tax returns.
The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.
On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to assess the exact amount of VAT.
Both SAIs agree that Member States should be able to ensure adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.
This will help reduce shortfalls in VAT revenues.
As a result, the revenue from VAT collection will increase and the level of risk detection for unreliable entrepreneurs will also improve.
5. Conclusion
The cooperation of both SAIs on parallel inspections of the VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and the BRH.
The two SAIs became better acquainted with the systems in force in the following areas: • intra-Community transactions, • VAT risk management, in particular as regards the selection of risk-prone transactions, • assistance in recovering VAT receivables, and • VAT control for large tax entities.
Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in the strategies for detecting cases of VAT fraud were revealed, as well as differences in the above-mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Control findings were compared and best practices were identified.
In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to launch a debate on approaches and strategies within Member States, including at European Commission level.
The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of the two SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT administration.
