Report on the results of the parallel controls carried out in 2005 on the administration of value added tax between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Opening Word
The submitted material informs about the progress and results of parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the area of value added tax administration and the use of the VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).
In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so the revenue from value added tax affects not only the national budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.
Parallel control actions were aimed in particular at checking the tax authorities' procedures for verifying the amount of value added tax paid on commercial transactions between Member States of the European Union.
The introduction of the VIES system has enabled the electronic exchange of information on the registration of VAT payers in the Member States of the European Union and on the commercial transactions carried out by them.
The mismatch between the VIES data and the data in the VAT return submitted by the payer should alert the tax administrator to suspicious cases and allow the detection of tax evasion or fraud.
The benefits of the parallel controls were not only in the exchange of information on the procedure of the tax or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax, but in particular in the examination of the use of the VIES system in the control of the application of the right to exemption from value added tax in intra-community transactions.
The lessons learned from the implementation of parallel controls contribute to the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in the implementation of further parallel controls in cooperation with the control institutions of the Member States of the European Union.
Report on the results of parallel inspections of the administration of value added tax for the period from 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005
Introduction
Inspection number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005
Subject of the audit: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration, (SK) Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU Member States
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic) concluded on 12 September 2005 the Contract on Cooperation in Audit Activities.
The object of the contract was cooperation in parallel audits “Value Added Tax Administration”, included in the audit plan of the SAO CR for 2005 under No. 05/19 and “Control of the tax authorities’ procedure for the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU member countries”, included in the audit plan of the SAO SR under No. 22/2005.
The control actions carried out in parallel had the character of a coordinated control.
The result of the joint coordinated inspection was processed within the meaning of the European Implementing Regulation No 31 for INTOSAI control standards.
The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information to the extent provided for in the contract concluded and the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the parallel checks.
The purpose of the coordinated inspection was to verify selected cases of supply and acquisition of goods in suspicious commercial transactions between VAT payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Slovak Republic).
Both parties contractually undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the electronic system VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on received and sent requests to verify commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
The checks were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.
In the Czech Republic, the audit was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited bodies were the Ministry of Finance and 12 financial offices: the Financial Office in Mladá Boleslav, the Financial Office in Kolín, the Financial Office in Teplice, the Financial Office in Karlovy Vary, the Financial Office in Tábor, the Financial Office in Brno III, the Financial Office in Znojmo, the Financial Office in Zlín, the Financial Office in Šumperk, the Financial Office in Ostrava I, the Financial Office for Prague 7 and the Financial Office for Prague 9.
The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic was carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the Expoziturami SAO of the Slovak Republic Banská Bystrica and Košice at 9 selected tax offices: Tax Office of Bratislava I, Tax Office of Komárno, Tax Office of Trenčín, Tax Office of Prievidza, Tax Office of Zvolen, Tax Office of Dolný Kubín, Tax Office of Košice II, Tax Office of Košice V and Tax Office of Michalovce.
Objective of controls:
The aim of the parallel audits was to examine the procedure of the financial and tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (hereinafter "VAT") after the integration of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter "EU") and to examine the use of the electronic information system VIES, in particular when checking the application of the VAT exemption.
The audited coordinated inspection period covered the period from 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions An electronic VIES system is in place in EU Member States to allow tax authorities to check whether the supplier has been authorised to exempt the taxable transaction from VAT and to check in the country of destination whether the purchaser has duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.
The VIES system is not centralised within the EU, with each Member State developing its own system.
The audit found differences in national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the following areas:
The recapitulative statements indicate the values of deliveries to other EU Member States, the values of services provided are not included in the recapitulative statements.
Data from recapitulative statements submitted by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of the tax authorities, where they are compared with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States listed in VAT returns.
The tax authorities transmit the data from the recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.
In SR, data from recapitulative statements filed by Slovak payers at tax offices are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of SR (CLO).
In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of supplies of goods and services to other EU Member States on separate rows of VAT returns, which makes it possible to compare the values stated in the recapitulative statements with the values of supplies of goods according to VAT returns and to identify their possible differences.
In the SR, the values of goods and services supplied to other EU Member States are shown in aggregate on the common line of the VAT return.
Consequently, in the SR, the system does not allow the automatic identification of differences between the values of supplies of goods according to VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
Separate reporting of the value of supplies of goods in VAT returns makes it possible to use the results of data comparisons when checking the VAT exemption of supplies of goods to the EU.
The delivered data from recapitulative statements submitted by payers in other EU Member States are processed into Customs and compared with the value of acquisition of goods stated by payers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia in their VAT returns.
In the Slovak Republic, these data are sent to the tax authorities and the tax authorities themselves decide which cases of differences to check.
In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which quantified differences between the values of supplies and acquisitions of goods must be verified by the tax administrators and sends a list of these cases to the local tax authorities.
This ensures that, for the most important derogations, it will be verified whether the VAT on the acquisition of goods was correctly declared.
The audit also highlighted some problems in the VAT administration system, complications caused by different reporting of intra-Community transactions (i.e. supplies and acquisitions of goods made by payers from different EU Member States):
Aggregate reports are submitted in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum period for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.
The reduction of the period for which recapitulative statements are submitted to one month, together with the shortening of the processing time, would allow earlier access to VIES data.
Tax authorities would thus be able to check more effectively whether the VAT on intra-community acquisitions was correctly declared.
At the same time, the submission of VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same tax period (month) would allow faster verification of whether the payer has declared identical values for the supply of goods to the EU in both the recapitulative statement and the VAT return.
Differences between the values of deliveries of goods declared by EU payers and the values of acquisitions of goods declared by Czech and Slovak payers were due, among other things, to different reporting of data on intra-Community delivery and acquisitions in individual EU Member States.
These included, for example, the inclusion of received advances in the recapitulative statements, or the reporting of intra-community supplies in the supplier's recapitulative statement in a quarter other than the intra-community acquisitions in the acquirer's VAT return.
Unifying the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would make the control activities of the tax administrations of the Member States more effective.
The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was also focused on the examination of selected intra-community transactions carried out between the two countries.
Together, a total of 40 cases of commercial transactions between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined where there were doubts about their completion or suspicion of VAT evasion.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic found the following facts:
tax subjects have declared in their VAT returns, for the purpose of unduly obtaining excess VAT, the execution of intra-Community transactions which were not actually carried out;
tax subjects reported intra-community supplies in the context of carousel shops where there was a deliberate multiple decrease in the value of supplies in order to draw excess VAT deductions;
suppliers declared in their VAT returns and recapitulative statements the intra-Community supply of goods exempt from VAT to purchasers who were so-called "lost companies" and did not declare the tax on the goods acquired;
Suppliers made intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to taxable persons not registered for VAT in another Member State.
In such cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier's country;
Suppliers declared intra-community supplies in their VAT returns at a higher value than the intra-community acquisitions declared by the acquirers, and in some cases VAT was declared incorrectly.
The findings of the audit operation showed that the VIES system provides tax administrations with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-community transactions.
In particular, tax administrations should pay particular attention to the rigorous verification of differences between data reported by VAT payers and VIES data and the use of all information in tax procedures.
The issue of value added tax after the accession of the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the EU
Value added tax
On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became members of the EU.
Internal borders and border controls on the movement of goods within the EU have been abolished since EU accession.
Until 30.4.2004, the VAT administrator was the competent tax or tax office, with the exception of the import of goods and occasional bus transport in the Czech Republic, where the tax administrator was the customs office.
In connection with the adoption of the new Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Act No. 235/2004 Coll."), or Act No. 222/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Act No. 222/2004 Coll."), the administration of VAT on the acquisition of goods and services (formerly imports) from other EU member countries was transferred from the customs authorities to the tax or tax authorities.
The supply of goods in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of § 13 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. means the transfer of the right to dispose of goods as owner.
A supply of goods from the Czech Republic to another EU Member State is a supply of goods that have actually been shipped or transported to another EU Member State.
According to the provisions of § 64 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., this is an exempt taxable transaction with the right to deduct VAT if the goods are supplied to a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.
In the Slovak Republic, according to the provisions of § 8 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z., a supply of tangible property is considered to be a supply of goods where there is a change in the right of ownership.
A transfer of goods owned by a taxable person from the territory of the country to another Member State shall be regarded as a supply of goods if those goods are dispatched or transported by that person, or on his behalf, to another Member State for the purposes of his business.
Under Paragraph 43 of Law No 222/2004, the supply of goods from the national territory to another Member State is exempt from VAT if the person acquiring the goods is a person identified for VAT in another Member State.
Purchase of goods from another EU Member State in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of § 16 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. means acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of goods that are dispatched or transported to the acquirer by a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.
The Czech payer purchases goods at the price without VAT and is obliged to declare VAT in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of § 25 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., if he fulfils the conditions specified in § 73 of this Act, he is entitled to deduct VAT.
Purchase of goods in the territory of the country from another EU Member State in the Slovak Republic pursuant to the provisions of § 11 of Act No 222/2004 Coll. means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of movable tangible property dispatched or transported to the person acquiring the goods by or on behalf of the supplier or the person acquiring the goods to the territory of the country from another Member State.
Tax liability in the Slovak Republic is incurred by the payer when acquiring goods in the Czech Republic from another Member State in accordance with the provisions of § 20 of Act No 222/2004 Z.z.
The taxpayer may deduct VAT in accordance with the provisions of § 49 of Act No. 222/2004 Z. z. if the tax is applied by him on the acquisition of goods in the territory of another Member State in accordance with the provisions of §§ 11 and 11a of this Act.
In accordance with the provisions of § 17 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., or § 45 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., a trilateral transaction is a transaction concluded between three persons registered for VAT in three different EU Member States where the object of the transaction is the supply of the same goods between these three persons.
Intracommunal transactions are supplies and acquisitions of goods made between VAT payers from different EU Member States.
The total volumes of intra-community transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are shown in the following table.
VIES
In order to control the exercise of the right to VAT exemption in intra-Community supplies of goods, a VAT information exchange system has been set up within the EU.
It includes the VIES electronic system, which allows the tax authorities of the EU Member States to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt the taxable transaction from VAT and vice versa, whether the purchaser duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.
The VIES information system is not centralised within the EU.
Each Member State is developing its own VIES system.
National systems operate on a common principle and are interconnected through a common EU communication network, the so-called CCN (Common Communication Network; see diagram below).
In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was connected to an automated tax information system (hereinafter referred to as "ADIS"), in the Slovak Republic to the application software of the tax information system (hereinafter referred to as "APV DIS").
These systems are used by the financial and tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in the administration of taxes and duties.
International administrative cooperation
Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU country obtains information about tax entities that it would not be able to obtain on its own without such cooperation.
The main objective of international administrative cooperation is the fight against tax evasion and tax losses.
Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each Member State establishes, within an internal organisational structure, a central unit for administrative cooperation between EU Member States in the management of VAT, the so-called CLO (Central Liaison Office).
In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance – the Central Financial and Tax Directorate, where the Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (hereinafter referred to as “MF CLO”) has been established, performs tasks arising from international cooperation.
The function of the Customs Office in the Slovak Republic is fulfilled by the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic, Department of International Administrative Cooperation (hereinafter referred to as ‘DG CLO’).
These units inter alia communicate with EU foreign administrations in particular in the areas of information exchange within the VIES system, spontaneous information and information exchange at the request of EU tax administrations, coordination of multilateral (simultaneous) tax inspections, verification of VAT identification numbers of persons registered in other EU Member States and communicate with the European Commission.
In order to verify a particular intra-community transaction or to obtain additional information related to a particular tax entity, the tax authorities send requests for information to the EU via the Ministry of Customs or the Directorate of Customs.
Through these requests, they obtain information from the requested Member States which they can use to determine VAT correctly.
Requests for information are mostly sent electronically between the CLOs of the EU Member States, using a standardised SCAC form.
Selected audit findings when verifying commercial transactions
The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was focused mainly on the examination of selected intra-community transactions carried out between the two states and on the level of use of information obtained through international cooperation by financial and tax authorities.
The SAO of the Czech Republic required the SAO of the Slovak Republic to examine in 30 cases commercial transactions between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.
The SAO of Slovakia requested the SAO of the Czech Republic to examine in 10 cases commercial transactions between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.
Examination of intra-community transactions revealed, among other things:
o
The SAO of the Czech Republic asked the SAO of the Slovak Republic to verify the procedure of the tax administrator, who was sent a reply to the request for information.
The Slovak Tax Office, using the SCAC form, requested verification of the supply of goods (footwear) in the 3rd quarter of 2004 from a Slovak payer in the value of SKK 2,847,000.
The tax office in the Czech Republic replied that the Czech payer stated the acquisition of goods of this value only in the additional VAT declaration and the same goods were delivered back to Slovak tax entities in the value of CZK 2,550,000 by the end of 2004.
On the basis of the international cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR, it was found that the locally competent tax office granted the Slovak supplier a full right to excess VAT deduction arising, inter alia, from this supply.
This tax office did not provide information about the suspicion of re-export to the tax authorities of the locally competent buyers of goods imported back from the Czech payer.
This will trigger further investigation of commercial activities in relation to possible carousel fraud.
o
The Czech tax administrator asked through the SCAC form to verify the delivery of a technology line to Slovakia worth CZK 4,850,000 in the second quarter of 2004.
The tax proceedings carried out in Slovakia revealed that only part of the technology line was delivered, components worth CZK 3,395,000 were not delivered.
The SAO of Slovakia, when examining this case, found that the VAT on the taxable transaction was declared by a Slovak tax entity for the amount of CZK 4,850,000 in the VAT return (hereinafter "DAP") for the tax period 7/2004.
The SAO of the Czech Republic also found that the Czech payer reported an excess VAT deduction in the amount of CZK 655,000 in its VAT receipt for that quarter, which was created by the application of a VAT deduction from the purchase of this technology line from another domestic payer.
Based on the results of the investigation, the Czech Tax Office concluded that the Czech and Slovak taxpayer had created a business relationship for the purpose of unduly obtaining an excess VAT deduction, disputed the realisation of the taxable transaction and did not recognise part of the right to deduct the tax amounting to CZK 647,000.
o
In 2004, the Slovak tax administrator, using the SCAC form, requested verification of the supply of goods (copying machines) to the Czech payer in the amount of SKK 24 246 thousand made in December 2002.
These goods were purchased by a Slovak payer in November 2002 in Slovakia from another tax entity in the value of SKK 29 667 thousand and subsequently sold to a Czech payer.
The Slovak taxpayer applied an excess VAT deduction for the relevant tax period.
In a tax investigation carried out in the Czech Republic, it was found that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not file a DAP for the 4th quarter of 2002 or for the following period.
The SAO of Slovakia found that the Slovak tax administrator did not recognise the right to an excess deduction of CZK 5,541,000 based on the results of the tax audit. Sk invoked in the DAP for the month of 11/2002 and established a tax liability of SKK 1 750 000.
At the same time, that taxpayer was not granted an exemption from VAT in respect of the export of goods in December 2002.
o
The Czech tax administrator received an order from MF Customs to verify the value of the purchased goods for the 3rd quarter of 2004.
According to the VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods (paint thinner) from SR in the value of 3 767 thousand SKK.
This taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, did not file a DAP and was charged VAT in the amount of CZK 0 ex officio for the months 7 to 12/2004.
The Czech tax administrator asked through the SCAC form to verify whether deliveries of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic took place, in what quantity and price (according to invoices).
In reply, the Slovak Tax Office sent a copy of the invoice, the bill of lading and a request for payment of the invoice.
The SAO of Slovakia found that the Slovak payer was granted an exemption with the right to deduct VAT on this supply.
The SAO of the Czech Republic found that the Czech tax administrator assessed the response to the request for information received from the Slovak Republic as evidence that the company had purchased goods from another EU Member State.
On the basis of further investigation, the tax office in the Czech Republic will ask the superior authority to review the tax liability.
o
The Slovak company supplied goods (particle board products) to, among others, an American company which deposited these goods in the Czech Republic in a free customs zone.
The operator of that free zone was named on the invoices as the consignee of the goods.
In 2004, for example, a US company purchased from a Slovak payer particle board tiles worth USD 57 600 (at a unit price of USD 100 per piece), which it placed in a free customs zone.
Subsequently, the company transferred ownership of the goods to a Swiss company, amounting to USD 14 400 (unit price of USD 25 each) and the goods were re-exported to the Slovak Republic.
The goods were not unloaded in the Czech Republic, but left the area of the free customs zone on the same means of transport.
The Slovak tax administrator initiated tax inspections of individual tax periods of 2004 and 2005 at the supplier of goods on suspicion of carousel transactions.
The verification of the underlying transactions was requested from the Czech locally competent tax authorities using several SCAC forms.
Individual responses gradually created an image of the shops and confirmed the involvement of stakeholders from the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the carousel shops.
The SAO of the Czech Republic in cooperation with the SAO of the Slovak Republic found that in these business relations there was a deliberate multiple decrease in the value of goods.
On the basis of the information received, the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic concluded that the carousel trade in question is free price formation (i.e. the import of undervalued goods and their overvaluation by domestic companies in the chain between the importer and the exporter) which is not in breach of the VAT Act.
Under the current legislation, the payment of excess VAT to export companies cannot be prevented as they fulfil all the conditions of the law to exempt supplies from VAT.
o
The Czech payer's VAT registration was cancelled on 12 July 2005.
On 27 October 2005, this entity became a taxpayer again on the basis of a voluntarily submitted application for VAT registration.
The Czech taxpayer entered into the DAP for the month of 8/2005 (i.e. the period when he was not a VAT payer) the value of the acquisition of goods (printing press) from the Slovak Republic in the amount of CZK 1,174,000 and claimed the right to deduct VAT.
This value corresponded to a supply of goods from a Slovak payer in the amount of SKK 1,530,000, which the Slovak payer listed in the DAP as a supply of goods to another EU Member State with the right to deduct VAT.
The Slovak tax administrator requested to verify this supply using the SCAC form, because the Slovak supplier did not prove how he acquired the goods delivered to the Czech Republic.
The SAO of the Czech Republic found that the Czech payer does not cooperate with the tax administrator and does not reside at the address specified in the Commercial Register.
As part of the international exchange of information, a local investigation will be carried out in the Czech Republic by the local tax administrator in order to verify the data.
o
The Slovak payer included in the recapitulative statement for the 3rd quarter of 2004 the delivery of goods in the value of CZK 956,000. To a tax entity from the Czech Republic.
The VAT number of the Czech entity was marked as incorrect by the VIES system.
A verification in the database of payers revealed that such a TIN was never assigned in the Czech Republic.
According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was the execution of electrical assembly works on real estate in the Czech Republic, it was not the delivery of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, but the provision of services.
The services were invoiced without VAT, as the Czech entity informed the Slovak entity that it is registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic.
The Slovak tax authority requested to verify these facts using the SCAC form.
The SAO of the Czech Republic inquired at the local tax authority in the Czech Republic and found that the tax entity listed on the invoices as a customer was never registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic, did not declare the tax on received services from the Slovak entity and did not declare the tax on the acquisition of goods.
Neither a local investigation nor a tax inspection was carried out on the Czech entity, its current whereabouts are unknown.
On the basis of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator learned that the Czech tax entity became a VAT payer by law by accepting the service.
The Slovak tax entity will be audited for the first to fourth quarters of 2004.
o
The Slovak payer included in the recapitulative statement for the 3rd quarter of 2004 the delivery of goods in the value of CZK 1,055,000. To the Czech payer.
According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was the execution of electrical assembly works on real estate in the Czech Republic.
It was not a matter of delivering goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, but of providing services.
The Slovak tax authority requested to verify these facts using the SCAC form.
The SAO of the Czech Republic inquired with the local tax authority in the Czech Republic that the Czech entity was a VAT payer at the time of the delivery and a local investigation was carried out to verify the acquisition of goods from other EU Member States in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
On the basis of this on-the-spot investigation, it was found that this case was not really a purchase of goods, but a purchase of services, which was also declared by the Czech entity in the regular DAP.
The tax office also found that the Czech entity did not pay the correct amount of VAT for the tax period of the 3rd quarter of 2004 as a result of a bad procedure in the calculation of VAT.
The taxpayer shall submit an additional DAP.
The SAO, when questioned by the local tax office, found that the Slovak payer had misstated the provision of the service in the recapitulative statement and would be subject to a tax audit for the first to fourth quarters of 2004.
o
The Czech tax entity has voluntarily registered as a VAT payer since 10 March 2004.
For the first quarter of 2004, it filed a DAP with a high turnover in both input and output.
The local tax administrator initiated tax proceedings, the entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator, therefore due to the suspicion of involvement in the carousel business he was assessed VAT in the amount of CZK 0.
No further DAP has been filed by this payer.
As a result of his failure to comply with his legal obligations, his VAT registration was cancelled on 4.1.2005.
According to data from the VIES system, this entity should have purchased goods in the value of SKK 7,846,000 from the Slovak payer in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2004.
In order to verify the execution of these transactions, the Czech tax administrator sent two requests for information to SR.
The SAO inquired at the local tax office and found that the managing director of the Czech company denied the execution of the audited transactions and questioned the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.
The intra-community supply to the Czech Republic declared by the Slovak payer was questioned on the basis of the tax procedure carried out in Slovakia.
The payer will not be entitled to VAT exemption and will be charged VAT on the above amount.
o
According to the VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods (working clothes) from the Slovak Republic in the first quarter of 2005 with a total value of SKK 39,970,000.
This quarter, the Czech payer reported the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State only in the DAP for the month of 3/2005, in the value of CZK 11,292,000.
The locally competent tax authority carried out a local investigation of the entity in order to verify the data in this DAP.
As the company did not submit any documents or otherwise substantiate the implementation of taxable transactions, the tax administrator charged it VAT of CZK 0 on 9 June 2005.
In view of the doubts about the acquisition of the goods, the tax authority sent two requests for information to the Slovak Republic in May 2005.
According to the reply to the requests for information, the tax administrator in the Slovak Republic had doubts about the realisation of the business cases as well as about the realisation of the payment.
The SAO of Slovakia was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent a suggestion to the Czech Customs Agency to conduct simultaneous audits with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out at the participating entities.
At the time of the coordinated inspection in the Czech Republic, the locally competent tax administrator carried out further investigations concerning the Czech subject and at the same time an investigation by the Police of the Czech Republic was being carried out.
o
The following 2 cases concern companies suspected of being involved in carousel fraud.
Transactions in goods (work clothes) were carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.
Slovak payer No. 1 supplied goods to Czech payer No. 2.
In the Czech Republic, the goods were then sold to payer No. 3, who delivered them back to SR payer No. 4 (see diagram No. 2).
(a)
Czech payer No. 2 should have purchased goods (work clothes) worth CZK 4,847,000 from Slovak payer No. 1 in the 4th quarter of 2004 and goods worth CZK 17,050,000 in the 1st quarter of 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the DAP did not correspond to the data in the VIES system, the locally competent tax administrator sent a request for information to the Slovak Republic on 25 May 2005.
In reply, the Slovak tax administrator expressed doubts about the realisation of the business cases as well as the realisation of the payment.
On June 8, 2005, a request for information was received at the Ministry of Customs of the Slovak Republic concerning goods worth SKK 16,575,000, which were to be delivered in December 2004 by the Slovak payer No. 1 to the Czech payer No. 2.
The Slovak side requested to verify whether the Czech payer 2 actually received the goods, declared them in the DAP and paid the VAT.
The official record drawn up by the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic shows that the Czech payer no. 2 has not been residing at an address registered in the Commercial Register for some time.
Although he was a VAT payer with a monthly tax period, he filed a DAP for a quarterly tax period.
In view of this, the Czech tax authority was unable to assess the VAT.
Taxable transaction between Slovak payer No. 1 and Czech payer No. 2 mentioned in the application in the amount of CZK 16,575,000. This could not be verified in the light of the above.
The Czech tax authority suspected the involvement of both entities in the carousel trade in order to draw an excess VAT deduction.
(B)
Czech payer No. 3, dealing with the purchase and sale of passenger cars, filed a DAP for the tax period of months 1 and 2/2005, in which he declared the delivery of goods (work clothes) to Slovak payer No. 4 in a total value of CZK 21,935 thousand.
These work clothes should have been purchased by the Czech payer No 3 from the Czech payer No 2 between December 2004 and January 2005.
The locally competent tax office sent a request for information to the Slovak Republic, the main purpose of which was to verify whether the Slovak payer No. 4 purchased goods worth CZK 1,025,000 from the Czech payer No. 3 in December 2004 and CZK 21,935,000 in the first quarter of 2005.
The reply to this request for information received from SR showed that in the DAP for the month of 12/2004, the Slovak payer No 4 indicated a zero value for the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in the DAP for the months 1 and 2/2005 indicated a value for the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State of only SKK 1 193.
The Slovak payer No 4 did not respond to the invitation to submit tax documents for the tax period of 10/2004 to 3/2005.
A local investigation carried out in SR revealed that the company was not at the address indicated in the Commercial Register.
The reply further stated that this payer fulfils all the characteristics of a so-called "lost company" and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.
The SAO of Slovakia was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent a suggestion to the Czech Tax Office to conduct simultaneous audits with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out at the participating tax entities.
During the coordinated inspection, the Czech tax administrator collected documents that would confirm or refute the existence of the goods.
VAT will be calculated according to the outcome of the investigation.
The case is also being handled by the Czech Police.
Progress of control action
As part of the preparation of parallel audits, a coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO of the Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO of the Slovak Republic took place in the first half of July 2005.
The participants of this meeting took note of the VAT legislation in both countries and the integration of the VIES electronic system into the national databases.
The outcome of the meeting was to specify the scope of cooperation and to establish the conditions for the selection of control samples.
The two parties agreed that the cooperation will focus on the following areas: (b) verification of data on intra-community acquisitions listed in the DAP by payers in the Czech Republic using information from the summary reports (hereinafter referred to as “SH”) of payers from the Slovak Republic contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; (c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic on executed business transactions.
Furthermore, it was agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out in relation to the volume of intra-community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and Slovakia using the SCAC form.
5.1 Intracommunitary transactions
The procedure of information processing by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia for intra-Community delivery and acquisition of goods is illustrated in the following diagram.
5.1.1 Intracommunitary delivery
If the VAT payer makes an intra-community delivery, he is obliged to submit SH by the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.
The payer in the Czech Republic provides in the SH summary information on his/her deliveries of goods to another EU Member State exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.
The payer in SR is obliged to enter in the SH the value of goods that were tax exempt and delivered from the territory of the country to other EU Member States for the period of the calendar quarter.
Data on the value of the goods supplied are always given in the SH in Czech or Slovak currency, broken down by individual tax entities with an indication of their VAT number under which they were registered in their country.
Data on services shall not be included in the SH.
If the payer in the Czech Republic finds out that he has given incorrect data in the SH, he is obliged to file a subsequent SH.
If the payer in SR finds that the data given in the SH were incomplete or incorrect, he shall file a corrective SH before the deadline for filing the SH, after the expiry of this deadline he shall file an additional SH.
The VIES system allows the exchange of information on VAT registered payers' registration data in EU Member States.
Tax payers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia can verify whether the VAT number of the relevant acquirer is registered in the EU Member State.
The data from the submitted SH are grouped into MF CLO or DR CLO by the VIES system according to the individual VAT number of the acquirer.
The aggregate value of all deliveries for each VAT number of the acquirer and the code of the method of filling from all its Czech and Slovak suppliers, the so-called L1QD files, are created.
Data from files L1QDs shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.
The total value of intra-community transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia (from the L1QD files) is given in the following table.
If the VIES in another Member State detects erroneous acquirer's TIN in the L1QD files sent, it generates an O_MCTL message containing all the erroneous TIN numbers indicating the type of error.
This report is then sent to the MF CLO, or to the CDC CLO.
The O_MCTL message can contain 4 types of errors: formally incorrect VAT number, the VAT number is not registered in the country or has never been allocated, the acquirer with a specific VAT number was not a VAT payer in the given quarter, the registration for the VAT of the acquirer was terminated during the quarter.
In the Czech Republic, MF CLO transmits data from received O_MCTL reports to financial authorities.
If the incorrect VAT number of an EU payer is used in any of the sent lines of the SH or subsequent SH, the so-called "VAT ID Doubt Notice" is generated at the relevant tax office by the ADIS system.
The tax office checks whether delivery to a VAT registered payer in another EU Member State has actually taken place and records the result of the verification in the system.
In SR, DR CLO processes all O_MCTL messages in the VIES system and sends them electronically to the local tax authorities together with the identification of the tax payers who have reported an incorrect VAT number in their SH.
Subsequently, the tax authorities invite the payer to submit an additional SH and the indication of valid VAT numbers, respectively the tax office will check the delivery of goods with the relevant payer when declaring an invalid VAT number in the submitted SH.
Data on the number of erroneous TINs related to intra-community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are given in the following table.
Of the total number of 41,728 VAT numbers of Czech payers listed in the Slovak Payers' Tax Register in the period from the 2nd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005, 929 were erroneous VAT numbers, i.e. 2.23%.
Of the total number of 62 997 VAT numbers of Slovak payers listed in the Czech payers' tax return during the same period, 416 were incorrect VAT numbers, i.e. 0.66%.
When reporting intra-community transactions made between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Czech VAT payers reported on average fewer erroneous VAT numbers in their SH than Slovak VAT payers.
During the examination of the activities of the financial and tax authorities, it was found that the VIES system did not in all cases provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of tax entities.
E.g.:
- although the VIES system confirmed the validity of the tax entity's registration in the 4th quarter of 2004 on the request of the tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the O_MCTL report was subsequently generated due to the termination of the payer's registration in this quarter.
The investigation revealed that the termination of the registration took place only on 1.1.2005.
- The SAO of the Slovak Republic also found that 6 tax entities filed tax returns with the wrong tax exempt number, but the O_MCTL reports did not contain this tax exempt number.
In SR, the submitted SHs are converted into electronic form at the tax offices and the data from them are sent to the DG CLO.
Following the subsequent processing of these data in the VIES system, the DCI sends to the relevant tax authorities the so-called breakdowns of errors in the SH submitted by the tax entities for the relevant quarters.
The SAO of Slovakia compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH as of 26 July 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the audit) and as of 2 February 2006 (i.e. data processed after the completion of the audit).
The following table provides a comparison of the data.
From the above data it can be seen that the SAO SR audit had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with an incorrect VAT number (on average by 199 SH per quarter) but also on the reduction of the number of uncorrected errors in SH (on average by 431 errors per quarter).
In the Czech Republic, the value of intra-community deliveries indicated by the payer in the respective DAP rows is compared with the value of intra-community deliveries indicated by the payer in the quarterly SH.
The ADIS system automatically indicates the differences between these values.
The tax administrator should examine the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the data collected to determine the tax liability.
The SAO of the Czech Republic found that the audited financial authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.
The total difference between the values given in SH and DAP in these cases amounted to CZK 537,231,000.
From the 3rd quarter of 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values given in SH and DAP up to 0.5% of the total value of intra-community deliveries according to SH as a match and to set it in the ADIS system.
For payers with a large volume of intra-community deliveries per quarter, 0.5% of the value represents a non-negligible amount, so tax administrators should not set the SH and DAP compliance in these cases without explaining the causes of the differences.
For example, the tax administrator set the match without verification in the case of a value difference of CZK 1,561,000.
The verification of differences in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was complicated by the fact that SH for each calendar quarter was submitted by payers within 25 days after the end of this quarter.
Tax administrators could not compare the values of intra-community supplies listed in these DAPs with SH values for taxpayers with a monthly tax period at the time of submission of DAPs for the first two months of the calendar quarter.
In these cases, the tax authorities became aware of any discrepancy between the DAP and SH data only at the time when the tax liability or excess VAT was assessed or refunded.
5.1.2 Intracommunal acquisition
The VIES system provides, inter alia, information on the values of intra-Community transactions carried out within EU Member States.
Purchase of goods in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the delivered data from SH filed by payers from other EU Member States (L1QD delivered) are processed by MF CLO.
During processing, the data are converted at the minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared with the acquisition value indicated by the Czech payers in the DAP for the relevant quarter.
The value of the acquisition of goods reported by the payers in DAP should be in the range of the minimum and maximum converted value L1QD (values L1min and L1max).
If the value reported in the DAP is less than L1min, a so-called authentication order is generated for the payer with the most significant irregularities.
Orders to verify the acquisition of goods alert problematic tax entities and are transmitted to the locally competent tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.
The number of verification orders concerning audited financial offices in the Czech Republic is shown in the following table.
The SAO of the Czech Republic found that in 33 cases the audited tax authorities did not check for irregularities in the values of intra-community acquisitions, which were indicated by the received verification orders.
The total difference between the values given in the SH of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers in these cases amounted to at least CZK 148,319,000.
The SAO of the Czech Republic selected 533 files of tax entities for auditing, for which audited tax authorities received a verification order from the Ministry of Customs.
The audit found the following most common causes of differences between the values stated in the DAP of the acquirer and in the SH of the supplier: on the side of the acquirer (Czech payer) in 263 cases the acquirer did not declare the acquisition of goods in the regular DAP, in 93 cases the payer declared the acquisition of goods in a tax period other than that in which it was obliged to declare the tax, in 6 cases the acquirer entered the value of the acquired goods in the incorrect DAP line, on the side of the supplier (EU payer) in 88 cases the payer included the values in their SHSH in other cases included in the value of goods in the CR in 16 cases.
On the side of Slovak payers, the most frequent erroneous inclusion of the value of the services provided in the SH.
54 such cases were identified at the audited financial offices.
For example, during the investigation of the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10,974,000 arose from the fact that the Slovak payer introduced into the SH for the first quarter of 2005 the provision of services (construction works and supplies of goods including assembly in the Czech Republic).
Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of received advances in the SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers reported in the SH received advances from Czech payers, as a result of which an order was generated to verify the difference in the amount of CZK 3,580,000.
Orders to verify goods acquired are generated only once per quarter.
In cases where there is subsequently a change in the SH data in the EU Member States, such as a change in the buyer of goods in the Czech Republic or an increased value of the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new verification orders are not generated.
Since the VIES system does not automatically draw attention to these changes, the locally competent tax authority of the person acquiring the goods may not be aware, without any other initiative, of the facts relevant to the correct determination of the tax liability on the goods acquired, and there is a strong likelihood of VAT evasion.
The audit of the SAO of the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:
The Slovak payer stated in the SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004 the value of the delivery of goods for the Czech payer in the amount of 1 504 thousand SKK.
On 1 February 2005, the Tax Office of the Czech payer sent a request for information to the Slovak Republic, as the Czech payer declared the acquisition of goods only in the amount of CZK 425,000.
On the basis of the tax procedure, the Slovak payer filed an additional SH on 1 March 2005 in which he corrected the data on the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic by reducing the value of the supply for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538 thousand. Sk and increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from the amount of CZK 194,000. Sk to the value of 1 160 thousand. Sk.
Four Slovak payers reported in their SH for the second quarter of 2004 intra-community delivery to payers from the Czech Republic in the total amount of 10,240 thousand SKK (i.e. 8,183 thousand CZK).
However, Czech acquirers did not report intra-community acquisition in the DAP.
Based on the international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were in all cases delivered to another Czech payer, which was not mentioned in the SH filed by Slovak payers.
During the first quarter of 2005, Slovak payers increased the value of intra-community deliveries for this Czech payer by a total of SKK 10,240 thousand in the additional SH relating to the second quarter of 2004.
In view of the above, the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic could not doubt the accuracy of the data in the submitted DAP for the second quarter of 2004, even if the actual acquirer did not comply with the obligation to declare intra-community acquisitions for this quarter.
The SAO of the Czech Republic found that on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the aforementioned Czech payer was additionally assessed for VAT in the amount of CZK 3,640,000 for tax periods 5 and 6/2004 and in the amount of CZK 3,305,000 for goods acquired in these periods for the third quarter of 2004.
It can be seen from the above that tax administrations had to examine in tax proceedings not only differences arising from errors in the acquirer's DAP, but also differences due to different reporting of intra-Community supply and acquisition data in different EU Member States.
Unifying the conditions for reporting such data would lead to more effective control activities of tax administrations.
Purchase of goods in SR
In SR, the APV DIS system allows comparing the data on the value of acquired goods obtained through the VIES system from other EU Member States with the data provided in the DAP of Slovak acquirers.
The method by which the data are compared is called the ‘MIN-MAX method’.
Using this method, the values of deliveries listed in the HS of payers from other EU Member States are converted at the minimum and maximum exchange rates for the relevant quarter.
The MIN-MAX interval is created, which is used for comparison with the values of acquisitions of goods listed in the DAP of Slovak payers.
DG CLO will send the tax authorities information on the values of intra-community acquisitions listed in the DAP and the values of EU supplies in the VIES system.
The tax administrator decides which VAT registered persons will be checked for the difference, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.
Based on the data provided by the SAO, the SAO selected 57 files of Slovak acquirers of goods from audited tax offices, of which 25 payers acquired goods from the Czech Republic, where the highest differences were found between the acquisition values obtained from the VIES system and the values declared in the DAP.
The audit performed by the SAO of Slovakia confirmed that the tax administrators did not thoroughly check the differences obtained by the MIN-MAX method and thus did not check the accuracy of the data stated in the DAP of Slovak acquirers.
As part of the audit, the SAO asked tax authorities to conduct 47 local investigations of specific tax entities.
During the audit of the SAO SR at the tax offices, 31 local investigations were completed.
For Slovak companies, for which the VIES system showed significant differences in MIN-MAX values when acquiring goods from EU Member States, the following facts were found, among others:
In the DAP for the 4th quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer did not provide the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.
The Tax Office found that a company from the Czech Republic mistakenly reported the VAT number of this payer in the SH for the 4th quarter of 2004, while goods worth CZK 19,184,000 were actually delivered to another Slovak payer.
According to the VIES system, in the 4th quarter of 2004 the Slovak company was to purchase goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria with a value of MIN 682 692 thousand Sk and MAX 715 105 thousand Sk.
This company filed DAP for the periods in which it stated the value of acquisitions of goods from the EU at only SKK 480 599 thousand.
The tax administrator carried out a local investigation and found that the taxpayer purchased electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.
Suppliers to SH and DAP did not specify intra-community deliveries by invoice date, but by delivery date.
Due to other irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU countries, the tax administrator will request verification of the value of the supplied goods through SCAC forms.
The acquisition of goods from EU member countries in the 4th quarter of 2004 was not mentioned by the Slovak payer in the DAP.
According to the VIES system, this payer should have purchased goods worth MIN 11 286 thousand and MAX 11 845 thousand.
The Tax Office carried out a local investigation, which revealed that the tax entity had not purchased any goods from EU Member States in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The SAO recommended that the tax office ask for verification of supplies of goods from EU member countries using the SCAC form.
In the VIES system, the supply of goods to a Slovak customer was reported in the value of MIN 557 thousand SKK and MAX 565 thousand SKK.
In the DAP for the tax period 10 to 12/2004, the payer did not declare any acquisition of goods.
A local investigation by the tax administrator found that the tax entity received an invoice from a supplier from the Czech Republic for materials consumed during the repair of the hydraulic loader on 10 December 2004.
The SAO recommended a tax audit of the payer.
During the audit of the SAO SR in 16 cases the tax authorities did not terminate the local investigations.
In 10 cases, the SAO asked tax administrators to perform tax audits on tax entities.
Reports on the results of local investigations and tax audits will be submitted by the tax authorities after their implementation to the SAO of Slovakia.
Examples include:
The Slovak acquirer did not mention in the DAP for the 4th quarter of 2004 the acquisition of goods from EU member countries and for the tax period 10 to 12/2004 he declared no tax and claimed a refund of excess VAT in the total amount of SKK 1 236 thousand.
The tax administrator conducted a local investigation, which showed that the tax entity purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth EUR 683,000 (approx. SKK 27,080,000).
The goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to the customs office in Čiernej nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.
The Slovak payer issued an invoice for the amount of EUR 683 thousand for the customer in the Russian Federation, which was not mentioned in the submitted DAP.
The tax administrator carries out a tax audit of the tax entity.
The difference between the acquisition data reported in the Slovak payer's DAP for the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005 and the data on deliveries reported by payers from the EU Member States in each quarter totalled SKK 4,800 thousand.
The tax office found that the taxpayer purchased goods from suppliers in the Czech Republic and Belgium and subsequently sold these goods to Ukraine.
The invoices were accompanied by the single export declaration.
The acquisition of goods in the DAP was not mentioned by the tax entity, according to the statement of the company's manager, the goods were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine under the transit procedure.
The taxpayer did not submit any VAT records in the on-the-spot investigation.
A tax audit has been initiated on the payer.
5.2 International L3 Information Exchange
The exchange of information at L3 level is initiated by the locally competent tax administrators, who send their requests for information (hereinafter referred to as the “GI”) or spontaneous information (hereinafter referred to as the “SPI”) relating to a particular tax entity or transaction through the Ministry of Customs or the Ministry of Finance, respectively.
DG CLO to another EU Member State. The aim of the ŽOI is, for example, to prove the execution of the given transaction within the framework of intra-community transactions, to verify a specific VAT number, etc.
In the case of SPI, this is the communication of information relevant to a tax authority in another EU Member State.
Cooperation in the field of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The maximum time limit for replying to the EIT was set at 3 months in Article 8 of that regulation.
The conditions for the admissibility of applications are governed by the Decision of the Commission of the European Communities of 15.11.2004, which stipulates that, unless the participating States agree otherwise, the GI must relate to commercial transactions of at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.
If the GI concerns a commercial transaction with a value of less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may refuse to reply in view of its workload.
The following diagram illustrates the procedure of handling incoming RUs by the tax administration of the Czech Republic, including the internal time limits set for processing at each organizational level.
In SR, the time limit for the discharge of the GI by the tax authorities was set at 2 months in order to comply with the three-month deadline under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
From 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005, MF CLO received a total of 29 GIs and 3 SPIs from the Slovak Republic.
Of the 29 GIs received, 26 (i.e. 89.7%) were discharged within the prescribed period of 3 months and 3 (i.e. 10.3%) were discharged after that period.
In the same period, DG CLO from the Czech Republic received a total of 71 RUs and 7 SPIs.
Of the 71 GIs received, 64 (i.e. 90.1%) were processed within the prescribed period of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7.0%) were processed after this period (for the remaining 2 cases it was not possible to determine the period of execution from the submitted materials).
The following chart contains more detailed data on the processing time of RUIs received by MF CLO, respectively DR CLO.
The following table contains the reasons for sending the RU, as stated on the SCAC forms.
Conclusion
Compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT, as well as the use of the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU Member States, in particular for checking the application of the VAT exemption, was examined on the basis of international cooperation.
International cooperation has made it possible to examine selected intra-community transactions between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
An examination of the selected transactions revealed that, on the basis of an international exchange of information, the tax administrations of both countries had uncovered cases of companies carrying out fictitious intra-community business transactions in order to obtain excess VAT deductions, as well as cases where the purchasers did not declare the correct amount of VAT on the received supplies of goods.
The audit also found differences in the processing and use of VIES data by the tax administrations of both countries.
The audit also pointed to problems caused by different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions of goods in different EU Member States.
Unifying the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would make the control activities of the tax administrations of the Member States more effective.
An examination of the procedure of the tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of the VIES system revealed that the tax authorities did not make sufficient use of all the possibilities of the VIES system and the relevant legal authorisations.
Furthermore, it was found that the VIES system did not in all cases provide up-to-date information on the supply of goods and on the validity of the VAT registration of tax entities.
The SAO SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH, processed before the start of the audit, with the data processed after the completion of the audit.
Comparison of these data showed that the audit of the SAO SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with erroneously reported DINs, but also on the reduction of the number of uncorrected errors in SH.
In case of discrepancies in the reported data, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out local investigations or tax inspections.
The SAO of the Czech Republic did not have such an option under the applicable legislation in the Czech Republic.
The findings of the audit work showed that the VIES system provided tax administrations with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-community transactions.
Given that there remains scope for tax evasion in this area, increased attention needs to be paid to intra-community transactions in the VAT administration.
Communiqué
This report was drawn up in the Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic.
Parallel control of the administration of value added tax and excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Opening Word
This information document gives an overview of the progress and results of the parallel audits carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the area of value added tax and excise tax administration.
The cooperation between the SAIs of both countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement on control activities concluded in February 2004.
The theme of the parallel control actions was chosen in view of the fact that indirect taxes contribute significantly to the revenues of the national budgets of both countries.
The construction of value added tax, allowing the refund of excess deductions, provides scope for tax fraud or evasion.
High rates of excise duties, especially on tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, mean high profits for those who escape taxation by illegally selling these goods.
Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.
In view of the need to address this issue comprehensively throughout the European Union, the VAT Working Group has been created by the supreme audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union, in which the supreme audit institutions of both countries are actively involved.
The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but especially in the joint effort to identify problem areas of indirect tax administration in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion.
The experience and knowledge gained will be used in the framework of the planned controls of indirect taxes, aimed in particular at the involvement of the tax authorities of both states in the VIES system, which makes it possible to control the movement of goods between the Member States of the European Union.
Report on the results of the audit of the administration of value added tax and excise duties for the years 2002 and 2003
1. Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004
Object of control:
(CZ) Value added tax and excise duties
(SK) Control of the procedure of the tax administrator in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and excise duties
On 11 February 2004, the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) of the Slovak Republic (SAO SR) were signed. The object of the contract was cooperation in parallel audits "Value Added Tax and Excise Tax", included in the Audit Plan of the SAO for 2004 under No. 04/07 and "Audit of the Tax Administrators' Procedure for Administration, Control and Enforcement of Value Added Tax and Excise Taxes", included in the Audit Plan of the SAO SR under No. 18/2004.
The cooperation consisted in exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract concluded and in drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.
In the contract, both parties undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the customs administration database and from tax entity files kept by the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and the tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the contracting parties could not obtain when checking the application of value added tax and excise duties on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the respective state.
The checks were carried out in parallel between January and August 2004.
In the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the Czech Republic"), the audit was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of South Bohemia, North-East Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited bodies were the General Directorate of Customs and 12 selected financial offices: the Financial Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 3, the Financial Office in České Budějovice, the Financial Office in Frýdek-Místek, the Financial Office in Hodonín, the Financial Office in Jihlava, the Financial Office in Kostelec nad Orlicí, the Financial Office in Kroměříž, the Financial Office in Písek, the Financial Office in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, the Financial Office in Ústí nad Orlicí, the Financial Office in Velký Meziříčí.
The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "SR") was carried out by the Tax and Customs Administration Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with the SAO Expoziturami SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 10 selected tax offices:
Tax Office Bratislava for selected tax entities, Tax Office Bratislava III, Tax Office Trnava, Tax Office Pooh-chov, Tax Office Banská Bystrica I, Tax Office Liptovský Mikuláš, Tax Office Žilina I, Tax Office Žilina II, Tax Office Košice I and Tax Office Košice IV.
Objective of control
The aim of the audits was to verify the fulfilment of the duties of the tax and tax authorities and customs authorities in the administration of value added tax and excise duties with a focus on the collection of these taxes on imports and exports of goods and services.
The aim of the international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic and their subsequent verification in tax returns at the relevant financial and tax offices.
The audited period covered the years 2002 and 2003.
2. Recapitulation of control results
2.1. General evaluation of control activities
Within the framework of international cooperation, the SAO provided 22,206 items of the Single Customs Declarations (hereinafter referred to as "JCD") on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia from the Czech Customs Database and the SAO provided the SAO with 30,221 items of the JCD from the SR Customs Database.
Comparison of selected JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic was performed.
Out of 5,883 selected JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic, a total of 43% of the related JCD items were assigned.
Out of the 12 343 selected JCD items from the SR Customs Database, a total of 26 % of the related JCD items were allocated.
On the basis of the unassigned JCD items, the tax authorities selected files of tax entities, whose reported imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Based on the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia and the financial and tax authorities, the realization of reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified on the territory of the second state.
The SAO and the SAO of Slovakia conducted a joint pilot inspection at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma, during which both parties cooperated closely in verifying the accuracy of the data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
The audit did not find any deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods carried out in 2002.
International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions between trading partners from both countries and has highlighted shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.
2.2. Summary of control results
In the area of international cooperation, the SAO and the SAO scrutinized imports and exports of alcohol and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their parts, as well as other goods.
The SAO requested verification of the realisation of exports of goods declared for 40 JCD with a total statistical value of CZK 15,301,093 and the SAO requested verification of exports with a statistical value of CZK 56,989.
The SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic found, among other things, the following facts:
- commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic,
- errors in entering data into customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports,
- for some exports from the Czech Republic, the corresponding imports to the Slovak Republic have not been demonstrated.
In such cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of improper application of value added tax deductions.
- tax subjects did not fulfil certain statutory obligations when reporting imports and exports in value added tax returns;
- shortcomings have been identified in the activities of the tax or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax and excise duties and in their interaction with customs authorities.
In the area of value added tax and excise duties, attention to international trade will continue to be needed in order to effectively minimise tax evasion.
In particular, it is important to improve the quality of the work of tax administrators in the administration of value added tax.
Effective control of excise duties is based on control of document circulation, systematic physical control of goods and mutual exchange of information on import and export of goods.
3. Description of the situation regarding value added tax and excise duties
Value added tax
Value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") was levied by the tax or tax authorities on taxable transactions carried out within the territory of the country and by the customs authorities on importation of goods.
The tax revenue was determined by the tax authorities by the difference between the collected own tax liability and the refunded excess VAT deductions.
VAT revenue at customs offices was determined by the amount of tax collected by them.
In accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, the tax collected by the customs authorities was reflected in the tax deductions applied at the tax or tax authorities.
For most tax and tax authorities, excess VAT deductions exceeded tax liability.
VAT is one of the key taxes in terms of state budget revenues, as it accounted for about 31% of the tax revenues of the state budget of the Czech Republic and about 42% of the tax revenues of the state budget of the Slovak Republic in 2003.
Total VAT collection in the Czech Republic amounted to CZK 162.9 billion in 2003.
The tax and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions returned totalled CZK 231.4 billion.
Total VAT collection in Slovakia amounted to SKK 83.8 billion in 2003.
The tax and customs authorities collected 187.0 billion SKK in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions returned totalled 103.2 billion SKK.
Excise duties
The collection of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as the ‘SPD’) was carried out by the competent tax and tax authorities and, when importing products subject to the SPD, by the customs authorities.
SpD's share of the tax revenue of the state budget in the Czech Republic amounted to approximately 16% in 2003 and approximately 19% in the Slovak Republic.
The total collection of State Treasury funds collected in the Czech Republic by financial and customs authorities in 2003 amounted to CZK 85.6 billion and in the Slovak Republic amounted to SKK 38.0 billion.
4. Progress of control action
The cooperation between the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic took place in two stages.
In the first stage, the comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was carried out; in the second stage, the results of this comparison were used for mutual verification of the implementation of selected trade transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and for inspections carried out on the territory of both countries.
4.1.
Preparation of control action
The first proposal for cooperation in parallel VAT and VAT audits was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic in April 2003.
In November 2003, a coordination meeting was held at which, among other things, the selection of commodities - goods which presented a significant risk in complying with customs and tax rules: - alcohol and spirits, tariff lines Nos 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, tariff lines Nos 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, tariff lines Nos 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile telephones and their accessories, tariff lines Nos 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.
The two parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out: a) from unallocated items found by comparing exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, b) from entities carrying out imports and exports regularly or in one lump sum in a large volume, c) based on findings from inspections carried out by selected financial and tax authorities.
4.2. Comparison of customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia
In the first stage, a mechanism of mutual assignment of JCD items registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was tested on a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002.
Subsequently, a part of exports from the Czech Republic was compared with imports to the Slovak Republic in 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:
- 2207 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol or higher; ethyl alcohol and other spirits, denatured, of any strength,
- 2208 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol; spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages,
- 2401 Unmanufactured tobacco; tobacco waste,
- 2402 Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes, of tobacco or of tobacco substitutes,
- 2403 Other manufactured tobacco and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and essences;
- 8525 20 91 Transmission apparatus containing reception equipment: For cellular network (mobile phones),
- 8525 20 99 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception apparatus:
- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with the apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.
Other: Parts of apparatus falling in subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.
JCD items from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia were mutually assigned based on the agreement of the individual paragraphs of the JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration number of the vehicle transporting the load, date of crossing the national border, tariff item, etc.).
The results of the comparison are shown in the following tables and graphs.
The cross-referencing of individual imports and exports was hampered, inter alia, by the fact that commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides.
For example, exports from the Czech Republic declared on one export JCD were declared on the territory of the Slovak Republic on multiple import JCDs, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.
Other factors that affected the success of the referencing were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as the time shift between the registration of exports in the customs database of one country and the registration of corresponding imports in the customs database of the other country.
The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at audited financial and tax offices.
Priority was given to certain tax entities that carried out imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia that could not be identified in both databases.
In addition, some tax entities were selected for the verification of business transactions reported in VAT returns, for which data on imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were found in both databases.
4.3. Pilot check at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma
The border customs crossing point for pilot control was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
On the basis of a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the use of control sheets was introduced at the border customs crossing points between the Czech Republic and Slovakia from 1.6.1998.
The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as far as possible, to ensure an overview of the movement of commercial transport vehicles in the customs area and to create the conditions for comparing customs registers with each other.
The joint pilot inspection was carried out between 8.3.2004 and 26.3.2004 and aimed at examining this customs control system.
Procedure for the use of checklists at the Old Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing point:
1) Weighing the vehicle, issuing the control sheet and handing it over to the driver.
2) Parking of the vehicle in the designated sector in the parking lot.
Customs clearance in the check-in hall of the Police of the Czech Republic, Police of the Slovak Republic, Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.
The check-in was confirmed by individual files stamping on the inspection sheet.
3) Bringing the vehicle into the physical inspection area.
Presentation of the inspection sheet, JCD, or other documents to the customs official - verification of the completion of all prescribed acts and documents.
Performance of a physical check by the appropriate ingredients.
Release of a vehicle from the customs area.
Note: When importing goods into the Czech Republic, the weighing of the vehicle was carried out directly by employees of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
When the goods were imported into the Slovak Republic, the weighing of the vehicles was carried out by the staff of the authorised legal entity.
The vehicles were registered in the computerised register after weighing.
4.3.1. Control sample
Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia
The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the customs database of exports of the Czech Republic in 2002.
The composition of the export control sample is shown in Table 4.
4.3.2. Checklists and their records Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic
When exporting from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, the control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these control sheets in the electronic database of exports.
From the number of 453 JCD items, the SAO found 256 cases of imports into the Slovak Republic according to data from the customs database of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The remaining 197 JCD items were identified by the SAO SR in cooperation with the staff of the Drietoma border crossing point.
Exports from Slovakia to the Czech Republic
When exporting from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, the control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
From the total number of 339 JCD items of the selected control sample, the SAO in cooperation with border customs crossing staff assigned the corresponding registration numbers of the control sheets to the 295 JCD items.
The remaining 44 cases were identified in the register by the employees of the border customs crossing Drietoma and the export of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic was confirmed.
The SAO and SAO audit did not find any deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma.
4.4. Selected audit findings when verifying commercial transactions
Within the framework of international cooperation, the realization of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified from documents of customs administrations and financial or tax offices in the territory of the other state.
For selected tax entities, the following were verified:
- whether the submitted JCDs were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia,
- the fulfilment of the legal conditions for the application of the deduction of VAT on importation, the refund of excess VAT and the application of the VAT exemption on exportation.
The verification of commercial transactions revealed:
1. The SAO of Slovakia requested verification of the export of alcohol in the statistical value of 56 989 Sk.
The SAO identified the corresponding imports in the Czech customs database with a statistical value of CZK 42,624. r
2. A company engaged in the import and export of photographic equipment and accessories claimed an excess VAT deduction of CZK 3,740,664 in its VAT return for the month of December 2002.
In order to check reported exports from the Czech Republic, the SAO selected 3 JCD (16 items) with a statistical value of CZK 1,274,822.
The SAO of Slovakia identified 3 corresponding import JCDs (17 items) with a statistical value of 1,724,321 CZK.
VAT was paid to the competent customs office in the Slovak Republic.
3. In 2002, a company whose main business was the trade in optical equipment claimed a total excess VAT deduction of CZK 4 1 36 000 higher than the tax liability.
The SAO selected an export JCD (32 items) with a statistical value of CZK 7,154,124 to verify the reported business activity.
The SAO of Slovakia found that this JCD corresponds to the import JCD (12 items) with a statistical value of 9 653 827 Sk.
VAT was paid to the competent customs office in the Slovak Republic.
4. The company involved in, inter alia, the purchase of goods for resale and sale did not report any exports of goods in the VAT returns filed in 2002 and 2003.
According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of goods exports in 2002 totalled CZK 3,439,888.
Based on these facts, the SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) for verification in the total statistical value of CZK 669,839.
The SAO of Slovakia identified 5 corresponding import JCDs (5 items) with a statistical value of 1 012 656 Sk.
The audit of the SAO of the Slovak Republic at the relevant tax office showed that the declared imports were made and VAT was paid.
5. The company, whose business was, among other things, the purchase of goods for resale and sale, production, installation and repair of electrical machinery and appliances, reported in 2002 in VAT returns the export of goods worth CZK 12,966,706.
According to the Czech customs database, the total value of exports in 2002 was CZK 14,474,381.
The SAO submitted 17 export JCDs (59 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,975,122.
The SAO of Slovakia identified 13 JCD (50 items) in the customs database SR with a statistical value of 3 621 370 Sk.
The Slovak customs database failed to identify the corresponding import JCD to 4 export JCDs (9 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 399,776.
The relevant tax office in SR verified these imports with the taxpayer.
The tax entity listed on the JCD as an importer to the Slovak Republic stated in the minutes of the local investigation that it did not carry out the imports declared on the Czech export JCD.
The SAO of the Slovak Republic therefore asked the local tax office to carry out a tax audit of VAT and corporate income tax for the tax years 2002 and 2003.
6. According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, a company engaged in the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco stickers in 2002 with a statistical value of CZK 7,338,199 and in 2003 with a statistical value of CZK 12,228,545.
The company did not report any exports in its VAT returns in 2002 and 2003.
The SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) for verification in the total statistical value of CZK 2,471,598.
For 4 export JCDs (4 items) in the total statistical value of 2 246 860 CZK, the SAO SR identified 7 JCDs (7 items) in the customs database SR in the statistical value of 2 919 514 CZK.
The export JCD (1 item) in the statistical value of CZK 224,738 failed to assign the corresponding import in the customs database of SR.
7. The software company did not report exports of goods in its 2002 and 2003 VAT returns.
According to the Czech customs database, the statistical value of goods exports in 2002 and 2003 totalled CZK 1,630,198.
The SAO selected 9 JCD (9 items) for verification in SR, totalling CZK 755,588.
In the customs database SR SAO SR identified 8 JCD (8 items) in statistical value 915 601 Sk.
The export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 68,286 could not be assigned to the corresponding import in the SR customs database.
In these cases, it was not possible to identify the corresponding imports to 6 JCD in the customs database with a statistical value of CZK 692,800.
Of which:
- to 2 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic with a statistical value of 293 024 CZK, the corresponding import JCD could not be identified in the customs database of the Slovak Republic (see points 6 and 7).
Due to a certain error rate in entering data in the customs database, it was not possible to identify certain registered imports, e.g. in cases where the importer's name was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number (TIN).
Therefore, it cannot be concluded with certainty that these exports did not take place.
- to 4 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic, imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic in the statistical value of CZK 399,776 were not proven (see point 5).
In such cases, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that goods have been fictitiously exported for the purpose of wrongfully claiming a VAT deduction.
5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services within the scope of control of selected financial and tax authorities
5.1. Control sample
In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of tax entities in the import and export of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the tax and customs authorities, the files of tax entities were selected at the audited financial and tax offices according to the following criteria:
1. tax subjects were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia: (a) with the highest volume of imports, (b) with the highest amount of VAT charged, (c) with the highest volume of exports,
2. tax entities were selected from the register of the tax or tax authorities according to the amount of: (a) VAT deductions applied on importation, (b) excess VAT deductions applied, (c) VAT refund entitlement, (d) VAT exemption applied on exportation,
3. tax entities that have been subject to a tax audit.
The sampling was carried out irrespective of the country of destination, with a focus on risky commodities.
5.2. Inspection findings in the Czech Republic
An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is given in the following table:
5.2.1. Inspection of selected sample at financial offices
The SAO focused on:
- the procedure of the tax authorities in verifying the correctness of reported VAT,
- cooperation between the tax authorities and the customs administration,
- comparison of data from the customs database with the JCD database at the tax offices, focusing on the comparison of the declared value, the application of the correct VAT rate following the customs classification of goods or services, or comparison of the data on the JCD and the accompanying invoices with the data in the customs database,
- comparison of data from VAT returns on transactions carried out and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at tax offices or in the customs database;
- how to verify the right to VAT exemption when exporting goods or providing services abroad,
- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services declared in VAT returns with data from the customs database.
The JCD database at the tax offices contained only records of those imports and exports for which taxable persons were obliged to include the import or export in the tax return.
The audited tax authorities examined the files of tax subjects who had reported imports totalling CZK 60,396,379,000 in the 2002 and 2003 VAT returns and corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12,644,052,000.
In addition, the files of tax entities reporting exports in the tax returns for 2002 and 2003 totalling CZK 47,323,111,000 were checked.
According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, in 2002 and 2003, the tax subjects whose imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were examined carried out imports into the Czech Republic from the Slovak Republic with a total VAT base of 3 759 352 thousand CZK, VAT of 767 607 thousand CZK and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of 1 989 090 thousand CZK.
The identified differences between the records in the JCD database at the tax offices and in the customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:
- JCD items that were missing from the customs database of the Czech Republic were requested directly at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,
- JCD items that were missing from the Tax Offices database were checked for cancellations,
- for JCD items for which different values were found between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of financial offices, the respective JCD was requested from the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic in written form including the attached invoices.
The audit revealed that the JCD database at the tax offices did not contain, for example, records of import JCDs with a total value of VAT of CZK 3,622,000 and records of export JCDs with a total statistical value of CZK 9,359,000.
5.2.1.1. Differences found
A comparison of the JCD database at the tax offices and the cumulative tax liabilities for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT returns for a selected sample of tax entities revealed the following differences:
The differences in values were mainly due to:
- The time difference between the realisation of imports and the exercise of the right to deduct VAT charged on the importation of goods.
The taxpayer could exercise the right of deduction in respect of the importation of goods within three years of the end of the tax year in which the goods were placed under the relevant scheme or, in the case of the temporary importation scheme, within three years of the end of the tax year in which that scheme ceased.
- The time difference between the realisation of the export and the moment when the taxpayer received the JCD.
The taxpayer was required to enter the details of the exports carried out exempt from the obligation to apply output tax in the VAT return at the earliest for the tax period in which the goods left the territory of the country if he also had the tax document which was the JCD.
- Failure of taxable persons to comply with the obligations to declare imports and exports in VAT returns.
In some cases, tax subjects did not include correct data on imports and exports in their VAT returns.
The fact that tax subjects were not required to attach JCD lists to their VAT returns made it more difficult for the tax authorities to check the right to deduct or exempt VAT.
5.2.2. Synergies between financial and customs authorities
During the audited period, refunds or remissions of import or export duties and VAT were made on the basis of decisions taken by the customs authorities.
Tax subjects were required by law to reduce the previously exercised right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax refunded by the customs office in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.
No legislation provided for the sending of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs offices to tax offices.
Some audited tax offices received this information, but irregularly or with significant delays and only from some customs offices.
One audited IRS did not receive this information at all.
If the tax office did not receive information about changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the data needed to check the fulfilment of the legal obligation of the tax subjects.
In 2002, the customs authorities refunded VAT in the amount of more than CZK 319 million and in 2003 in the amount of more than CZK 398 million.
The results of the audit showed persistent shortcomings in the activities of the tax authorities, some systemic errors in the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs authorities and the non-fulfilment of some obligations of the tax payers submitting VAT and VAT returns.
In particular, weaknesses were found in the administration of VAT and VAT in the following areas:
a) in case of cancellation of VAT registrations, the fulfilment of the obligation of the payers to pay VAT on the commercial property registered or which should have been registered on the date of cancellation of the registration, with which the payer applied a tax deduction, was verified only rarely,
(b) the tax authorities have not consistently used the possibility to carry out tax inspections or local investigations.
This has in some cases led to a lack of verification of the validity of the right to deduct VAT.
(c) the official records and minutes of the oral hearing do not contain all the necessary data to substantiate the legitimacy of the excess VAT deductions applied;
(d) the tax authorities did not sufficiently verify the imports and exports declared in the VAT returns.
5.3. Control findings in SR
5.3.1. Inspection of selected sample at tax offices
The SAO scrutinized or audited the selected sample for tax years 2002 and 2003.
After analysing the submitted tax returns and requests for tax refunds from selected tax entities of the SAO SR, the Tax Office requested to secure the relevant JCDs documenting the import and export, invoices and proof of payment of the tax.
Subsequently, the SAO scrutinized whether the submitted JCDs were registered in the customs database of imports and exports and whether the decisive facts and legal conditions were fulfilled in the application of the deduction of input tax for imports, in the refund of excess VAT deduction, in the application of the exemption from export tax and in the refund of the SPD.
The SAO of the Slovak Republic audited selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic according to the number of JCD items and the sum of statistical values listed in the following table.
In total, imports in the statistical value of 856.2 million SKK were checked, which represents 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic into the SROV.
Exports of selected commodities were checked in the total statistical value of SKK 176 million, which represents 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic.
In addition, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white goods, packaging technology and software) from EU countries to Slovakia were checked for a total statistical value of SKK 532.8 million.
5.3.2. Synergies between tax and customs authorities
The SAO scrutinized the tax offices and found discrepancies between the data recorded in the customs database of the Slovak Republic and the data reported in specific VAT returns, e.g.:
– 2 tax subjects (natural persons) declared imports of goods with a total value of SKK 1 589 261 in their tax returns, on the basis of which they claimed a refund of excess VAT.
During local investigations carried out at the initiative of the SAO, tax subjects were not able to prove to the tax office the validity of the application of the input tax by the relevant documents on the completion of imports and payment of VAT.
- the tax entity (s. r. o.) in the tax return for the tax period January 2003 declared the received taxable transaction in the value of SKK 77 167 576, the export of goods in the value of SKK 18 006 041 and applied an excess VAT deduction in the amount of SKK 17 157 101.
It is apparent from the VAT returns filed for 2003 that the difference between the volume of purchases and exports of SKK 59 161 535, which arose in January 2003, was not made up during the whole of 2003.
In the above cases, the SAO asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the applied excess VAT deductions.
- in another case, the tax entity (s. r. o.) for the tax period January to June 2002 indicated in the VAT returns the export of goods with a total value of SKK 87 199.
A verification in the customs database of the Slovak Republic revealed that the taxpayer had exported a statistical value of SKK 296 747 during that period.
The Tax Office carried out several on-the-spot inspections at the company's registered office and found that the company's managing director (a UK citizen) had travelled and the company had left the leased premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.
At the time of the SAO audit, the tax administrator filed a report with the law enforcement authorities on suspicion of tax evasion.
The SAO of Slovakia, based on the results of the audit at selected tax offices, states that the biggest problems in the administration and control of VAT and VAT were mainly in the following areas:
- failure to make use of the possibility to carry out VAT tax audits on problematic tax subjects, in particular in cases of application of a high value of excess VAT deductions;
- the tax inspection reports did not contain an inventory of the documents checked
- JCD on import and export of goods,
- insufficient screening of declared imports and exports of goods in tax returns;
- a lengthy procedure for tax authorities to take decisions, in particular in the context of the assessment procedure, with the consequence that the right to assess penalties is extinguished;
- non-compliance with legal conditions when granting tax deferrals,
- failure to compensate VAT arrears within the deadline for the refund of excess VAT,
- insufficient use of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.
On the basis of the audited shortcomings, the SAO of the Slovak Republic requested the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of VAT with a focus on the validity of applied excess VAT deductions for 14 tax entities.
Measures were taken at all audited tax offices to remedy the deficiencies detected by the audit, the performance of which will be monitored and audited by the SAO SR.
6. Conclusion
International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions between trading partners from both countries and has highlighted shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.
The inspections also revealed persistent deficiencies in the fulfilment of the obligations of VAT and VAT payers, in the activities of the financial and tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs administrations, which ultimately reduced the effectiveness and efficiency of tax inspections.
The findings also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have at their disposal within the tax information system basic data on imports and exports from the customs database of the Czech Republic. In SR, there is no similar system for transmitting information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administrations.
The procedure for verifying the performance of the VAT and VAT administration was not the same due to the different legislation and conditions in the two countries.
The SAO verified the necessary data from information obtained at the Czech Customs Administration and from documents available at audited financial offices. The SAO verified the execution of commercial transactions from documents of tax entities requested through tax authorities.
If irregularities were found, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax inspections.
Parallel controls carried out in the area of VAT and SPD have assessed the state of administration of these taxes in the period prior to accession to the European Union and pointed to the need for further cooperation in this area.
Mutual cooperation will be further enhanced in the monitoring of the activities of the financial and tax authorities in connection with the adoption of the new VAT Act.
One of the new obligations relating to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of a so-called recapitulative statement.
This declaration must be made by all VAT payers who have made a supply of goods to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.
Tax administrators are obliged to enter the data from the recapitulative statements into the VIES (VAT Information Exchange System), to which tax administrators from the Member States of the European Union have access.
The tax or tax authorities then have the possibility to compare these data with the data contained in the submitted VAT returns.
Furthermore, this system is used to verify the validity of the VAT registration number of persons registered for VAT, to verify the validity of the VAT exemption applied to the supply of goods to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.
The implementation of parallel audits showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO of Slovakia.
The results of these control actions will be confronted with the outputs of the upcoming control actions, which will focus, among other things, on the examination of the VIES system, which is intended to prevent tax evasion in so-called "intra-community deliveries".
Given the importance of VAT and SPD for budgetary revenue, control activities need to focus primarily on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion of indirect taxes.

1. Introduction
Population migration is one of the global phenomena that have become an inseparable part of the current development phase of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
It is mainly caused by the flight of citizens from their country of origin or last permanent residence from persecution, in particular for racial, religious, national, political reasons, as well as from the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.
Their aim is to obtain asylum and integration into society, especially in one of the advanced democratic countries of Europe.
A large group also consists of foreigners whose migration is caused by unfavourable economic and living conditions.
Migration is not a new phenomenon.
The adoption of the 1951 Geneva Agreement and the 1967 New York Protocol on the Status of Refugees, by which the governments of the signatory countries undertook to apply them in their foreign policy orientations, already provided concrete principles for refugee assistance.
The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.
After the split in 1993, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to comply with the adopted international documents and confirmed their binding force within the framework of national legislation by a legal act.
Both republics have enshrined the granting of asylum in their constitutional laws.
Parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic focused on the asylum process and related issues, the results of which are contained in a joint final report.
The cooperation between the SAIs of both countries was implemented on the basis of the "Contract for Cooperation in Control Activities" (hereinafter referred to as "the Contract") concluded in April 2004.
The two Parties have undertaken in the Treaty to provide each other with information on the legislation governing the asylum procedure in the other Contracting Party, selected statistics on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.
The aim of the parallel control action was to identify the same problem areas and to highlight the consequences that this entails for population migration.
Cooperation consisted of the unification of the programme of control actions, the exchange of information to the extent provided for in the Treaty and the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the controls.
During the first joint meeting, which took place from 5.4. to 7.4.2004, the same topics of audited issues and control procedures were established in the preparation of audits.
At the second meeting, which took place from 28.6 to 30.6.2004, the common points for the programme of the audit action were specified.
During the third joint meeting, which took place during the audit operation from 8.11 to 10.11.2004, an exchange of experience from the on-going inspections took place.
The forms of the outputs from the checks have been specified and the structure and content of the Joint Final Report, which was drawn up between 14.2 and 17.2.2005 at the last joint meeting, have been preliminarily established.
The checks were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.
In the Czech Republic, the audit was carried out by inspectors of the Defence and Security Department and selected territorial departments.
The audited bodies were the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "MV") and the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "SUZ").
In the Slovak Republic carried out the inspection of the section of defence, vnútra and štátnych úradov.
The audited entity was the Migration Office of the Ministry vnútra SR (MÚ).
The audited period covered the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 (the audited period).
In some cases, statistical data covering a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.
2. Recapitulation of control results
2.1. Evaluation of control activities
- the asylum process, - the asylum facilities, - the management of state funds and assets, - the internal control system.
The mutual exchange of gained experience between the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of the audit actions.
This exchange allowed a more thorough evaluation of the submitted documents and an analysis of the causes of the identified differences in the security of the asylum process.
This made it possible to focus on the crucial issues affecting the activities of asylum facilities.
Ultimately, this had a positive effect on the quality of the audit work carried out.
2.2 Summary of control results
The harmonisation of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union (EU) documents has been the subject of European Commission evaluation reports on the preparedness of both countries for accession to the EU.
Legislation in this area has continued since both countries joined the EU, with a view to further alignment with EU law.
The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has been on a steadily increasing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, within the meaning of international agreements, provide financial and material security to asylum seekers.
The national budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure drawn from the national budget of both countries is influenced mainly by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the granting or non-granting of asylum, as well as the state of health of the applicants.
Some of the levies collected are comparable in both countries.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of the asylum seekers.
Asylum facilities shall provide asylum seekers with accommodation, meals, health care and basic material and hygiene equipment during their stay.
At the same time, free-time courses are organised and cultural and sporting opportunities are created for applicants.
Asylum facilities include reception and residence centres and, in the Czech Republic, integration centres.
The cost per day of stay depends on the availability and facilities of the centre and is comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilised.
In the Slovak Republic, it is expected to increase by almost 1 000 places in the next two years.
The aim is to create the conditions for applicants, a growing number of whom are expected to continue in the coming years in the context of the application of the Dublin Convention.
In the Czech Republic, the largest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on the provision of services. The main expenditure under this heading was the cost of accommodation and meals for applicants in the asylum facilities operated under the contract, the cost of health care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service for the protection of asylum facilities.
Expenditure on salaries, payments for work carried out and insurance premiums also accounted for a significant share of total expenditure.
In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the security of the migration policy and the asylum process was marked by many budgetary measures that addressed the justified demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance, expenditure on materials and services and expenditure on security services accounted for a significant share of current expenditure.
The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the financial management and management of state assets.
These were deficiencies in particular in the use of State Budget funds contrary to the purpose for which they were intended by the Act on the State Budget, where current expenditure covered actions having the character of technical evaluation of fixed tangible assets.
The Act on Accounting in Inventory and in Non-Compliance with Chart of Accounts was also violated.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of state property when it was passed on to another person without a contract.
Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the Land Registry data violated the Land Registry Act and leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorised to handle waste was a violation of the Waste Act.
Furthermore, in the Slovak Republic, deficiencies in the provision of unreasonably high advances for electricity and gas consumption, deficiencies in public procurement and in the management of state assets were found when the state's records were not sufficiently secured and the method of disposing of unneeded assets was not demonstrated.
The internal control system has been ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the generally binding legislation in force, which regulates the way financial control is carried out.
No deficiencies were found in the submitted written documentation.
The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, despite some shortcomings, evaluate positively the progress of SUZ and MU in providing services for asylum seekers.
Based on the findings of the audit, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic note that, despite the significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the respective organisational units of both countries have managed the tasks related to the care of asylum seekers to an adequate level.
The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.
The results of the audit were discussed with interested statutory representatives of the relevant organisational units of the state on the Czech and Slovak sides.
Based on the results of the audit, we recommend that the positive methodological experience of the audit be used for further joint audit actions within the framework of international cooperation of supreme audit institutions.
3. Legislative framework
In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, the right of asylum is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 New York Protocol).
The first legislation was implemented by Act No. 498/1990 Coll., on Refugees.
In the Czech Republic, Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and on the Amendment to Act No. 83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been in force since 1 January 2000.
This Act has been amended a total of five times (by Act No 2/2002 Coll., Act No 217/2002 Coll., Act No 320/2002 Coll., Act No 519/2002 Coll., and Act No 222/2003 Coll.).
Two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, are currently in the legislative process, and the adoption of further amendments will be linked to European legislation.
At the time of the creation of Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and asylum documents were political documents in terms of binding force.
Already during the adoption of this law, efforts were made to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.
A major change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum issues from the 3rd to the 1st pillar, when the right of asylum became part of Community law from 1.5.1999 on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This shift has triggered the need to create appropriate legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments with appropriate legal force.
The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.
Key Community regulations in the area of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic's accession to the EU and their transposition deadline had not yet expired at the time of the Supreme Audit Office's audit.
Once they have been implemented into Czech law, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of how it has transposed them.
In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of the state authorities in the procedure for granting refugee status and determining the obligations of foreigners who have applied for refugee status or who have been granted temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic was laid down with effect from 1.1.1996 by the Act of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No 283/1995 Z. z., o utečencoch.
Since 2003, the Refugee Act has been replaced by Act No 480/2002 Coll. on Asylum and on Amending and Supplementing Certain Acts, incorporating the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with Council of Europe Directive 2001/55/EC of 20 July 2001 on minimum standards for providing temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving and bearing the resulting consequences.
After two amendments to Act No. 480/2002 Coll., on Asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with the EU legislation on migration and asylum.
Its important elements are, for example, the obligation for asylum-seekers to attend a course on the basics of the Slovak language during their stay in the integration centre, the designation of a guardian by the courts for underage foreigners if they reside in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, the possibility for applicants to enter into an employment relationship under certain circumstances specified in the amendment to the Act.
The harmonisation of Slovak law with EU law on migration and the asylum process has been assessed in the European Commission's regular reports on the preparedness for the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.
In 2002, a report highlighted the lack of staffing of the Ministry, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.
4. Asylum process
In the Czech Republic, matters relating to refugees have been the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior since 1990.
With effect from 1 January 1996, the Ministry established the organisational unit of the State of SUZ. The reason was the separation of the state administration in the area of asylum procedure, which is carried out through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the Ministry of Interior, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.
The mission of the SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services to asylum seekers and asylum seekers for the Ministry.
In the Slovak Republic, the MU performs critical tasks in the area of the asylum process, in particular in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process to the extent defined by specific regulations.
Priority tasks are issues related to the decision on applications of foreigners for asylum at the first level of administrative procedure and the complex operation of asylum facilities in the area of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security of asylum seekers.
In addition, it prepares concepts on the migration policy of the state.
Cooperation and support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has significantly influenced the results achieved in the development of the asylum system in the Slovak Republic in recent years.
A particular benefit was his financial contribution to the reconstruction of the housing stock for asylum seekers.
The UNHCR also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.
4.1 Evolution of the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process
The development of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.
There was a significant increase in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and an increase in the number of refugees from Chechnya in 2003.
An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic is given in Table 1.
In total, 394 cases were granted asylum during the audited period, including 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.
A total of 22 731 asylum cases were not granted during the audited period and 22 636 asylum procedures were discontinued.
The number of parties to proceedings at 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been the subject of a judgment and those who have not been the subject of a judgment.
It also includes persons who have been forgiven for missing the deadline for lodging an appeal, or who have had a previous decision annulled and have not yet been issued with a new one.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers is on a steadily increasing trend.
While there were 96 registered applicants in 1993, there were 10 358 in 2003.
There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, when 8 131 applicants were registered, which represented an increase of 423% compared to 2000, when 1 556 people applied for asylum.
Data on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic during the audited period are presented in Table 2.
In the audited period, a total of 49 asylum applications were granted and their number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in each year.
Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.
Asylum procedures were stopped in a total of 23 088 cases.
By staying outside the asylum facility without a permit, the majority of applicants voluntarily left the asylum procedure before it was completed.
In 2002 it was more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants and in 2003 it was more than 94% of persons.
The duration of an applicant's stay in an asylum facility, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.
The findings of the Ministry also show that the majority of applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are seeking better living conditions, i.e. so-called economic migration, which has no basis in the documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has also subscribed.
In these cases, the asylum system is used by the applicants for a specific purpose.
An application for asylum based on economic reasons, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, is not a ground for granting asylum.
Such an application should, in accordance with the provisions of Article 12(1)(a) of Law No 480/2002 on asylum, be considered to be manifestly unfounded and be decided within 30 days.
There are still no internationally recognised principles for identifying economic migrants to distinguish them from those persecuted in their country of origin and to speed up the asylum process.
In the light of the above, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is a transit country in terms of international migration and the countries of destination for migration were and remain Western European countries.
Upon accession to the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement determining the State responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).
The Convention prevents multiple ad hoc asylum applications from being made in more than one EU country.
Applicants return to the country of first registration after being positively identified in EURODAC.
As the Slovak Republic is part of the external border of EU countries, the application of the Dublin Convention may in the next period result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create conditions to stay in the Slovak Republic pending a decision on whether or not to grant asylum.
4.2 Implementation of funds
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers in accordance with international agreements and the resulting national legislation.
The national budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the final decision on the granting of asylum, as well as their state of health.
The increasing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the increased uptake of statutory benefits for applicants, such as food, pocket money, expenditure on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.
Some of the levies collected are comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic during the audited period, the meal allowance was CZK 58 per person per day, the allowance was CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child up to the age of 15.
The average cost per asylum seeker per stay day was CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.
In addition to pocket money, an allowance of up to the minimum subsistence level may be granted to asylum seekers accommodated in self-catering accommodation centres and to applicants accommodated in private accommodation outside asylum facilities.
Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, inter alia grants municipalities the right to a contribution to cover the costs incurred in connection with an asylum facility on their territory in Section 84.
The amount of the allowance was determined annually by government resolutions and in the audited period it amounted to CZK 7 per person per stay day.
At the same time, municipalities are entitled to a contribution to cover the non-investment costs of the primary schools attended by asylum seekers.
The amount of the allowance was CZK 120 per pupil per month in the audited period, provided that the person attended the school for at least 10 days in that month.
In the Slovak Republic, during the audited period, the meal allowance was SKK 70 per person per day, the allowance was SKK 12 per person per day and SKK 8 per child up to 15 years of age.
The cost per asylum seeker per stay day was on average SKK 442 in 2001, SKK 447 in 2002 and SKK 445 in 2003.
Municipalities in whose territory an asylum facility is located are granted a contribution to cover part of the costs incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and operation of the asylum facility, in accordance with Act No 480/2002 Coll., on Asylum.
Municipalities have so far made only partial use of the possibility to apply for the allowance, which is set at SKK 1 500 per bed per calendar year.
National legislation in both countries provides for a 90-day period from the initiation of the asylum procedure to issue an asylum decision, while allowing for an extension of that period in justified cases.
The most common reason for extending the asylum procedure, which affects the level of state budget expenditure, is the lodging of appeals against the decision not to grant asylum.
In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was delivered between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).
The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of the asylum application (17.61%).
Overall, 73% of the asylum procedures opened in 2001-2003 were finally decided within one year of their opening.
Within two years of the opening of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications were finally decided.
In the Slovak Republic, according to the Ministry of Justice, up to 90 % of applicants who have not been granted asylum make use of the legal possibility to extend the deadline by lodging an appeal with a court.
In some cases it was extended by more than a year and the court proceedings were not concluded at the time of the inspection.
Some benefit in shortening the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of joint workplaces of the Ministry and the Office of the Border and Cudzinecke Police Force in the reception centres in Adam-Gbeloch, Opatovský Novy. Liptovský Vlachoch, which was taken at the time of the execution of the inspection since 1.10.2004.
This is intended to simplify procedures and shorten the time limits for procedures between the two components of the asylum process.
5. Asylum facilities
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the provision of services to participants in the asylum procedure.
Asylum facilities provide asylum seekers with accommodation, meals, health care, pocket money and basic material and sanitary supplies during their stay.
At the same time, courses are organised as part of leisure activities and the conditions for cultural and sporting activities are created for applicants.
5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic
SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is responsible for managing state property in the premises of the reception centre Vyšní Lhota, reception and residence centre Červený Újezd, residential centres Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the premises of the integration asylum centres Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.
At the beginning of 2002, a reception centre was established in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.
SUZ also operates asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntál, Zbýšov and Kashav, which are operated by a legal entity on the basis of Section 80(3) of Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum.
The total accommodation capacity of the reception centres is 747 places and the total accommodation capacity of the residential centres is 1 977 places.
Reception centres are closed facilities that asylum seekers are not allowed to leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception operations referred to in Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum have been carried out.
Failure to comply with the obligation to stay in a reception centre is considered a misdemeanour.
The accommodation centres to which asylum seekers arrive from reception centres shall be used to accommodate asylum seekers until the decision on their application or non-application becomes final.
Under certain conditions, asylum seekers have the possibility to leave or stay in private.
Asylum seekers have the right to free accommodation, food, other services and pocket money in the reception and residence centres in which they are registered for residence, provided that they have taken the necessary steps to ascertain their financial and financial situation, and that situation is such that they cannot reasonably be required to pay part of those services.
Integration asylum centres shall serve as temporary accommodation for persons who have been granted asylum.
Clients are accommodated in the centre on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of extension until they can be provided with adequate housing or they can arrange it themselves within the framework of the state integration programme.
In the integration centre, clients pay all accommodation costs and eat individually.
Persons with recognised refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.
5.1.1 Costs of asylum facilities
For the comparison of asylum facilities, it was chosen as the best indicator of the amount of costs per physical stay day.
It is based on the actual number of persons to whom services provided by the asylum facility have actually been provided on a daily basis.
In Table 3 and in the graph, the facilities operated by SUZs are designated as own and those operated by legal entities on the basis of Section 80 of Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as contractual.
The cost of one day's stay at the SUZ's own asylum facility decreases with the increase in the number of such facilities. This is due to the fact that the fixed costs of running the premises are allocated to more asylum seekers.
The total cost of providing services to asylum seekers increases in direct proportion as the number of asylum seekers increases.
In 2001 and 2003, asylum seekers in crisis capacity were accommodated in their own asylum facilities.
In part of 2003, extra accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds in total) was even used to deal with the capacity crisis in asylum facilities caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.
This capacity was provided by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.
Expenditure per applicant per day of stay was lower in these years.
However, it is not possible to maintain a high level of capacity in these facilities in the long term.
Account should be taken of the risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated requirement for increased accommodation capacity.
At the same time, it is not possible to carry out certain repairs, maintenance and investments when the accommodation capacity is fully occupied.
The form of the asylum facilities operated under contract allows for the adoption of operational solutions in the area of the capacity of the asylum facilities, where necessary.
5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic
Asylum facilities are reception centres and residence centres.
The Ministry has in its administration the reception centres Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the residential centre Brezová pod Bradlom.
The total capacity of the reception centres is 470 places and the accommodation centre 100 places.
The growing number of asylum seekers was dealt with by the Ministry by setting up a residential centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Slovak Technical University of Bratislava with a flexible available capacity of 250 to 940 places.
According to the contract concluded, the lessor also ensures the provision of services related to the operation of the centre.
In this form, MÚ solved the lack of its own staff.
The residential centre was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 places.
Admission centers had an average occupancy rate of 57% to 62% during the audited period, while residential centers had an average occupancy rate of 33% to 50%.
Occupancy varied with the season and was highest in the last months of the year, when many more applicants applied for asylum compared to other months of the year.
Further increase of accommodation capacity by about 450 places will be possible after the reconstruction of the resorts in Opatovská, Nové Vsi and Vlachoch.
With the completion of the centre in Humennom in 2006, the number of seats will increase by a further 550 persons.
5.2.1 Costs of asylum facilities
Data on the costs of running asylum facilities are given in Table 4.
Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another entity providing premises and ensuring the operation of the facility, including the related activities, is one of the options for safeguarding, at a reasonable cost, the tasks resulting from the asylum seekers’ stay in the Slovak Republic.
6. Management of State funds and property
6.1 Economic analysis
In the Czech Republic, the approved budget expenditure of SUZ was increased by CZK 103,077 thousand by thirteen budget measures in 2001.
Of this, CZK 89,979,000 (87.29%) were earmarked funds. The bulk of it was intended to deal with the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44,538,000) and to provide health care to asylum seekers (CZK 38,870,000).
In 2002, SUZ expenditure was increased by CZK 88,362,000 by twenty budget measures.
Of this, CZK 62,282,000 (70.48%) were earmarked funds, the bulk of which (CZK 53,200,000) was intended for health care provided to asylum seekers.
In 2003, the expenditure of SUZ was increased by fourteen budgetary measures by a total of CZK 88,078,000.
Of this, CZK 82,000,000 (93.09%) were earmarked funds released from the General Treasury Administration.
The amount of CZK 51,000,000 was intended for health care provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24,000,000 for dealing with the influx of Chechen refugees, and CZK 7,000,000 for the humanitarian evacuation program of disabled residents of the Republic of Iraq.
An overview of the execution of the selected SUZ expenditure in the audited period is given in Table 5.
It is clear from the overview above that the largest part of the expenditure was spent on the provision of services.
Expenditure on purchasing services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total expenditure.
Expenditure on accommodation and catering for applicants in contract-based asylum facilities, expenditure on medical care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service for guarding individual asylum facilities were inflammatory expenditure under this heading.
Expenditure on salaries, payments for work done and insurance premiums (23.99% - 24.97%) accounted for a significant share of the total SUZ expenditure.
Last but not least, purchases of materials accounted for a significant share of total SUZ expenditure (around 14%), with the largest share of this expenditure coming from food purchases (7.61%? 9.83% of total expenditure).
In the Slovak Republic, the budget management of the Ministry for the security of the migration policy and asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures, which addressed justified demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
The draft and budget breakdown in the expenditure section was characterised, in particular in 2001 and 2002, by an imbalance between the requirements of the MA, which were based on the increase in the number of asylum seekers and the need to finance their legal entitlements, and the resources provided, in particular in the main category of current expenditure.
The budget chapter administrator addressed the disproportion with several budgetary measures during the year, increasing the current expenditure limit by 41.8% in 2001 and by 71.7% in 2002.
An overview of the implementation of selected MU expenditure in the audited period is given in Table 6.
Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums in the range of 24.47% to 30.51% and expenditure on materials and services in the range of 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure contributed decisively to the absorption of current expenditure.
More than 10% was spent on security services and between 3.92% and 7.20% on food purchases.
Another significant part was expenditure on accommodation and catering services, ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.
Capital expenditure accounted for a relatively low share, ranging from 1.03% to 6.25%.
6.2 Weaknesses identified
The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed to some similar deficiencies which did not have a major impact on the management of state funds and assets.
These were deficiencies in particular in the following areas: (b) infringement of the Accounting Act in the area of inventories and non-compliance with the indicative chart of accounts.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies in the disposal of state property were also found when it was passed on to another person without a proper contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the Land Registry data violated the Land Registry Act; Leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not the person authorised to dispose of the waste was in breach of the Waste Act.
In the Slovak Republic, deficiencies in the provision of unreasonably high advances for the consumption of electricity and natural gas, deficiencies in public procurement and in the management of the state's assets were found when the state's records were not sufficiently secured and the method of disposing of unneeded assets was not demonstrated.
7. Internal control system
In the Czech Republic, an internal control system within the meaning of the provisions of Act No.320/2001 Coll., on financial control, defining the competencies of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, ongoing and subsequent control, was introduced at SUZ on 1 July 2002.
At the same time, an internal audit system was put in place and an internal auditor of the SUZ was appointed.
Each year, SUZs are issued with a plan of financial, social and operational technical controls aimed at a comprehensive verification of the management of state funds and property in individual asylum facilities managed by SUZs.
42 management checks were carried out in 2002 and 54 in 2003.
In the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic directly performs the audit activities in the departments and organisations of the Ministry of the Interior with regard to compliance with generally binding legal regulations and internal regulations.
No checks were carried out on the performance of tasks in the field of asylum policy during the audited period.
The internal control system of the Ministry of Finance is focused mainly on the implementation of preliminary and continuous financial control according to the Act No. 502/2001 Coll., on financial control and internal audit.
The performance of financial control is also regulated by internal regulations of the Director of the Ministry.
The substantive focus of the audit activity as part of the management of individual departments was established in the framework of the MU's annual plan.
Union directors have been designated as responsible for exercising control in this area.
According to the submitted written documentation, no deficiencies were found.
Since the entry into force of Decree No 28 of 23 April 2004 of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of Interior has been obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the Complaints Act.
The organizational security of this task will need to be resolved in the near future.

This report was drawn up in the Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office and the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic.
Joint Report on Parallel Checks on Motorway Construction Expenditure Prague – Dresden
Opening Word
Without trans-European transport networks, a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe would be hard to imagine.
Quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the standard of living of Europeans.
Creating the conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of people and goods is an important task for the state administration.
It is a very demanding task both in organisational and technical terms and in financial terms.
European efforts at sustainable mobility often find it difficult to compromise with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.
The construction of transport infrastructure, also thanks to the necessary measures for the benefit of the environment, is financially demanding.
Considerate procedures and decision-making by the state administration in the preparation and acquisition of transport constructions can bring significant savings in public financial resources that can be used for the benefit of citizens in other ways.
One of the roles of audit institutions is to actively identify deficiencies that have led to lower than achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on transport infrastructure construction.
The audit institutions should not only alert the public administration to the shortcomings identified, but recommend measures to improve the situation, for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.
Short Summary
The two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as Germany and the Czech Republic), the Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as BRH) and the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the SAO), carried out parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (motorway D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in Germany) in 2005 and 2006.
The motorways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by both countries.
Thanks to cooperation with the SAO, BRH was able to carry out a thorough check of the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.
Based on the close cooperation with BRH, the SAO obtained the necessary data on the German costs of bridges and tunnels for comparative purposes.
The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of a border bridge in 2000.
According to the construction process, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.
However, in the course of awarding the contract, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the RMD) made errors which led to an extension of the competition period and a shortening of the construction period.
The contract with the contractor was therefore signed later than expected.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.
As a result, however, the RMD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.
As part of the joint inspection work, the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 motorways were compared on the basis of the conversion per square metre of the bridge construction area.
Statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high costs per square metre of area.
Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in the group of large bridges with a length of over 100 meters.
The price increase could also be attributed to the delay in the procurement procedure.
When analysing the tunnel construction costs, the auditors found that the tunnel prices on the D8 motorway were significantly higher than those of comparable tunnels in Germany.
BRH and the SAO now have a database of prices of bridges and tunnels on which they will be able to rely in future checks on the effectiveness of the funds used for transport infrastructure purposes.
For the construction of bridges, both audit institutions recommend: standardization of bridge structures and use of combined steel-concrete and special structures only in cases where prestressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.
The main features of the collaboration were its team spirit and informality.
During the parallel inspection, the auditors shared their specific knowledge and skills.
Introduction
This report informs about the progress and results of parallel inspections of funds spent on the construction of a motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The audits focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure incurred.
Parallel audits were carried out by BRH in Germany and SAO in the Czech Republic.
Parallel inspections took place in 2005 and 2006.
The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure amounting to approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately EUR 690 million) on the border section of the D8 motorway, which has the number 0807.
Of this amount, € 64 million from European funds (ISPA) were planned to be used.
In addition to a parallel audit carried out jointly with the SAO, the BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.
The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A17 motorway amounted to around €670 million, of which €277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).
The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden – Central and Southern parts of Eastern Europe – Istanbul.
The D8 motorway runs from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.
The A17 motorway runs from the Czech Republic/Germany border to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, the border sections of both motorways were under construction.
These sections were put into operation on 21 December 2006.
On the German side, the motorway is finished until Dresden, while on the Czech side of the D8 motorway it is not finished, because the section No. 0805 of 16.4 km through the Bohemian Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosicemi is still in the preparatory phase.
According to the plan, section No.0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of the Bohemian Central Mountains.
According to forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, the traffic intensity on the border section No 0807 of the D 8 motorway should be 22 940 vehicles per day in 2008.
According to German forecasts, traffic at the Czech border will total about 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded an agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the interconnection of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 at the common state border by the construction of a border bridge.
Both countries are involved in the construction of the bridge, so the control of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of the parallel checks carried out by both control institutions.
Cooperation between BRH and SAO
Since mid-2005, the two supreme audit institutions have been discussing close cooperation in the inspection of the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.
Both sides had serious reasons for such cooperation:
1.
Germany participates financially in the construction of the border bridge.
Its planning and construction rests on the RMD.
Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to carry out an inspection of that construction project.
2.
The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically in terms of the overall level of costs for bridges and tunnels on D 8.
3.
The SAO needed to make sure that the expenditures were effective, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, especially the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of travel on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, an Agreement on the coordinated control of the D 8/A 17 motorway was signed by the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions on 4 January 2006.
The joint working meetings of the auditors of BRH and SAO took place during the whole year 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.
The meetings addressed current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for the control of the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the control of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.
The continuous exchange of information was an important sign of cooperation.
While BRH carried out most of the work on comparing technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and tendering procedures, the SAO prepared a methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels.
The applicable legal standards for government control differ between the two countries in the way control actions are closed.
For these reasons, the two SAIs drew their own audit conclusions on their findings during their inspections.
This report reflects the results achieved by the parallel controls.
The cooperation will be concluded by the signing of the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Border bridge construction
In a contract of 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a date of completion of the construction of the border bridge in 2005, as far as possible.
The two parties then agreed to postpone the deadline until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as an investor.
Germany accounts for 42.13% of the construction of the bridge.
In the period up to 1999, the RMD proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed reinforced concrete structure.
In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the RMD agreed to a coupled steel-concrete structure.
This decision was justified by the reduction of the number of double pillars from seven to five and the consequent environmental benefits of such a solution for the valley.
In addition, the comparative calculations carried out by the RMD indicated that the steel-concrete coupled construction should be a less costly option.
But there was an error in the calculations.
They stated that the new bonded steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.
It's actually 5% longer.
During the award of the contract for the border bridge, the RMD made serious errors.
It did not prepare procurement documents adequately describing the assessment criteria and sub-criteria for the comparison of tenders.
This error resulted in the evaluation and evaluation committee and the Director-General evaluating the tenders in a subjective and problematic manner.
The unsuccessful tenderer contested the results of the procurement procedure.
A subsequent investigation by the Office for the Protection of Competition led to the conclusion of the contract for the award of the works contract later than originally envisaged.
This meant that the 2004 summer construction season, after evaluation of the bids, was wasted and the time allocated for construction was shortened.
The construction company agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, but at the cost of significantly increasing costs.
The procedure offered included the double installation of the bridge superstructure, a change in the structure of the pillars and the installation and fitting-out of the assembly areas.
In addition, the construction company was not able to procure the originally designed type of steel in due time.
The new type of steel – at a cost of about €4 million, which had to be paid in full by the RMD – made it possible to reduce the time taken to implement the corrosion protection, which in turn made it possible to reduce the overall construction time of the border bridge.
Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of the construction of the border bridge will increase significantly as a result of the accelerated procedure and other modifications in the funding.
The reduced time allocated to construction work resulted in a price increase of around €5.9 million.
Currently, the net cost is around €25.9 million, not taking into account the automatic price increase (as of October 2006).
Comparison of bridge and tunnel prices
The two supreme audit institutions analysed the prices of bridges on the D8 and A17 motorways in order to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.
The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.
Furthermore, tunnels on the D8 were compared with similar tunnels on motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).
There are no similar tunnels on the A-17.
In preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to identify precisely the relevant prices.
The two supreme audit institutions have established the following principles for the comparison of bridge prices: based on the actual price paid for the bridge excluding value added tax (VAT rates differ in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and are subject to changes); do not take into account prices for special bases of the bridge; convert prices in CZK into € according to the European Central Bank rate valid on 30.12.2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).
On both D 8 and A 17 there are bridges of various constructions (steel-concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, bonded steel-concrete and steel) and of different sizes.
In order to ensure the homogeneity of the studied structures, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.
Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.
Concrete bridges were by far the most common type of construction on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D8, 36 bridges on the A17).
The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, as the numerical size of the set allowed the use of mathematical and statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of the results.
The inspections found that the prices per m 2 of concrete bridges on both D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of bridge construction.
For German bridges, the price dependence on size was stronger than for Czech bridges (see graphs below).
Two concrete bridges on the A 17 and four on the D 8 have been identified and their price is significantly higher.
In order to find these bridges, a method was used that allowed to find atypical values in the set of numbers, and a regression analysis that took into account the dependence of the price of the bridge on its size (for the determination of atypically expensive bridges, the distance from the regression curve upwards is decisive).
However, information on the atypically high price of those bridges should only be considered as an indicator of which bridges should be targeted.
In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of the high price in each case identified should be analysed.
One such cause may be inefficient administrative measures, or environmental protection requirements or any other plausible reason.
Given that the Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than the German ones (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the price of the bridge on its length could lead to the assumption that the Czech bridges should be cheaper.
The hypothesis of lower prices of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labour costs in the construction sector in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on D 8 are higher than on A 17.
In the course of the joint discussions, two possible causes have been identified:
1.
In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.
Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional firms to compete for the contract.
In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of a contract for a part of the motorway route, which is several kilometres long.
Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too big for them.
2.
There is more variability in bridge construction in the Czech Republic than in Germany.
In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge construction was decided long before its construction.
The decision is taken at the time when the application for a territorial decision is submitted to the RMD.
Although the RMD selects types of bridges from several variants at this time, economy plays a smaller role in the decision-making process.
A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be reached on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction works market in both countries, which would, however, go beyond the scope of this control action.
The boundary bridge is the most expensive bonded steel concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.
In the case of tunnels, it was found that tunnel prices on D 8 are twice as high as tunnels in Germany.
However, a comparison of the main construction-technical parameters of the tunnels on the D8 with the tunnels in Germany did not show any significant difference.
Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the tunnel construction industry in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow for any generally applicable conclusions.
Effectiveness and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden-Prague motorway
A separate Czech Republic was established in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the concept of developing a motorway network.
The D8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.
Section No. 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains should have been acquired before the border section No. 0807.
The Czech Republic acquires the D8 motorway as part of the programme financing.
In programme no. 327 220 „Construction of the D8 motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – state border of the Czech Republic/Germany” two objectives of the construction of the D8 motorway were set:
1.
to improve the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem – a national goal;
2.
Improve the connection between Prague and Berlin within the framework of the IV Trans-European Transport Corridor Berlin – Istanbul – an international objective.
According to the programme, the construction of the section leading through České středohoří should have been completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section No. 0807 in June 2007.
It should be added here that the date of completion is not identical to the date of commissioning.
The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains is now in the stage of an official zoning decision.
Environmental activists challenged the decision with lawsuits.
No final judgment is given on the actions.
Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the section leading through České středohoří will be completed several years later than indicated in the programme documentation.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the completion date of section 0805 to 2010.
As a result of these facts, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective of improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.
The RMD carried out an estimate of capital expenditure for the border section D 8 No 0807 and the section No 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains in the years 1999-2001.
The estimated capital expenditure included in the investment costs amounts to about €639 million in total for both sections 0805 and 0807.
Table 2: Results of the economic assessment (EIRR)
All the motorways and expressways under consideration were opened, both sections of the D8 were opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010
All the motorways and expressways under consideration were opened, both sections of the D8 were opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 22,000 vehicles per day in 2010
All the motorways and expressways under consideration were opened, both sections of the D8 were opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010
The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and the section through the Czech Central Mountains would be completed in time.
At the time of the inspection, however, it is clear that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains will not be opened at the original date.
This will reduce the above EIRRs.
The cost of both sections, net of VAT, as at 31.12.2005, was €897 million, i.e. 27.4% higher than the cost level used in the economic analysis in 2001.
However, there is a risk that section 0805 will be run on a different, more costly route, which would affect the above-mentioned economic viability threshold.
Economic analysis has shown that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable with a traffic intensity of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The forecast for 2008 amounted to 22 940 vehicles, but the study dealing with the issue of bypass routes for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains counts on the traffic intensity of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day, which pushes the investment below the economic viability threshold.
With a higher load on bypass routes for the missing section through České středohoří, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which were not foreseen in the original economic analysis.
The above mentioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the border section D 8 should have had will not be achieved.
Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.
The construction of the A 17 motorway also involved similar cost overruns as the two sections of the D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment of the 1992 Federal Road Development Plan for long-distance transport, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany calculated a cost of about €320 million.
The resulting cost-benefit ratio was 4.6.
In the meantime, however, costs have risen sharply to about €670 million, reducing the cost-benefit ratio by more than half.
In addition to a parallel audit carried out jointly with the SAO, the BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.
The BRH found that the competent State approval authority had requested an off-road tunnel for the third section of A17, which was not needed.
During the inspection, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German Road Construction Administration that the tunnel was not necessary.
This resulted in savings of around €10 million in construction costs alone and €0.15 million in annual operating costs.
In its assessment of Section A 17, the BRH found that the construction project had not been properly prepared.
This is illustrated by the following example:
At the preparatory stage, the Road Construction Administration did not investigate the bedrock conditions in the Dölzschen rocks because the site was difficult to access.
This was done after the tunnel excavator hit the rock.
Tests have shown that the rocks inside are more weathered than anticipated during the selection process.
Costly measures such as anchoring, grouting and protective nets against falling rocks had to be taken, costing around €3.3 million.
The Road and Motorway Directorate had to bear the costs not only of other emergency operations, such as security measures in the rocks of Dölzschen, but also of measures that would not have been necessary if the construction project had been properly prepared first.
Expenditure of this kind includes costs related to interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), additional training of drilling personnel (€0.5 million) and rising wages and expenditure on goods due to project duration overruns (€7 million).
The cost overrun thus amounted to around €10.7 million, which did not correspond to any added value.
On the basis of the lessons learned from this and other audited projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter guidance in its supervision of road construction works.
In doing so, the Federal Ministry should give the Road and Motorway Directorates the necessary impetus to introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and SAO Cooperation fulfilled the intention of both audit institutions.
BRH gained control knowledge about the preparation, commissioning and progress of the construction of the border bridge.
The two supreme audit institutions have built up a database of bridge and tunnel prices on which future controls can be based.
The SAO found that the main construction and technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway did not differ from those of the A 17.
The auditors of the two institutions involved in the cooperation gained new experience which they can use in further inspections.

Coordinated control of funds earmarked for financing projects implemented under the Operational Programme for Cross-border Cooperation Czech Republic – Republic of Poland 2007–2013
INTRODUCTION
Europe's developing community is a driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.
So let this community give an introduction to this joint report by the two supreme audit institutions of the neighbouring countries:
"185 million EU citizens (or 37% of the population) live in border areas.
These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often a remnant of the darker parts of Europe's history.
The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help alleviate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and further help develop the dormant potential of border regions.
The programmes cover different border regions: some cover sea basins, others inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.
Most of the programmes are bilateral, but some include more than two neighbouring countries. “
The programmes run for seven years and receive a total of €5.7 billion from the EU budget.
‘The programmes include the following activities: repairing and rebuilding cross-border roads, cycle paths and bridges, investing in cross-border waste management systems, health facilities, research centres, flood control measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or development of tourist destinations, development of common services for the local population, advice on employment issues, creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.
Support from the programme is provided on condition that organisations from both sides of the border (e.g. regional authorities, universities or SMEs) come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.
Representatives of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly to decide which projects will be supported.
This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself has ended.
The funding is provided on condition that project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four elements: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing. “
Under the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.
The main attributes of the partnership are: joint selection of the lead partner, joint preparation of the project and the application, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, assumption of overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the lead partner, total support payments received by the lead partner and transferred to the relevant project partners.
Eligible projects implemented on the territory of regions and voivodships adjacent to the common border may be supported.
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CONTROL
On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic – Republic of Poland 2007–2013 (OPPS ČR–POL).
€258,187,467 was earmarked for the implementation of the operational programme.
The total included a contribution from European Funds (ERDF) totalling €219,459,344 (85%) which must be used by the end of 2015.
The financial data on the absorption of EU funds from the Operational Programme Cross-border Cooperation Czech Republic – Republic of Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 are presented in the following table:
The agreement on the cooperation of supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both authorities on 27 February 2013 after previous mutual negotiations at the meeting of the heads of supreme audit institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia, which took place in September 2012 in Lovasberény, Hungary.
The aim of the cooperation was to verify that the implementation of the operational programme is carried out in accordance with the legislation and with the binding programming documents or agreements, that the management and control system functions reliably, that the objectives of the operational programme are achieved and that the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the established conditions of the support provided.
This cooperation took the form of a parallel audit, in which the audit authorities independently examined, on the basis of their statutory mandate, subjects whose content had been discussed jointly beforehand.

The audit carried out also included elements of a performance audit.
The selected topics were tested on a sample of projects at project partners on both sides of the border.
As a result of the checks carried out, the audit conclusions were published in the usual way by both authorities.
On the basis of the two audit conclusions set out in the Annex, this Joint Report was established.
The selected joint control sample included six projects (Annex 1) under aid area 1.1 — Strengthening transport accessibility and aid area 2.2 — Promoting tourism development.
Before the start of the audit, the drawing of funds from these two areas of support represented more than 60% of the funds paid to the beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects within the whole OPPS CR-POL.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In addition to the auditing of a joint sample of six projects, the SAO audited another 13 projects and the NIK audited two others (all from the support area 1.1 and 2.2).
The funds paid to the beneficiaries from the ERDF, which were audited by the SAO and NIK, totalled 25,362,174 € (SAO) and 8,450,784 € (NIK).
The audited volume accounted for 41 % of the total amount paid to beneficiaries from aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.
MAIN CONTROL CONCLUSIONS
Both audits carried out independently by the SAO on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of identified irregularities did not exceed the level of significance.
Implementation of the OPPS CR–POL, including the operation of the management and control system and implementation of selected projects, was successful.
The auditees, which were part of the management and control system, took steps to reduce the risk of misuse of funds and non-use of ERDF funds.
Proof of the effectiveness of the implemented projects under the operational programme is the high level of achievement of the set objectives, which was supported by the results of the survey of the social evaluation of the implementation of the projects.
SUMMARY OF CONTROL RESULTS
A. Evaluation of the management and control system
The coordinated approach made it possible to check the management and control system of the OPPS CR-POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry of Regional Development of the Czech Republic), the national coordinator (Ministry of Regional Development of the Czech Republic) and the controllers (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodship).
At the same time, the coordinated audit allowed an evaluation of the tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.
During the evaluation of the management system, the audit focused on activities carried out in connection with the setting up and performance of the functions of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in connection with the setting of the objectives of the programme and the monitoring of the progress achieved, evaluation activities and annual reports, the assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, the drawdown of programme funds and the fulfilment of the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on grants, the control activities of the managing authority, the setting of the performance of activities and the results of the audits of the delegated body and the system of reporting and monitoring of irregularities and its compliance.
Furthermore, the work of the competent authorities in the area of risk analysis and the drawing up of control plans at the site of project implementation was examined and the evaluations of project applications carried out by independent evaluators were assessed.
The examination of the control system included a review of the administrative and on-the-spot checks that allowed for the approval of e.g. deliveries of goods and co-financed services, the eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement, as well as the compliance of the disbursement of these funds and the related activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.
Significant deficiencies were found by the SAO audit in the area of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information about the grants provided.
In the area of project evaluation and approval, a risk of non-transparency of this process has been identified.
Further shortcomings were identified in the setting of monitoring indicators and in the setting of the irregularity reporting system.
Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and management system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.
The irregularities identified by NIK relating to the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of the applicable laws and rules were not assessed as significant.
These irregularities had an impact only on individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the entire OPPS CR-POL.
Despite the identified discrepancies, NIK assessed the functioning of the system positively.
B. Evaluation of project results
The audit did not reveal any discrepancy between the indicators and targets set for each project and those defined by the operational programme.
In all audited projects, the expected results were achieved, the funded activities were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set in the project applications of the operational programme were met.
The audit conclusions are in line with the result of the survey of the societal evaluation of project implementation described below.
An important aspect that the SAO and NIK addressed in their conclusions is the limited possibility of objective evaluation of the performance of the projected results of individual projects with regard to the objectives of individual projects as well as the objectives of the entire operational programme.
On initiative A public opinion survey was conducted by the Supreme Audit Chamber and was carried out in the summer of 2013 at the place of implementation of the projects selected in the joint control sample.
The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).
In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the survey was conducted on both sides of the border between 2 820 respondents, both for the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project implemented by Polish project partners and for the Czech public in relation to the part of the project implemented in the Czech Republic.
The survey covered in particular the appropriateness, quality, information exchange, use of funds and the social function of the projects, including the investments made.
The number of respondents for each project is given in Annex 2.
The assessment of the survey responses indicated that the overall societal rating of the projects was good at 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), which means that the results of the projects were viewed positively by the majority of respondents both in terms of the objectives and the other parameters set out in the project applications.
According to the respondents, the projects examined fulfilled the criteria expressed in the operational programme.
Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and the renewal of contacts between residents of the border region.
On the other hand, the overall assessment of the responses indicated a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of the objectives/parameters (actual impact rate) and the level expected by the respondents.
This difference relates to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.
The results of the survey were in line with the views of the participants in the panel discussions (target groups) carried out in the framework of the NIK audit on the Polish side, who pointed to the need to implement the projects and confirmed their positive public acceptance and the fulfilment of the expected results.
C. Evaluation of legality of audited projects
Beneficiaries of the aid were checked for compliance of the material and temporal implementation of the project with the timetable and content of the project application, fulfilment of the stated objectives and purpose of the project, fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, management of changes in projects, handling of potential project revenues, fulfilment of the obligation to keep separate accounting records of project transactions, compliance with the prohibition of financing projects from other EU sources, implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its conditions, fulfilment of the obligatory publicity concerning in particular the dissemination of knowledge of sources of financing projects from the EU, compliance with the conditions of eligibility of project expenses, selection of contractors and verification of contracted services.
The total financial value of the deficiencies classified by the SAO and NIK as ineligible expenditure from EU funds was found to amount to € 85,094.
However, this amount did not exceed the materiality level established for the total volume of funds audited for the sample of projects.
Despite the detected irregularities, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of the selected projects positively.
In most cases, the commitments under the terms of the aid were duly implemented by the beneficiaries.
The funds earmarked for the implementation of the audited projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.
However, seven out of the eight beneficiaries audited by NIK were found to have irregularities in the implementation of their material and financial obligations.
These were individual cases of a non-systemic nature, involving particularly inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breaches of public procurement rules, but which had no impact on the choice of contractor or the delivery of contractually agreed works.
Only in one of all projects audited by NIK can an irregularity detected relating to non-compliance with reporting obligations be classified as ineligible expenditure, amounting to PLN 43 003 (of which EUR 8 231 financed by the ERDF).
On the other side of the border, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure amounting to CZK 2,098,053 in three of the 19 projects audited (of which EUR 76,863 were financed by the ERDF).
Irregularities included failure to deliver the materials and works paid or expenditure for the modernisation of a property owned by a person who was not linked to the project either as a beneficiary of the aid or as a project partner.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The joint recommendation of the SAO and NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system, especially with regard to the consistent setting of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.
In general, efforts should also be made to establish such indicators at programme and project level that allow a more reliable verification of compliance with the identified impacts.
Comments and recommendations resulting from inspections carried out on both sides of the border are included in separate audit conclusions of the SAO and NIK on CD.
COMMUNICATIONS
The report was drawn up in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the presidents of the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland.
Public works contracts and prevention of corruption
Joint report on the parallel audit performed by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)
Introduction and Overview
Public procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and the private sector.
The role of the State is to use public resources in the most efficient and economical way and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.
In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor for the success of the Single Economic Area.
The EU has set thresholds above which the contracting authority must meet certain requirements in order to guarantee a broad and unrestricted competitive environment across the EU.
EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.
The Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.
For public contracts below the EU thresholds, the regulation of their award remains a national competence.
Moreover, public procurement is prone to corruption with a consequent high potential for harm.
Therefore, contracting entities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and unfair favouritism (prevention of corruption).
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI – SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI – BRH) agreed to perform parallel audits in the area of procurement procedures and prevention of corruption in land and transport buildings.
Cooperation has also focused on the area of European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.
Controls included procurement below European thresholds in order to sanction the area of corruption prevention.
The audit findings of the two supreme audit institutions are summarised in a joint report, which is, among other things, addressed to international organisations such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Areas of control and institutions audited
The BRH assessment is based on the sweeping inspections of the above-mentioned areas carried out by the German building authorities responsible for federal transport and land construction between 2011 and 2012.
For example, highways and large-scale civil engineering projects were evaluated.
The BRH included findings from past inspections in the evaluation.
The SAO's evaluation is based on audits carried out during the years 2008 to 2012, which focused on construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, federal public procurement is mostly carried out by provincial building authorities.
In the Czech Republic, public procurement in the area of transport infrastructure is the responsibility of the state institutions for road and railway construction.
In the field of building construction, public procurement is carried out by entities receiving budget funds.
In both countries, the services of external experts are also used at the various stages of the procurement procedure.
The evaluation should take into account differences in public procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in both countries.
Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries
In Germany, the conduct of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and sub-statutory standards.
Procurement procedures limited to Germany shall be governed by budgetary law and the relevant administrative acts.
The internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.
Further details on the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are enshrined in the so-called procurement manuals of the federal government, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail with regard to legal precedents in the area of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation relating to contracts with a value above and below European thresholds.
The procurement law underwent substantial changes in 2012.
The new rules reinforced the transparency of procurement procedures, opened the way for more competition and reduced opportunities for corruption during procurement procedures.
Basic aspects of procurement law in both countries
As far as European procurement procedures are concerned, open and restricted procedures in particular need to be applied in both countries.
In Germany, contracts below the European threshold are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, restricted call for tenders, negotiated procedures), but these are practically identical to the above conditions for European procurement procedures.
Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates are invited on a European scale) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).
In open procedures and invitations to tender, any candidate may submit a tender.
Another important feature of German procurement law is support for small and medium-sized companies.
This is achieved mainly by dividing the total contract into commercially specific lots and by dividing it into sub-contracts.
By awarding contracts divided into these lots, the largest possible number of candidates is given the chance to participate in the procedure.
The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.
There are more than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees registered in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, the conditions of European procedures must be applied also in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.
An exception is the simplified below-threshold procedure, where the contracting authority may use less demanding procedures.
In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.
Current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between an open procedure and a restricted procedure.
There are 85,000 construction companies registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.
Total volume of contracting authorities' public works contracts and proportion of individual procedures in both countries
In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany amounted to EUR 7 675 billion.
CZK 1,138 billion (15 %) of which was accounted for by the share of public contracts which, in addition to those awarded by the federal government, included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities.
The total volume of projects of federal road and land constructions (without the construction of railways and water constructions) amounted to CZK 212.5 billion.
In 2011, the composition of federal works and transport contracts was as follows: 80,7 % open procedures and public calls; 12,7 % restricted management and calls;
6.6% negotiated procedures and direct award of contracts; 33.2% is the share of European procurement procedures.
The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic reached 118.6 billion CZK in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.
In 2009, the value reached CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37% of the total.
Structure of tender types in 2011: 65,1 % open procedures; 14,3 % restricted procedures; 9.5% negotiated procedures; 8.4% simplified procedures for low-threshold contracts; 2.7% other proceedings.
These figures include all public supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.
These figures show that: parallel controls in both countries were targeted at a substantial part of public procurement procedures; The prevention of corruption, which must always be taken into account in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; it is of open importance. Procurement procedures are of key importance.
Summary of main results
The SAO and BRH carried out parallel audits of European works contracts with an emphasis on the prevention of corruption in their respective countries.
The audits focused on comparing legislation in both countries and the EU and on the implementation of public contracts in the field of land and transport construction.
The following are the key findings:
The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into national law in both countries (points 1 and 3.1).
Preventing corruption is not only the aim of the EU directive, but also of the national procurement rules of the two countries, which differ partly in focus and detail.
In both countries, the essential requirement to be fulfilled by the tender documents is to include all the information needed for the preparation of the tenders.
The specification shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements restricting competition.
The procurement documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.
The problem in the Czech Republic is the lack of definition of the subject of the contract.
In Germany, the division of contracts into lots is required where possible in order to promote a competitive environment.
According to BRH’s findings, this requirement is respected in Germany.
The SAO audits showed that in the Czech Republic, very large public works in the field of road construction are awarded without being divided into parts or are divided into very significant parts. This may distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.
Such limitations of market potential may result in significant cost increases and risk unreliable price negotiations and impermissible agreements.
The legislation in both countries allows contracting authorities, under certain conditions, to subcontract additional works if the need arises after the conclusion of the contract (point 4.1).
In both countries, the requirements to correctly determine the type of procurement procedure are met.
In the Czech Republic, contracting entities are free to determine one of the open procurement procedures, namely the open procedure or the restricted procedure, in accordance with the applicable regulations.
German procurement and budget law rules enshrine the primacy of open procedures for both European tenders and national tenders, known as public calls for competition.
Open tendering procedures in both countries allow more bidders to submit a bid and also reduce the risk of corruption by making it more difficult for bidders to collude illegally.
At the same time, the best results in terms of value for money are achieved.
In the case of large contracts where the estimated total price reaches or exceeds the EU thresholds, the audited contracting entities have always launched a European procurement procedure.
The correct determination of the estimated value of the contract plays a very important role in the determination of the type of procurement procedure.
In Germany, databases are used for objective pricing of public works in which values are based on completed construction projects.
This is a sufficiently objective instrument.
In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the field of road construction but are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).
When awarding a works contract under European procurement procedures, it is necessary to publish prior information and a contract notice in order to strengthen competition by allowing candidates to prepare themselves in time for the submission of tenders.
As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.
In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).
There is a greater risk of manipulation when selecting candidates to take part in a restricted procurement procedure.
Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria shall be objective, non-discriminatory and published in good time.
Beyond EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries should, as far as possible, rotate candidates who are invited to participate in the procedure when selecting suppliers.
In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to prevent risks of manipulation.
In some cases, the audited contracting entities did not comply with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (point 4.4).
In both countries, contracting authorities must ensure during the procurement procedure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.
Any agreements between those candidates and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications must be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid restricting competition by means of illegal agreements.
In Germany, the measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.
However, the German contracting authorities audited did not meet this requirement in several cases (point 4.5).
In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.
The requirements for labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality of tenders are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (point 4.6).
The evaluation and evaluation of tenders is regulated procedurally in both countries.
The relevant German measures are more comprehensive but have not always been respected by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting entities transmitted their tenders to third parties for consultation without prior assessment, without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.
The tenders were thus inadequately protected against subsequent manipulation (paragraph 4.7).
For reasons of legal protection, tenderers must be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.
This legal protection rule is also designed to prevent corruptive action.
The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.
Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).
The procurement documents for the audited contracting entities in both countries were not always complete or fully credible.
In the case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level were not always adequately respected in the minutes.
Moreover, some of the weaknesses identified reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the dossier.
Contracting entities in both countries mostly fulfilled their reporting obligations (paragraph 4.9).
Summary of the main principles of European procurement law and prevention of corruption
European procurement law
In order to ensure free competition in the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, a Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts to ensure the free movement of goods and services and a Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (the Remedies Directive), both of which were to be transposed into national law.
The EU's general procurement principles include in particular: the requirement for a competitive environment; the requirement for equal treatment or non-discrimination; the requirement for transparency.
EU procurement principles include The Directive on the coordination of public procurement procedures also includes provisions for construction projects with a total estimated value of € 5 million or more.
These provisions shall affect: the content of the procurement documents; the type of procurement procedure used; the publication of certain information before, during and after the procedure; compliance with the deadline for receipt of tenders; qualification requirements that tenderers may be required to meet; criteria for selecting the most suitable tender.
The legal protection of tenderers is governed by the Remedies Directive.
In the event of a potential breach of procurement law, tenderers may have the contracting authority's decision reviewed in accordance with the review procedures.
Both countries have transposed EU requirements into national legislation.
Preventing corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
There is no legal definition in either country of what corruption actually means.
In general, corruption is understood as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position for one's own benefit.
As a rule, this means that such abuse is instigated by those who benefit from it.
Corruption can be an obstacle to competition and can cause serious economic losses.
Overall corruption-related damages are estimated to amount to 5% of world economic output.
For the EU area, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.
Where a contracting authority is involved in a contract, agreements restricting competition or allowing dishonest conduct may undermine confidence in the integrity, ability and overall work of the public administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore an essential task for contracting authorities.
Practices and procedures must be monitored, particularly in areas particularly prone to corruption, so that adequate measures can be taken to prevent it.
Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls can substantially reduce the vulnerability of the decision-making process to corruption.
As a rule, the award of works contracts is considered to be an area particularly prone to corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, in particular active and passive bribery, receiving and offering significant benefits.
The German Federal Government has issued a manual of recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration, according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process, outside the risk analysis: the priority of open procurement; the principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; the separation of the planning, procurement and accounting phases; accurate and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.
In addition, other measures having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of the procurement law.
In 2011, the competent Federal Ministry of Information Technology introduced a system to monitor the procurement of federal roads.
Using this system, data such as estimated costs, total value of the contract and involvement of private design firms can be fully recorded and analysed in order to identify potential irregularities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, and the level of labour or civil law is also an option.
The legal requirement of transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of preventing corruption.
Anti-corruption measures in this area have been set out by the government in the "Government Anti-Corruption Strategy 2011-2012", which has been updated for 2013 and 2014.
Some of these measures have been incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and subsequent implementing regulations.
The new legislation includes the following basic provisions: lowering the thresholds for small-scale contracts; the obligation of prior notification by the contracting authority, including the justification for the contract; the prohibition on limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and the abolition of the general possibility to limit the number of tenderers by drawing lots; obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; obligation to publish actual lists of subcontractors.
Results of checks relating to the subsequent stages of the procurement procedure
Procurement documents
The procurement documents shall contain all the information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their tenders in an appropriate form.
In particular, the documentation shall make it possible to prepare the tender price.
In order to do so, tenderers must not be exposed to risks which they could not have anticipated.
The tender documents shall contain, in particular, the specifications, the requirements for proving the qualifications of the tenderers and the criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.
European law requirements and prevention of corruption
In particular, European law contains requirements relating to technical specifications.
Specifications must be as restrictive of competition as possible and all interested parties must have equal access to them.
The specification shall be neutral.
Requirements for specific specific products are permitted in the tender documents on a very limited scale.
The basic principle of preventing corruption is that tender documents should not contain requirements that could restrict competition.
Furthermore, the documentation should avoid ambiguities or inaccurate data which create room for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.
The basic principle is that specifications should be given in general terms without reference to a specific product or brand.
The specifications shall specify the deliveries and services required and detail the number of units of work and deliveries.
In normal cases, prices should be stated by units of works or supplies (e.g. in CZK/m or in CZK/item).
It is permissible to define the required works in terms of their functionality only in exceptional cases.
In principle, the rule is that the specifications must be drawn up completely and unambiguously.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include works and supplies the necessity of which is not obvious.
Reimbursement in the form of lump sums or time worked should be avoided wherever possible.
These parts of the procurement documents shall exclude speculation and manipulation based on ambiguous specifications.
The specifications must enable each tenderer to prepare its tender with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender shall be published only when the procurement documents are complete.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for contracting authorities to award construction contracts in lots.
A contracting authority may divide a contract into several separate lots where the nature of the subject-matter of the contract so permits.
In Germany, the rule of dividing works into lots is required, either quantitatively (partial deliveries) or according to specific criteria (specialised lots).
This allows SMEs to compete, increases the number of potential bidders and makes price fixing more difficult.
This type of award is usually considered the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.
In the Czech Republic, tender documents must contain evaluation criteria in national and European procurement procedures.
In doing so, the tenderer should be informed comprehensively and exhaustively of the criteria on the basis of which its tender will be evaluated.
In Germany, the requirement to include evaluation criteria in the notification applies only to European invitations to tender.
In national procurement procedures, it is necessary to include evaluation criteria only in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.
If the tender documents are prepared by authorised independent experts, the German regulations require that any information which would help to identify the specific firms, architects or designers involved be excluded from the tender documents.
This is to prevent individual construction firms from obtaining any additional information or other undue competitive advantage without the contracting authority's knowledge through contacts with these independent experts.
This is also the reason why independent experts may not publish tender documents and make them available for screening.
The contracting authority is the single point of contact for construction companies.
The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.
In the case of large construction projects, additional works or modifications of existing works are almost always necessary after the original contract is concluded.
The legislation of both countries allows the award of a multi-work contract within a certain limit to the same contractor without the need to publish and conduct a new procurement procedure.
The volume of additional works under both European and German legislation may not exceed 50 % of the original value of the contract.
In addition, the additional works must be necessary and specific to the main contract.
In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied for the award of additional works.
This may entail the risk of a greater time lag in the execution of the contract and the possible inclusion of a new entity in an already running project.
If the contract for additional works is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision that prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of the modified works or additional works.
The calculations shall be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.
In addition to extra work, less work may occur during construction, i.e. work that was not needed.
In the Czech Republic, less work and more work cannot be compensated for.
Main control findings
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In isolated cases, the specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards, but these have since been replaced by EU standards.
In some cases, the specifications included information requiring a particular brand name, e.g. for the resistance system of public signs, to prevent water ingress or for noise barriers, although this was not necessary.
In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.
Quantity specifications broken down into items
The BRH did not, in a single case of control of procurement procedures, notice non-compliance with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supplies and services under the quantitative specifications broken down into lots.
Completeness of specifications
In most of the audited cases, the tender documents were fully prepared before the announcement of the call for tenders.
In various cases, however, documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure when changes in the headings or timetable had to be taken into account.
In rare cases, the tender documents included works and supplies for which the need was uncertain.
One tender dossier for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.
Division of contract and award criteria
In many cases, the required justification for not dividing deliveries into lots has not been demonstrated.
The BRH did not find any shortcomings in the criteria for evaluating tenders prior to the award of the contract.
Inclusion of the names of authorised independent experts
Many of the documents mentioned the authorised experts involved.
The names appeared on the opening pages of the documents or on the plans or attached opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact the explicitly appointed architect with their questions on the procurement procedure.
In the case of building projects, these cases were found mainly in the tender documents, where self-employed experts were entrusted with the elaboration of the specifications.
The contracting authorities indicated that they did not have sufficient staffing capacity to examine the tender documents in detail.
SAO
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 apartments, the reference was directly to specific manufacturers and product brands.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of other similar types of products, nor did it give reasons why it required the supply of specific products.
For the construction of university facilities, the tender documents included references to specific business names and specific product designations.
Overview of specifications and sub-specifications
For the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define in the procurement documents the quantity and type of works, supplies or services required in the statement of assessment and defined only the enclosed space in cubic metres as the unit of measurement for each building.
Completeness of specifications
During the procurement procedure for the construction of the ring road, the tender documents for the restricted procedure were amended four times between August and September 2009.
This was due to changes in the project documentation caused by the extension of the scope of the contract and the change of technical conditions.
In the case of the construction of social buildings, the tender documentation had defects that forced the creation of additional works (lack of precise focus, lack of sufficient construction technical research, lack of drawings).
In the tender documents for the construction of the large library, the interior elements were mentioned only descriptively, without specifying qualitative requirements for the products.
Supply of interior equipment was provided by subcontractors, who purchased some above-standard and very expensive equipment.
Parts and criteria for the award of the contract
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to award the contract in parts.
Analysis of three major road constructions during the construction of the road circuit showed that when they were awarded in an open procedure in parts (separately after selected buildings), it was possible to achieve savings of up to CZK 790 million from the achieved public procurement price of CZK 15,508 million.
For example, when awarding six buildings as a separate part of a public contract, savings of EUR 62.5 million could be achieved.
CZK, i.e. 25% of the contracted price and with the award of 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract, a saving of CZK 287.8 million, i.e. also 25%, could be achieved.
When constructing roads, the contracting authority laid down in the procurement documents qualification criteria which restricted the participation of small suppliers in the procurement procedure.
In the tender conditions of the open tender for a contractor for one construction of a motorway, the contracting authority required, among other things, the contractor's practice of implementing at least three road constructions with a financial volume of more than CZK 700 million each, completed or put into operation during the last five years.
There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completion of buildings over CZK 700 million in the last five years.
The public contract for the supply of another motorway construction in the open procedure included six separate constructions for which the contracting authority requested a minimum annual volume of works in the last three years of EUR 12 billion.
Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. € 2.5 billion out of € 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008–2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually either in form of consortium.
In 46 contracts for a total of CZK 13.2 billion, there were only two or even one bidder.
The SAO pointed out that limiting market potential can lead to a large increase in costs.
Multi-Work Area
In two cases, the contracting authority did not conclude a written contract for the supply of additional works during the construction of the ring road and did not award the additional works by any of the procedures specified in the Act.
The value of non-approved additional works in one case was CZK 1,591.4 million (increase of 21%) and in the other case CZK 4,135.8 million (increase of 91%).
The cause of the additional works was mainly the ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.
In the case of the construction of university facilities, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documents certain works and supplies whose necessity for the completion and approval of the construction was known to it at the time of the award of the contract.
For these works and supplies he concluded amendments to the contract with the contractor of the work with an increase in the price, in a negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of additional works exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.
In connection with the construction of the Palace of Justice, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a procurement procedure.
During the construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by CZK 50.5 million.
The unit prices of the additional works, determined without competition, were significantly higher than comparable works carried out by the same supplier.
Other findings
The SAO found on a selected sample of buildings that the average construction cost of one kilometre of a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic is CZK 355.0 million.
According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometre section of a four-lane motorway is CZK 260.0 million.
This comparison suggests that acquiring a motorway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary
The legal provisions relating to the tender documents are almost identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of European law.
The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and the prevention of corruption.
The specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow interested parties to calculate the costs and prepare their bids.
Moreover, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to award additional works.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions on procurement documents are complemented by additional rules to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for carrying out manipulations.
Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, greater transparency is achieved by publishing the award criteria.
Specification requirements are mostly met in both countries.
In some cases, however, shortcomings have been identified which could lead to a reduction of competition.
The current rule in Germany requiring the division of large construction projects into lots seems appropriate for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.
The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, awarding contracts for large-scale projects without awarding them in parts or dividing them into large-scale projects can limit the number of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.
As a result of the strict requirement for bidder references applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of bidders for road construction works, public contracts are awarded only to a small number of bidders and small and medium-sized companies have no chance to compete.
The limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price fixation and other illegal arrangements.
Regarding the award and reimbursement of additional contracts for additional works or modified works, regulatory approaches differ between the two countries.
Where the value of the additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50 % of the value of the original contract, the additional works may be awarded without a call for tenders and a contract notice.
The Czech Republic has a stricter limit of 20%.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded by contracting authorities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If the 20 % limit is exceeded, the additional works must be awarded on the basis of a new procurement procedure.
Dividing works into parts avoids restricting competition and consequent adverse consequences.
Determination of the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU limits
By specifying the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the range of potential suppliers that will be admitted to the tender.
The contracting authority may leave the range of potential suppliers unlimited or may limit the range according to the criteria specified.
A European procurement procedure must be conducted for large-scale design works with a value that reaches or exceeds the EU thresholds.
European law requirements and prevention of corruption
In choosing the type of procedure, the contracting authority must, in particular, comply with the requirements of European law relating to the competitive environment and transparency.
If the estimated total cost of the contract for the requested works reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million ($125 million), an open or restricted procurement procedure at European level is always required.
In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue is permitted.
If the construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the European procurement procedure by issuing a national tender if the total value of the relevant part is below the threshold of 1.0 million € (25 million CZK) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the value of the whole contract estimate.
Dividing up a building project or deliberately estimating its cost too low in order to avoid a fundamental obligation to launch a European tender is not acceptable.
Choosing the type of procedure is very important for preventing corruption, as reducing competition substantially increases the risk of manipulation.
Therefore, a detailed justification of the chosen type of procedure, in particular in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law, is an important part of the tender documentation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented EU legal requirements on procurement procedures and limits in their national legislation.
Different provisions
The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures also for procurement procedures at national level.
Open and restricted procedures can always be chosen, while other types of proceedings are only allowed if the conditions laid down by law are met.
Unlike the Czech legislation, the relevant German legislation on budgetary law and the principles of prevention of corruption prefers open procedures or a public invitation to participate in the procedure.
Other types of proceedings, including restricted proceedings, are permitted only in exceptional cases where legislation so permits.
Such exceptions must be justified and documented.
The principle of preference for an open procedure is intended to ensure that a limitation of competition is avoided as far as possible and that the opportunity for manipulation (pre-selected specific candidates) is limited.
In Germany, this principle of public procurement is central to preventing corruption.
A correct estimation of the expected contract price is an important basis for deciding on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.
In estimating the costs of building projects, contracting entities in Germany can rely on the budget and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.
These have been compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, inter alia, standard cost values for building types, building units, building components and partial works.
On the basis of such standard cost values it is possible to estimate the value of the contract, planned project or works.
Only a few building authorities in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.
However, the database is expected to be expanded at national level.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable buildings to determine the expected costs of public contracts for ground construction.
In many cases, the determination of costs is based on an estimate of the entity financing the project or on the value of the resources available to that entity.
Measures for standardisation are still at an early stage.
Under the 2011-2012 Anti-Corruption Programme, the relevant ministries are to develop a database on the current prices of standardised commodities.
The application of a price system for the determination of the expected price of a contract is determined by a new regulation ordering the detailed definition of the subject-matter of the contract.
The pricing system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly work, materials and products and other data in order to calculate the necessary costs and establish unit prices.
The Ministry of Transport has issued normative prices for transport constructions in order to check them, which are regularly updated.
The database is designed to determine the price of the project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the next stages of construction preparation.
Main control findings of BRH
Selection of procurement procedure
The audited contracting authorities generally awarded contracts by open procedure or by means of a public call for participation, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.
In 2011, the share of public tenders in the total volume of federal building projects in the field of building construction was 59.5%.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public tendering was not sufficiently justified.
In the case of the blanket check, BRH found, based on information collected from more than 16 000 procedures, that the restricted procedure has a clear disadvantage compared to the public procedure and the public call and that the restricted procedures also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to the BRH study, tender prices in restricted and negotiated procedures were between 6 % and 10 % higher than in public tenders.
Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Regional Court of Auditors confirmed differences in value for money obtained in public and restricted procedures.
A study by the Ministry of Construction even found that prices in restricted procedures were twice as high as prices in public procedures.
Compliance with EU limits
For projects with an estimated total contract value of more than €5 million (CZK 125 million), audited contracting authorities usually prepared procurement plans indicating which works would be awarded in the European procurement procedure and which in the national procedure.
According to the procurement plans, the proportion of works awarded under European rules has always exceeded 80 % of the total works.
There was no case of circumvention of the requirement for a European procedure in the form of an excessively low cost estimate.
However, in some cases the minimum proportion for pan-European management was not reached due to a calculation error.
In the course of carrying out the works, some contracting authorities have unlawfully changed the procurement plan.
They did not provide any justification for these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of European governance would subsequently be respected.
As a rule, the proportion of European procedures by project accounts was lower than that laid down in the procurement plan.
If the expected values of the construction project contracts exceeded the European limits, the contracting authorities did not apply the European procedure to all individual parts with a value exceeding €1 million ($25 million).
Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure without giving any valid reasons for the need for a derogation from the requirement.
SAO
Choice of procurement procedure type
In the case of several major construction projects (e.g. construction of a road section, facilities for a major sporting event and construction of apartments), the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, although these sub-contracts were of the same or similar nature.
The split-up reduced the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded under a less demanding regime or even outside the statutory regime.
Methods for calculating the estimated price
Price normatives applicable to road construction projects have not been an effective tool for setting the expected price.
They were based on prices quoted in the finalised procedures, which were however subject to both inefficiencies and excessive profit for suppliers.
The SAO found that actual prices for three parts of the road circuit were approximately 37% lower than these price norms.
The Ministry of Transport is to update the standards not only in relation to prices from the past, but also in relation to other comparable markets and price developments.
For land-based buildings, the estimated price was based on the project budget carried out by the architects or on an estimate by the investor.
The actual price then differed significantly from the estimated price.
The estimated cost of building a large library was twice as high as the contract price, but during the implementation it increased by CZK 54 million, i.e. by 27%.
Similarly, for the construction of the depository of this library, the contract price was 33% lower than the expected price.
In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the expected price and increased further during the implementation.
In the case of the construction of a large library, this was by CZK 400 million, i.e. by 22%. In the case of the construction of the Palace of Justice, the actual price increased disproportionately during the construction (by 139 %) compared to the increase in functional areas (by only 12 %).
Summary
Both countries have implemented European provisions on the choice of the type of procurement procedure and on compliance with European limits in their national legislation, so that the respective national regulations of both countries are almost identical.
However, the principle of public procedures in Germany is stricter than the European regulation and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.
Compared to a narrower procurement procedure, a public procurement procedure or a call for tenders gives the possibility to a larger number of competitors to participate in the procurement procedure.
These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of bids that guarantee the best value for money effect.
Corruption prevention is significantly reinforced as the pool of candidates is not limited by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, which gives room for manipulation and fixing of prices between tenderers.
The studies confirmed the advantages of the German provision on the preference of open procedures or public calls for participation.
Czech law allows contracting authorities to award contracts in open or restricted procedures.
However, the latest legislation of the Public Procurement Act introduces a prohibition for contracting authorities to limit the number of tenderers in restricted procedures.
The restricted procedure has now come very close to an open procedure.
In Germany, the requirement of preference for an open procedure or a public call for competition is largely fulfilled by the contracting authority, while in the Czech Republic some projects were awarded in violation of the law in order to circumvent the requirement to choose the appropriate type of procurement procedure.
However, in the case of some projects carried out in Germany, European limits were not respected, resulting in a lack of a minimum share in pan-European procedures.
In the Czech Republic, a satisfactory system facilitating the correct calculation of the expected costs of construction works and projects has not yet been implemented.
Where appropriate, contracting entities should ensure, through more extensive controls, that the requirements for the selection of the type of procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are fulfilled or should create the conditions necessary to allow the correct calculation of expected costs.
Preliminary information and notice of initiation
In cases where contracts are awarded in the framework of a European procedure, the contracting authority must publish a procurement report.
Preliminary information and tender notices are an important basis for European competition.
European law requirements and prevention of corruption
By means of prior notices, the contracting authority must indicate the essential specifications of the envisaged projects.
Prior notifications are required for projects for which the total cost estimate is equal to or greater than the European limit and when the contracting authority wishes to reduce the time limit for the submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.
The contracting authority is obliged to publish a contract notice with detailed information for all public contracts requiring a European procedure.
The information shall be binding on the contracting authority after publication.
The notice shall contain, inter alia, the specifications, the time limits for the procedure and for the completion of the contract, the specific requirements and selection criteria and their weightings.
The Common Procurement Vocabulary shall be used to describe the subject of the contract.
Preliminary information and contract notices are published in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the contracting authority.
In order to avoid discrimination against foreign candidates, notices at national level should not contain any additional information and should not be published before the text of the notice is sent to the Publications Office of the EU.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the advance notice may distort competition or even facilitate manipulation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented the EU provisions on prior information and procurement notices in their national legislation.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published for contracts for which a European procedure is not required.
The procurement procedure may not start earlier than one month after the dispatch of the prior information notice.
Provisional disclosure may be waived only in exceptional cases.
In Germany, prior information is not required in cases where a European procedure is not necessary.
In the case of national proceedings, the public notice must be published on the federal government website and, where appropriate, in the press.
In the case of restricted procedures without competition between participants, the notice must be published if the estimated contract price is equal to or higher than €25,000 ($625,000).
Advance notifications must explain all the planned parts of the project.
This is an important requirement given the number of small orders in Germany.
The division of projects into smaller parts is less frequent in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.
Main control findings
BRH
Prior notice
The contracting authorities published a prior notice of projects which included works to be awarded in the European procedure.
In some open procedures, they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between the sending of the pre-notification and the sending of the contract notice was less than 52 days.
In the case of other abridged procedures, the annual time limits for prior information had expired and should have been reinstated.
In many cases, the prior notification did not indicate the anticipated division of the works into several parts.
Procurement notice
Some notifications contained codes from the Common Vocabulary which deviated from the content of the pre-notification or did not specify precisely the work to be carried out.
In rare cases, notifications at national level included more information, e.g. on deadlines, or were published before the notice was published in the Official Journal of the EU.
Ex-ante transparency
One contracting authority hired an external company to publish a national notice.
It published a notice on its platform, the use of which was subject to a fee.
However, the contracting authority did not check whether the company had to comply with the requirement to forward the notice to a free online government portal.
The sample showed that only a third of the notifications were actually published on the government portal.
SAO
Procurement notice
In the case of the construction of a waste water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not set out in the tender notice for the contractor the criteria according to which it would reduce a large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure.
The manner in which the tenders were selected (reduced) for evaluation was not substantiated by the contracting authority.
Reducing the number of bids was allowed by previous legislation.
For the construction of a ring road, the contracting authority did not define, in the notice of initiation of the restricted procedure or in the qualification documents, the values by which it would assess the extent to which the qualification criteria were met or the number of candidates to be invited.
The contracting authority assessed the fulfilment of the qualification as having been fulfilled by all six candidates in the restricted procedure, but excluded one of them on the grounds that he had finished in the last sixth place.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent as it did not publish in advance information on what qualification data would be evaluated and how.
Publication of calls
In the case of building modifications in former military sites, the contracting authority unlawfully failed to publish a written invitation to tender.
Conclusions and recommendations/summary
The two-stage information process with prior information and the publication of a notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the requirements of transparency and strengthening the competitive environment in European procedures.
By extending the obligation to publish prior information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and reinforcing this obligation in Germany for restricted procedures, both countries have increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.
Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures
Contrary to the open procedure, limited procurement procedures do not allow the participation of all potential candidates who would be interested.
In restricted procedures, the contracting authority shall first select the potential suppliers that will be asked to submit a tender.
European law requirements and prevention of corruption
EU provisions allow for a limit on the number of applicants in European restricted procedures.
However, the restricted procedure requires at least five tenderers to be invited to submit a tender and, in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential tenderers must be invited.
In any event, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently large to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and published in advance.
The selection of potential candidates to be invited is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. the preferences of some of them.
Reducing competition to a few bidders can make it easier for them to collude.
This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.
Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and ensure that it has effective control in order to ensure that the procedure is transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The provisions for the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the requirements of the European Directive, contracting entities should reward the tenderers they invite to submit a tender.
Nor is it permissible to restrict competition from a regional point of view.
Contracting entities shall document and justify the selection of tenderers and the selection process.
Different provisions
In Germany it is required to invite at least three candidates in the case of a restricted procedure and several suitable candidates in the case of a negotiated procedure.
Except in two cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow to limit the number of candidates approached in the case of restricted and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the ‘four eyes’ principle must be respected when selecting candidates.
While one worker proposes a list, another must substantially modify the proposal, e.g. by removing a proposed candidate or appointing another.
This is intended to avoid a situation where an individual can definitively identify the pool of candidates who will take part in the procedure.
In the absence of such a provision, far-reaching illegal collusion between participants is allowed.
The list of tenderers to be invited to submit a tender shall be confidential and shall not be divulged.
Authorised independent experts are also obliged to do so.
There is no similar measure or measure for the confidential treatment of the list of candidates in the Czech Republic.
Under the German provisions, they may not nominate external companies but may submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is no such requirement in the Czech Republic.
Main control findings
BRH
Number of Leads
Except in a few cases, the requirement to reach a minimum number of candidates was met.
An analysis of almost 7 000 works contracts with a value below the national threshold showed that, in the case of restricted procedures, contracting authorities invited an average of 6,6 potential tenderers and, in the case of direct negotiated procedures, an average of 4,4 tenderers.
Change of suppliers and regional restrictions
In particular, in the area of building construction, the contracting authorities did not change the range of applicants interviewed, as they had good experience with those with whom they had previously cooperated.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of a non-public procedure, they should ensure that they reach out to tenderers whose suitability they have already ascertained beforehand.
Although there was no evidence of unlawful regional restrictions, the pool of bidders in the non-public procedure included a larger proportion of regional bidders than was the case in the public procedures.
The contracting authorities explained this by the low level of the contract compared to the public procurement procedure and the high cost of travel for potential tenderers.
Cross-checking principle and proposals of self-employed professionals
The contracting authorities largely ignored the obligation to amend the list of candidates proposed by the self-employed professionals.
They argued in particular that there was a lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable candidate.
In many cases, the records did not show who had proposed the candidate who had been asked to participate in the procedure.
An examination of some samples showed that the list of potential candidates was drawn up by self-employed professionals and accepted by the contracting authority without changes.
As a result, contracting authorities did not adequately protect themselves from potential manipulation.
Confidentiality of the treatment of lists of potential candidates
One contracting authority kept a list of candidates for invitations to tender in a database to which all employees had access at any time.
This allowed manipulation or unauthorised disclosure of the names of presumed or admitted bidders, who could then agree on the price.
Documentation
The dossier gave reasons for the selection of candidates only in a few cases.
SAO
Criteria for the selection of candidates
During the construction of the road circuit, the applicants did not have information about what data about their qualifications would be evaluated and how.
For the action related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the tender notice for participation in the restricted procedure did not set out criteria for limiting the number of tenderers.
All eight candidates fulfilled the qualifications, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority restricted participation in the procurement procedure.
The Commission then selected the candidates by random drawing of lots, which was legal at the time.
That procedure should already have been mentioned as a criterion in the contract notice.
Summary
In view of the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning bidder in restricted procurement procedures, both countries have put in place special measures to prevent undue restrictions of competition.
The German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by means of so-called cross-checking (the four-eyes principle), by maintaining the confidentiality of the list of candidates and by prohibiting external companies from making proposals for the selection of candidates.
The Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with a view to manipulation, in particular by an unlimited number of bidders.
However, the audit found that some of the above rules were not sufficiently applied and that an inadmissible restriction of the pool of candidates was not prevented in some cases.
Contracting entities are obliged to completely eliminate these shortcomings.
Submission of tenders
The stage of the procurement procedure where potential tenderers can draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documents they have received starts with the publication of the tender information and/or the invitation to tenderers.
Until the date on which the envelopes are opened, potential tenderers may submit their tenders to the contracting authority in order to compete for the award of the contract.
European law requirements and prevention of corruption
EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.
The contracting entity shall follow the national rules governing this stage of the procedure and avoid potential manipulation.
Those provisions relate in particular to organisation and control.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The principle is that tender documents on the basis of which potential suppliers prepare their bids must always be sent by the contracting authority.
Design offices with a management interest should not fulfil this role.
The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.
In the event of confusion in the procurement documents or where further questions arise, only the contracting authority may supply information to tenderers.
The design offices responsible for drawing up the tender documents may not provide any information.
During this entire phase, any contact between the design office and the tenderers must be avoided.
They must remain anonymous throughout the course, as allowing them to be contacted may adversely affect competition.
Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronic submissions must be encrypted.
Different provisions
In Germany, the contracting authority may entrust insured suppliers of external services with the printing and distribution of documentation, and their employees must be bound to observe confidentiality.
In Germany, tenders received must be marked with the date of receipt and sent directly and immediately in their original state (sealed) to the official in charge of their safekeeping.
That worker shall have no interest in the procurement procedure.
Tenders received must be locked until the opening date of the envelopes.
In the Czech Republic, tenders received are marked with a serial number.
The contracting authority shall draw up a report setting out the details of the contest, including the number of the tender and information on the preparation and receipt of the tender.
There are no specific provisions on the safekeeping of tenders.
Main control findings
BRH
BRH checked the assignment of the administration building.
Submission of tender documents
The audited contracting authorities of the building administration sent out the tender documentation either directly or entrusted its printing and distribution to an external company.
Self-employed workers did not send any documentation.
Information to be provided to tenderers
For the inquiry and information part of the procurement documents, the contracting authority did not follow the separate planning rule from the procurement procedure.
Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not mention the names of his contact staff in the documentation, but rather the staff of the project management department.
Some tendering notices even included the names of firms or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of the tender documents.
In isolated cases, tenderers who made enquiries during the procurement procedure did not receive identical information.
Menu Labelling
For the contracting authorities, all tenders received were marked with a stamp and an acknowledgement of receipt.
However, in some cases in negotiated procedures, tenders were accepted by self-employed professionals, in breach of the one-building rule for the prevention of corruption.
Custody of the tenders
Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.
For one contracting authority, tenders were temporarily placed in an open slot in the mailroom to which all employees had access.
Another contractor placed the box in the corridor without constant supervision, and a portion of the bids dropped into the box stayed there overnight.
The opening of the box was wide and unsecured, making it accessible not only to employees.
SAO
The SAO did not find any shortcomings in this area.
Summary
In both countries, rules are laid down to prevent contacts, in particular between interested companies and design offices cooperating in the procurement process, throughout the whole process.
Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all tenderers.
Rules to prevent manipulation and corruption are appropriate for the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of tenders.
In Germany the relevant requirements are somewhat more elaborated than in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the control records collected showed breaches of the rules in certain areas.
These irregularities can easily be corrected.
Opening Envelopes
Opening Envelopes
During the opening of the envelopes, tenders that have been closed are opened, their contents are read and published.
The period during which a tenderer is bound by his tender shall begin at the time of expiry of the time-limit for submitting the envelopes or opening them and shall end at a time-limit specified by the contracting authority.
European law requirements and prevention of corruption
European legislation does not contain any specific provisions on the opening of envelopes.
However, national laws and regulations contain extensive requirements to protect bids and competitors during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement procedure.
The principles of ‘multiple eyes’, transparency and trustworthiness of the process of opening envelopes are intended to prevent manipulation and modification of tenders already submitted.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The opening of envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.
Compliance with the "multiple eyes" principle is intended to prevent individuals from covertly manipulating offers.
Applicants may be present when the envelopes are opened.
When opening, all envelopes must be placed in front of the chairman of the commission and are opened one by one.
Tenders received late shall not be taken into account.
In order to ensure transparency in the opening of envelopes, this stage, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing. The record must show, inter alia, the names of the tenderers and the prices offered.
The minutes must be read and signed by the group leader.
The minutes may also be signed by the candidates present.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, a committee is set up for opening envelopes.
The participation of independent experts is permitted.
The members of the Commission may also be responsible for the subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. the evaluation of the tenders.
In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of the manager and the registrar.
The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.
The manager and, in the case of civil engineering, the recorder may not be involved in the preparatory phase (preparation of tender documents), may not decide on the award of the contract and may not be a member in the subsequent processing (management) of the contract.
The German regulations require that the record of the opening of envelopes include not only the offer prices, but also all information on discounts and special (unusual) signs, such as damaged envelopes on receipt or late receipt of an offer.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the quotation prices, the written record must also contain an indication of the language of the bid and the signature authority of the bidder.
German law requires all parts of opened envelopes to be marked in order to prevent subsequent changes.
Tenders, usually marked by perforation with a date, must be kept confidential (secret) after the opening of the envelopes and may be made available only to persons who process them.
Similar measures do not exist in the Czech Republic.
If a single tender is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope may not be opened and the tenderer must be informed immediately.
In Germany, they do not have this arrangement, and if a single offer is accepted, it is opened and evaluated.
Main control findings
BRH
Cross-checking principle
During the opening of the envelopes, the contracting authorities adhered to the four-eyes principle.
There was always a manager and a recorder who was not assigned a different role.
In rare cases, however, for small negotiated procedures, natural persons have opened tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Envelope Opening Progress
The notes from the opening of the envelopes did not always document the process.
In some cases, tenders submitted late were not marked and in some cases signatures were missing.
Marking incoming menus
The contracting authorities marked the tenders with a date perforation, which was in accordance with the requirements.
Some of them had wrongly marked bids in the past, but changed their practice after the BRH had been alerted.

SAO
Deadline for receipt of tenders
For road repairs, for one action, the tenderer's bid was submitted to the contracting authority with a delay of one month and was nevertheless accepted by the contracting authority.
Summary
The essential elements of the provisions for opening envelopes are identical in both countries, taking into account the principle of ‘more eyes’ and the principle of transparency, and thus make it possible to substantially reduce the risk of corruption and manipulation.
The German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure.
Marking, safe storage and respect for the confidentiality of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent amendments to the tenders submitted.
In addition, the staff responsible for opening the envelopes may not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.
The findings, despite the discovery of some irregularities, confirm that the rules for opening envelopes are largely applied.
Assessment and evaluation of tenders
The contracting authority must examine and evaluate the tenders received within the time limit set.
At the same time, it must award the contract to the tenderer which best meets the award criteria in the tender.
European law requirements and prevention of corruption
EU law provides for a process of evaluation and evaluation of tenders in several steps:
The first step is to check candidates' suitability.
They must be in a good economic and financial position and possess the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.
Candidates who have ever been convicted of bribery or defrauding by a final judgment must always be excluded from procurement procedures.
The tenders of non-eliminated tenderers must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical appropriateness and value for money on the basis of previously published award criteria.
The contracting authority must identify the most economically advantageous tender and, in particular, examine all appreciably low price tenders.
Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and susceptible to manipulation.
For example, tenderers may be eliminated without a legitimate reason, or tenders that do not meet the requirements may be kept in competition.
The outcome of the evaluation may be wrongly influenced by the preference or disadvantage of a tenderer, thereby preventing the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.
The contracting authority must therefore take special measures in selecting the persons involved in the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements of good repute and technical knowledge.
They also need to make sure that the process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require a step-by-step examination and evaluation of tenders.
During the evaluation, the requirements to prove the suitability of the tenderers, the evaluation criteria and their weightings set out in the notice or the tender dossier may not be changed.
The criteria laid down for assessing the suitability of candidates may no longer be applied.
Further evaluation may only be carried out on the basis of evaluation criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view as to whether they are complete or do not include suspicious elements that might encourage manipulation.
If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they must be informed immediately.
Where the evaluation of the tenders reveals a disproportionately low tender price, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation before any elimination of its tender.
The reasons for the decision shall be transparently documented.
Different provisions
In Germany, tenderers must maintain confidentiality and only authorised persons may take part in the evaluation of tenders.
The mathematical accuracy of tenders may be reviewed only by the contracting authority.
Evaluation may only be entrusted to staff members who are not involved in the decision-making phase of the selection of the contractor or in the implementation phase of the project.
There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.
When external companies are entrusted with the examination and evaluation of bids, they must be aware that bids are confidential and respect that fact honestly.
They may only make proposals for decisions to the contracting authority.
In the Czech Republic, tenders must be examined and evaluated by a committee appointed by the contracting authority, which draws up a report proposing the conclusion of the contract.
However, in both countries the final decision depends on the contracting authority.
If, in Germany, the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If tenderers do not comply with this obligation, their tenders must be excluded.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide whether to give the tenderer the opportunity to complete the missing documents.
Failure to substantiate them will result in exclusion.
In Germany, it is necessary to examine not only the total price but also the unit prices.
Where the price structure of the tender indicates that prices for parts of the overall project have been estimated to be disproportionately high or low, tenderers must be asked for explanations.
If they do not provide an explanation and if the contracting authority can prove that the tender contains countervailing prices, such tenders must be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from submitting price calculations on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to the different parts of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.
In the Czech Republic, the total price of a work is evaluated and the prices of individual parts are not examined in detail.
Valuation compensation is not a reason to exclude a bid.
In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers a disproportionately high or low price.
Where one or more tenders differ in price by 10 % or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from other tenders, tenderers must prove that their tender has been credibly and convincingly calculated.
If they are unable to do so, the sponsor should exclude them.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure may be cancelled after a price review if only tenders with disproportionately low prices have been received and the tenderers have not substantiated those prices.
If the price of the tender is significantly higher than the contracting authority’s estimate, this does not constitute a ground for refusal to award the contract to the tenderer concerned (unlike German procurement law).
If there is a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority is obliged to report this immediately to the competent authority.
The latter must decide what action to take and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust authority or law enforcement authorities.
In addition, they must approve (e.g. if the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest bidder) whether the contract will be awarded at contract negotiations or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.
Czech rules do not regulate this area.
Main control findings
BRH
Assessment of suitability and award criteria
Most of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the relevant requirements.
In the case of certain recommendations made by self-employed potential suppliers, the contracting authorities did not themselves check the suitability of the tenderers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In some cases of procurement procedures, insufficient documentation was provided as to whether, in making the choice, the contracting authority took into account all published evaluation criteria or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.
Selection of interested parties and confidentiality of tenders
Some contracting authorities used the services of non-authorised persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of building authorities.
They were integrated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions that were to be performed exclusively by the contracting authority.
The contracting authorities tried to justify this by their insufficient human resources in the sector.
In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to examine offers of services from persons who were not formally bound to preserve the confidentiality of offers and to carry out their contractual obligations with due diligence.
As regards contracting authorities, there was generally no evidence of whether tenders held by self-employed professionals were available only to designated persons.
Examination and mathematical control of tenders
Some contracting authorities passed open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first carrying out the prescribed examination of tenders and mathematical examination and without documenting the results of such examination.
In the event of any intent to manipulate, third parties could make changes to tenders which could not be identified by the contracting authority.
Examination of the documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the tenders were not adequately identified or where data on prices and products were missing.
Performance audits
A sample check by one contracting authority revealed that in 75 % of procurement procedures, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10 % from the estimated costs.
One in 20 tendering procedures was cancelled due to inadequate tender prices.
In many cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation on the examination of tenders or on negotiations with tenderers for further clarification.
Detailed information was also missing in many cases, e.g. on unit prices of the most important invoiced items.
Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often cited as reasons for deviations.
The contracting authorities argued that the identification and demonstration of balancing prices was difficult.
In the case of one call for tenders, made by an entity outside the circle of standard contracting entities, a price 66 % lower than the initial cost estimate was offered.
No data were recorded on closer verification of cost or identification of reasons for deviations.
In clarifying this issue, the contracting authority did not find any indication of price dumping on the part of the tenderer to whom the contract might be awarded.
It was therefore not clarified whether the initial cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.
The contracting authority later classified the tenderer as a ‘low-cost company’ which was unable to meet either the quality requirements or the deadlines.
In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35 % higher than the initial cost estimate.
The contracting authority did not annul the procurement procedure, arguing that the tenderer in question could be presumed not to have based its pricing on unreasonably high costs.
Suspicion of irregularities
Two cases of irregularities were found in one contracting authority and reported to the firm responsible for technical supervision.
In one procurement procedure, two tenderers submitted tenders containing identical price calculations, which prompted the contracting authority to exclude both tenders.
The inspections did not reveal any significant shortcomings in the application of the other provisions.
SAO
Suitability check
For many building projects, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from participating in the procurement procedure even though they did not meet the requirements of the contracting authority as specified in the procurement specifications, or failed to provide evidence of qualification to the extent required, or, conversely, one contracting authority could not substantiate or explain the reason for the exclusion of a candidate who did.
Rating
In the case of the construction of a waste water treatment plant, it is true that the various evaluation criteria of the tendering procedure for the construction contractor were established, but they were not respected by the contracting authority during the procedure.
For the railway infrastructure development action, the weightings of the evaluation criteria for the award of the contract were not determined at the start of the procedure but only at the beginning of the evaluation.
For the road repair project, the assessment of the criterion of ‘shortening the construction period’ was not carried out correctly.
For the bidders in second and third place, the evaluation incorrectly indicated a greater reduction in construction time than indicated in their bids.
Documentation of the reasons for the selection of the tenderer
For the three housing promotion actions, the contracting authority did not substantiate the criteria on which it assessed the tenders received and how it selected the most suitable one.
Correctness of the selection of suppliers of small-scale contracts connected with the construction of a road circuit with an expected price of up to 500 000 CZK.
CZK could not be verified as the suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on the price and the date of performance, but no documents about these negotiations were made.
Summary
In both countries, the rules for the verification and evaluation of bids are in line with EU requirements.
However, they differ with regard to the specific management steps and the choice of the individuals involved in the procedure.
Unlike the Czech Republic, in Germany these steps of the procurement process are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially as regards the application of the cross-principle and the protection of tenders.
The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.
In both countries, it was found in some cases that the substantive steps of the process in the verification and evaluation of tenders were not documented at all and, if so, only partially.
The absence of control tools and transparency in decision-making during the examination and evaluation of tenders allows for manipulation.
The inspections showed serious deficiencies, such as the transmission of tenders to third parties without prior due diligence and the documentation of tenders by the contracting authority.
Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of functions related to the screening and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased control of measures to prevent increased possibility of manipulation are necessary.
When checking the validity of prices, the audited German contracting authorities did not in all cases use the complete set of available instruments and did not deal with their own price structure.
In the Czech Republic, shortcomings were found in the evaluation of the suitability of tenders and the use of evaluation criteria.
Completion of procurement procedure
After examination and evaluation of the tenders, the procurement procedure is concluded by the award of the contract or the cancellation of the procedure.
European law requirements and prevention of corruption
In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the award decision.
Suppliers shall have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request a review if appropriate.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The deadline of 10 days applies to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.
The contract may not be concluded before the expiry of that period or before the decision of the review procedure.
Where the review body rejects the complaint and upholds the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the application of procurement law reviewed by an independent court.
This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by swiftly implementing a procurement decision.
The contracting authority shall document the course of the procedure appropriately.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries implemented management on information obligations.
In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.
However, the latter cannot arbitrarily depart from the results of a properly carried out examination and evaluation.
The contracting authority shall conclude the contract within a specified period of time.
This is because, after that period, the tenderer is not bound by its tender.
The content of the contract must not deviate from the winning bid.
Unsuccessful tenderers are to be informed of the result in good time, indicating the reason why their bid was not accepted.
Cancellation of a procurement procedure is permissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in the tenders do not correspond to the specifications.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period before the conclusion of a contract of 10 or 15 days applies to both European and national procedures.
In Germany, an equivalent provision applies only to European procedures.
In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of a contract before a decision on its EU provisions and a review award has been taken.
In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure must be cancelled if a single tender has been received or if only one tender meets the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.
In Germany, a contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender fulfils the conditions set out in the procurement documents and is cost-effective.
Main control findings
BRH
The audits found few irregularities in the completion of the audited procurement procedures.
In some European proceedings, companies have received letters of authorisation before the expiry of the notification period, which may invalidate the contract.
Also, in several open procedures, empowerment letters contained modifications incompatible with the content of the tender, such as new deadlines.
In some cases, contracting authorities did not meet the deadlines for awarding the contract.
In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because a tenderer offering a price more than 50 % lower no longer wished to perform the contract at the price initially offered.
SAO
In one case, during the reconstruction and construction of a university, the contracting authority did not conclude a contract for work with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the tender of the selected tenderer.
For some road repair and maintenance actions, the construction of a motorway and a ring road, contracts were concluded later than provided for by law.
For building modifications in former military sites, the contracting authority sent a notice of selection of the most suitable tender to all tenderers after the statutory deadline had expired.
Summary
Both countries have implemented EU rules on the closure of procurement procedures.
Legal protection of unsuccessful candidates contributes to reducing corruption.
The Czech Public Procurement Act includes the legal protection institute even in cases of contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries it was found that the limited time limit for the conclusion of the contract was exceeded.
This may cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, contracting entities should eliminate such shortcomings in the conclusion of procurement procedures.
Documentation, notifications, information obligations
The procurement process, with all its different stages, relevant findings and decisions, including the relevant justification, shall be documented in a transparent manner.
The completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.
The data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.
European law requirements and prevention of corruption
The obligation to document procurement procedures is in line with the fundamental EU-wide requirement of transparency.
Only proper and time-relevant decision-making and reasoning documentation guarantees transparency in the procurement process and, in particular, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds European thresholds.
Appropriate documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to provide detailed reasons for individual decisions and their merits significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
In the case of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify the completion of the procedures to the EU’s Office of Official Publications within 48 days from the date of award of the contract.
The Office publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU and this also fulfils the transparency requirement.
The contracting authority must summarise the essential details of its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the competent national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission publishes annual statistics to provide an overview of the development of the single market in the construction sector.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully transposed into their national legislation the provisions of the European law on documentation and notification obligations.
The provisions on documentation and notification for European statistics are almost identical in both countries.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the award does not only apply to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.
The notification period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.
In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those that are mandatory under European law, applies only to restricted procedures exceeding the limit of €25,000 ($625,000) and direct procedures exceeding the limit of €15,000 ($375,000) including VAT.
Below this limit, only interested parties shall be informed.
Main control findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of assignments have not been fully documented.
The notification did not contain all the necessary information, such as the reasons for the delivery specifications and national rules.
In one procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it had concluded a contract with a tenderer whose tender did not contain the mandatory elements.
Some of the required records were also missing in several cases.
Publication of contract award
In the case of some European procedures, the contracting authority erred in publishing the notice.
In the case of several awards, there was no evidence of publication of the notice.
Notification obligation
The statistically verified files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent on time.
Preliminary transparency
In most cases, the contracting authority published information about the outcome of the contract.
In the case of one contracting authority, the contract information was not published due to a communication error.
It took the contracting authority six months to notice the error.
Consequently, the outcome of the procedure was not made public during that period.
SAO
Documentation
For events related to the organisation of a major sporting event, significant shortcomings were found in the documentation of the procurement procedure, such as incorrect quotation prices in the evaluation committee minutes.
In addition, some documents about opening envelopes were not signed.
Publication of contract award
In preparation for the repair and maintenance of roads, the construction of a motorway and a ring road, the contract notices were sent out after the deadline or were not published.
Summary
The provisions on documentation and notification and notification obligations cover European requirements and are almost identical in both countries.
This generally ensures the transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.
The Czech reporting obligations are somewhat stricter compared to the German ones.
The inspections revealed deficiencies substantially diminishing the value of documentation as a means of preventing corruption.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Contracting entities should continue to enhance the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with the notification and notification requirements.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
Parallel audits of the SAO and BRH focused on two areas that are essential for the public procurement process in both the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.
EU legislation provides an opportunity for international competition within the EU to create a single European market.
Measures to prevent corruption are not only aimed at avoiding or at reducing corruption, but also at preventing financial damage and possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the government.
The audit findings of the two audit institutions – SAO and BRH – with regard to the application of the procurement law of both countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions give an internal view of common and different elements that can help both countries in further development and application of this law.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries have transposed EU public procurement law into their national legislation.
There is thus an important common basis for both countries to award public contracts and meet basic competition requirements. equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.
Contracting entities reinforce these requirements in part by very far-reaching measures.
The Czech Republic has extended the provisions on public procurement requiring a European procedure to procedures that are below the EU thresholds and are therefore governed by national legislation.
However, the inspections showed that contracting entities are not always fully compliant with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.
German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate these irregularities, taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the audits identified risks affecting the economy and the achievement of value for money.
These include, in particular, the incomplete definition of the subject-matter of the contract, which resulted in additional works that were often unlawfully awarded, an insufficient definition of the estimated price, and the requisite qualifications, which narrowed the potential pool of tenderers and thus reduced competition in the field of transport construction in particular.
Preventing corruption
The joint inspections were not intended to detect cases of corruption.
The reason was that both BRH and SAO did not have sufficient tools for this.
However, they can check whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to reduce corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are being applied.
As regards the prevention of corruption, the two countries focused on different aspects.
In particular, the German provisions allow for broad and unrestricted competition, transparency and controls as a central element in the prevention of corruption.
In particular, the Czech regulations aim at enhancing the transparency of procurement procedures.
BRH
In Germany, there are general principles of corruption prevention that apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles have also been incorporated into public procurement requirements and have been adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.
The relevant provisions specify, sometimes with great precision, the means of complying with the requirements to prevent corruption during the procurement procedure and to select the persons involved.
In the opinion of BRH, the principle of preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate instrument to substantially reduce the risk of corruption in public procurement, while restricting competition increases the risk of manipulation.
Risk analysis and adequate controls (in particular the cross-checking principle), transparency requirements, tender documentation and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions have to comply with when awarding public contracts.
Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.
Irregularities found in some areas highlighted weaknesses in compliance with certain requirements.
Therefore, contracting entities should provide their staff with further training to familiarise them with anti-corruption requirements and further raise their awareness in this area.
A significant part of the weaknesses identified relate to activities delegated by the building administration to private entrepreneurs.
However, the lack of adequate controls on the delegation of powers increases the risk of abuse.
Activities susceptible to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorised interference.
SAO
In the Czech Republic, anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at government level, which also significantly affect the area of public procurement.
The SAO audits took place during the period when one of the most important parts of this strategy was implemented, namely the significant amendment of the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of subsequent implementing regulations.
The adopted strategy and new legislation can be effective steps to improve the situation.
Under the new rules, for example, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the contract, the determination of the estimated value of the contract, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the establishment of the basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of the tenders, and document and publish everything properly.
Recommendations
Overall, the SAO and the Czech National Bank (SAO) have a favourable opinion on ways of implementing EU requirements.
Their wide application in practice has confirmed that EU competition, equal treatment and transparency requirements form an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.
The transnational model in place in the EU can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.
Bearing in mind the great potential of material and non-material damage resulting from manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, both BRH and the SAO insist that it is the responsibility of contracting authorities to continue and improve measures against corruption and manipulation where possible.
In particular, organisational structures and procurement processes should be continuously monitored for weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond appropriately to the need for corrective action.
Compared to the practice in Germany, it has emerged that the share of open procurement procedures in the Czech Republic, which give room to competition and substantially reduce the possibility of corrupt behaviour, should increase.
The award of contracts in lots may also have a positive impact on the price achieved, where this is permissible and appropriate for the contracting authorities. A higher number of bidders puts pressure on the price achieved.
The organisation of the procurement procedure also has an influence on the conduct of the procurement procedure.
In Germany, it is organised by special state organisations, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport constructions, it is organised by the central authorities themselves or through contractual organisations.
The SAO and BRH wish to further develop their findings in their work, where appropriate, and to address them with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.
Moreover, they are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as these principles and findings are of general importance for the effective fight against corruption and for guaranteeing that public contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that value for money is achieved.

JOINT FINAL REPORT on the Results of Parallel Inspections of the Administration of Excise Taxes in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic
Joint final report
May 2017
Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic
Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic
Opening Word
The joint report presents the progress and result of international cooperation in parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on the administration of excise duties in 2012-2015.
Cooperation between supreme audit institutions of both countries was realized on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO of Slovakia and the SAO of the Czech Republic in the performance of parallel audits focused on the administration of excise duties, which was concluded in August 2015.
The topic of parallel controls was chosen based on the fact that both EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to find out how it is applied at national level, how the excise tax administration system is set up and how the systems in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic are different.
The greatest benefits of the control actions carried out were the exchange of experience, the identification of differences and the identification of good practice.
Last but not least, it was beneficial to find that the international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise duty administration is very limited without the implementation of parallel controls.

on the results of parallel controls of the administration of the SPD in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic
Summary and evaluation
The legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and their administration complies with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.
Differences have been found between the excise duty adjustment in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic; in the Czech Republic, it contributes to the effective administration of excise duties by verifying the economic stability of applicants for a permit and mandatory marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils and certain other oils; In Slovakia, the distribution of control stamps is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less burdensome for tax administrators.
In the fight against excise tax evasion, the supervision of the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw material, the implementation of the fuel distributor institute and the registration of sellers of consumer alcohol packaging have proved to be good practice in both countries.
Revenues from excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic are growing more slowly than other tax revenues.
The EU's goals of reducing taxes on labour, introducing eco-saving measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, not least because there is no indexation of excise duty rates in both countries.
This results in a reduction in the importance of excise duties on total tax revenues and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, a real reduction in the tax burden of excise duties.
The introduction of environmental measures has long been financially supported by the State, but these measures have a negative impact on excise revenue, which will have to be replaced in the future by other revenues or by a reduction in government expenditure.
Administrative expenditure spent on administration of excise duties in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia has been growing for a long time, mainly due to wage growth, and their efficiency has been declining.
In the SR, this efficiency is also negatively affected by expenditure on the computerisation of the administration of excise duties (IT expenditure) and by expenditure on the wages of employees performing permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.
The computerisation of the administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic has not significantly reduced the number of tax administrations.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend that the Slovak Ministry reconsider the validity of permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.
In the Czech Republic, the effectiveness of administrative expenditure was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the audited period that would lead to a reduction in the personnel requirements of the administration of excise duties.
The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the individual years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax entities in the Slovak Republic is about a third lower than in the Czech Republic.
Tax administrators in the Slovak Republic perform administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical exercise of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis.
Administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is administratively more demanding than in the Czech Republic and more costly due to the ratio of the number of tax transactions to the number of entities.
The computerisation of the administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.
In Slovakia, the administration of excise tax returns is fully electronized, in the Czech Republic, documents proving the taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are electronically transmitted.
Both ways of computerisation support efficient administration of excise duties, and therefore the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend applying them not only in both countries.
The total expenditure for the implementation of EMCS could not be compared as DG SR provided data on expenditure only for the upgrade of the system in the period 2011-2015, but expenditure was incurred before that period.
Expenditure incurred in the aforementioned period for the EMCS upgrade alone was approximately 20% higher in Slovakia than the expenditure incurred in the Czech Republic for both the introduction of EMCS and the upgrade of this system in more than ten years.
The excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia did not achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditures.
The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in the Slovak Republic the administration of excise duties is significantly more resource-intensive.
The introduction of the electronic system for monitoring the movement of excise products (EMCS) made the administration of excise duties more efficient, but to a lesser extent in the Slovak Republic, as significantly higher expenditure was spent on the introduction of the system and its modernisation than in the Czech Republic.
Basic information
The cooperation of the two audit institutions was carried out on the basis of the Cooperation Agreement during parallel inspections aimed at the administration of excise duties of 18.8.2015.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic agreed to perform parallel audits, which will primarily focus on the issue of excise tax administration and whose results will allow analysis, comparison and evaluation of the findings.
The common audit issues on which the parallel controls were based were agreed.
Characteristics of the subject-matter and objectives of the parallel check:
The aim of the parallel controls was to compare the performance of excise authorities, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify weaknesses in the excise administration process.
In particular, the following main audit questions were to be answered:
Did the excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditures?
Has the introduction of the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) made the administration of excise duties more efficient and has the cost of its introduction been expended effectively?
The parallel inspections carried out should have identified the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, especially in the area of legal regulation and in the setting of the organizational structure.

Legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
The excise administration legislation is divided into EU (see Annex 1) and national legislation (see Annex 2).
Council Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC defines excise duty and lays down the basic rules for the administration of taxes and the treatment of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
This Directive allows other products to be subject to excise duties.
In particular, EU legislation regulates the minimum conditions for: the level of tax rates for each type of selected product, the production, storage, processing and holding of taxable products, the chargeability of the tax, tax exemptions and refunds, the supervision of the transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and the keeping of registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.
EU legislation allows for the introduction of control procedures and institutes at national level, provided that they do not distort competition.
Legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic
Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the legislation on excise duties is concentrated in the Excise Tax Act (Act No. 353/2003 Coll.), which regulates the administration of mineral oil tax, alcohol tax, tobacco products tax, beer tax, wine and intermediate products tax and raw tobacco tax.
This law defines the forms of treatment of products subject to excise duties, the taxpayer, the authorisation procedure, the conditions for the transport of products, the declaration of tax and penalties for infringements of legislation.
The Act and subsequent Decrees further regulate certain other conditions for the handling of mineral oils (marking of mineral oils), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and storage of raw tobacco for purposes other than the manufacture of tobacco products.
Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in parts 45 to 47 of Act No. 261/2007 Coll., on Stabilization of Public Budgets.
In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the administration of excise duties are contained in special legislation. Act on Fuel No. 311/2006 Coll. and the implementing regulation regulate the conditions for the sale, supply, distribution of fuel and keeping of records of fuel put into free tax circulation.
Act No 61/1997 Coll., on ethyl alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for the production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of ethyl alcohol.
Act No.307/2013 Coll., on the mandatory labelling of alcohol, and the relevant implementing regulations stipulate the mandatory marking of alcohol in consumer packaging, the conditions for handling control tapes and the conditions for handling alcohol (i.e. for the production, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, transport, storage, takeover, use, possession, import or export of alcohol).
Tax procedures, which are not specified in special regulations, are regulated by Act No. 280/2009 Coll., the Tax Code.
Penalties are imposed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Act No 500/2004 Coll., Administrative Code.
The conditions for the issue of a trade licence (concession) for the operation of the trade "production and processing of fuels and lubricants and distribution of fuels" and "production, treatment and sale of fermentation alcohol, potable alcohol and spirits" are regulated by Act No.455/1991 Coll., on the trade licence business (Trade Licensing Act).
The Czech Republic has made use of the authorisation to introduce control procedures and institutes to control the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and to monitor compliance with the legislation in the treatment of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid, as well as in the treatment of selected products for which tax has already been paid.
These include the monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and raw tobacco, the labelling of certain other mineral oils, the labelling of tobacco products and alcohol in consumer packaging.
The Czech Republic used the right to apply excise duty to other products and introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.
Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Czech Republic
On the basis of the Government of the Czech Republic Resolution No. 735 of 3 October 2012, the implementation of the "zero tolerance plan for the black market in spirits" resulted in major legislative changes in the Czech Republic in 2012-2015, which introduced a number of measures against tax fraud on excise duty on alcohol.
In the same period, there were also major changes in the legislation on the mineral oil tax, the tax on tobacco products and the criminality of preparing tax evasion.
Criminal law protection of tax revenue
With effect from 1 July 2016, the preparation of the offence of "tax reduction, fee reduction and similar compulsory payment" is made a criminal offence. The modification should allow police authorities to take more effective and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, such as the deployment of operational means of investigation.
General provisions for the administration of excise duties
With effect from 1 January 2015, the issuance of a licence for the disposal of products subject to excise duty is subject to: reliability; indebtedness; economic stability; authorisation to operate a trade enabling the pursuit of activities related to the licence; a situation in which the applicant is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.
The aim of the legislation was, in particular, to address the problem of the build-up of tax arrears by reducing those entitled to dispose of products subject to excise duty.
The condition of economic stability newly allows the tax authorities to take into account the financial situation of tax entities both in the context of the authorisation procedure and after the authorisation.
The purpose of this measure is to prevent those who do not have sufficient financial resources to properly comply with their tax obligations from disposing of the selected products.
In order to assess the economic stability of the applicant, indicators (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity) have been established on the basis of which a financial analysis is carried out.
In addition to these indicators, the administrative discretion of the tax administrator depends on the individual conditions of the procedure.
The law stipulates the frequency of verification of compliance with the condition of economic stability due to the timeliness of the data – the verification takes place once a year, following the deadline for submission of the income tax return.
The tax administrator has the possibility to determine other conditions necessary for the administration of the tax.
If the permit holder does not fulfil the conditions, the tax administrator is entitled to revoke the permit or to revoke it with a delay.
Of the 2,609 entities for which the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic audited the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of arrears if the tax liability exceeds the amount of the tax collateral (e.g. repeated recipient).
Authorisations were revoked for ten entities, the other applicants increased their tax collateral, capitalised their contribution to the company or provided up-to-date accounting data showing that they already fulfilled all the conditions for authorisation.
In addition to the applicant, the conditions of reliability and indebtedness must also be fulfilled by a natural person who is a statutory body or a member thereof, or by a natural person who, although not a statutory body of the applicant or a member thereof, performs this activity (chaining of legal persons in the capacity of a statutory body or its member, so-called connected entities).
By the end of 2016, more than 30,000 connected entities had been screened.
The registers kept under the Act on Excise Duties (Sections 37 to 40 and Section 60 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.) contain data on:
the type, name, code and quantity of goods produced, received, issued or dispatched, broken down by type of tax treatment (suspension arrangement, importation, reintroduction into suspension arrangement, exportation, free tax circulation, captive use, loss);
the SEED ID of the recipient or supplier of the selected products, the declarant, the date of occurrence and registration;
transport of selected products (e.g. means of transport, carriers, number of transport);
the registration numbers of the related documents;
the notification of the release for free circulation of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging marked with a control tape and the details of its distribution.
A record of receipt after transport shall be made without delay after the transport has ended.
In the case of records kept electronically, records must be kept or allow output in the format xls, xlsx, ods.
Ethyl alcohol
After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures designed to provide a detailed overview of the activities of the operators (see Annex 3, Schema A) from the production of raw alcohol through the marking of the control tape to its distribution to the final seller or authorised user of the exempt alcohol.
In the Czech Republic, the production facility for the production of ethyl alcohol, which is not in operation, is also subject to supervision by customs authorities.
The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview of alcohol processing and the production of spirits and to identify persons handling spirits in consumer packaging, to reduce the handling of spirits to financially stable and reliable persons and to ensure constant supervision of the production and labelling of spirits.
The most important measures are: Records of production, receipt, stocks and issue of ethyl alcohol contain information on the quantity of ethyl alcohol by stage of production and processing of ethyl alcohol, with document numbers.
Limitations on the volume of consumer packaging, packaging material and restrictions on the number of packages with broken surveillance tape at the point of final sale or delivery to the consumer.
Consumer packaging means a container or other container with a capacity of not more than one litre, or three litres if it is a container made of glass.
Spirits put up in larger packages are considered as unmarked and prohibited to be handled.
At the point of final sale to a natural person for his or her personal use, there may be a maximum of one consumer pack with a broken control tape, or three if fitted with a one-way valve.
Compulsory registration of a person who places alcohol in products in consumer packaging having at least 15 % by volume of alcohol into free tax circulation and is: an importer of alcohol, a producer of alcohol in the Czech Republic or an operator of a tax warehouse under suspension of tax exemption, provided that personal and technical conditions are fulfilled.
The personal conditions – reliability, integrity and non-pronouncement of disqualification – must be fulfilled by the applicant and a person in the capacity of a statutory body or a responsible representative.
The applicant must provide a security deposit of CZK 100,000 to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approximately €3,700 to €185,000) depending on the amount of control tapes taken.
The technical conditions for registration are a suitable place for alcohol marking and the equipment of the place of marking or tax warehouse with a camera monitoring device with continuous operation and remote access of the tax administrator.
Registration labels for control tapes are introduced for the labelling of spirit drinks with a volume of more than 0,06 litre.
When control tapes are being transported, the identification of the control tapes shall be indicated on the transport documents or the customs declaration at export.
The control tape until 30.11.2013 contained a 10-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration sampling number, the code of the application for the allocation of control tapes and the code of classification according to the level of the ethanol concentration by volume.
The control tape from 1 December 2013 newly contains two types of identifiers and the amount of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20 °C, rounded down to the nearest millilitres.
The record of the control tapes for the labelling of spirit drinks contains daily records of the different ways of handling the control tapes according to the registration codes, as well as the documents on the basis of which the registration took place.
In the event of the destruction, loss or theft of specific control tapes, the holder of the control tapes shall electronically notify the tax authorities of the registration code of the control tapes in question and their number on the following working day after the operative event.
Introducing a new factual basis for offences and adjusting the level of penalties imposed for infringements of legislation when dealing with control tapes.
Penalties may be imposed up to the amount of the excise duty or may exceed it by a factor of 10 (e.g. destruction or loss of control tapes in excess of 0.1% of the total quantity of an individual order for control tapes, failure to return the control tape within the statutory time limit).
Restriction of the handling of control tapes only to registered holders, who may not transfer them to another person, with the exception of their provision to a foreign supplier for the purpose of marking spirits in consumer packaging produced outside the Czech Republic.
The control tapes exported must be placed on the consumer packaging and brought back no later than nine months after receipt from the tax authorities.
Compulsory registration of a distributor of alcohol in consumer packaging, provided that similar personal conditions are met as for a person obliged to mark alcohol and with the obligation to deposit a deposit of up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approx. €185,000).
Definition of persons for the sale or purchase of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging.
Eligible persons shall be obliged to sell alcohol in consumer packaging to other registered persons or to final sellers or may sell it as a final seller.
They may acquire alcohol from other registered persons, the insolvency practitioner, the administrative authority, organisational units of the State or unregistered persons in the course of tax execution.
Notices of the release for free circulation of ethyl alcohol or sales in consumer packaging are to be sent by the holders and distributors of ethyl alcohol to the tax administrator immediately on the day following the operative event via the information system maintained by the tax administrator (ORO web client) or in accordance with the content in xml format.
The notification shall include the number of control strips used, the volume and type of consumer packaging, the percentage by volume of ethyl alcohol, the European Commodity Code (EAN), the identification of the distributor or final seller, as well as the name of the product and the batch of production.
Tax entities sent about 10.5 million notifications in 2014 and 2015.
Compulsory concession (a specific form of trade licence) not only for the production and treatment of ethyl alcohol, but also for the sale of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging by an entrepreneur to a natural person for his personal use or to another legal or business natural person for his own internal use.
Licensed trades can be carried out only after a decision by the Trade Licensing Office, subject to compliance with professional competence and other conditions.
No prescribed professional competence is required for the sale of ethyl alcohol.
The benefit for the tax administrator is an overview of sellers and their establishments and restrictions.
trading to reliable entities.
In the Czech Republic, about 94,000 licenses were registered in 2014 and about 104,000 in 2015 for the industry including production, treatment of ethyl alcohol, potable alcohol, spirits and other alcoholic beverages and sales.
Checks on compliance with legislation in the area of handling products subject to excise duties in the Czech Republic are also ensured in their activities outside the tax administrator: trade licensing offices, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection Authority, authorities of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic, authorities of the Czech Trade Inspection Authority.
If it finds that there has been a breach of duty or a breach of prohibition, it shall immediately inform the excise authorities thereof.
Mineral oils
The Czech Republic has put in place a comprehensive surveillance system (see Annex 3, Diagram B) to which mineral oils subject to excise duty, but also selected mineral oils not subject to excise duty, which have been used for tax evasion.
The system includes monitoring from the production of mineral oil through the storage, transport, marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils, the marking of certain other mineral oils up to delivery to the final consumer or user and, in some cases, the consumption of mineral oils.
The supervision of the customs authorities includes the production of marking agents for the marking and handling of mineral oils.
The mineral oils listed under CN codes 2710 19 25 (kerosene other), 2710 19 29 (other medium oils not elsewhere specified) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49 shall be subject to the marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils unless their marking is prohibited.
For example, benzol, toluene, xylol and lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than motor propulsion are subject to the labelling of certain other mineral oils.
It is only possible to mark and dye selected mineral oils and some other mineral oils with a marker substance on the basis of the permission of the tax administrator.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The most significant new measures since 2012:
Monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils which are a group of mineral oils falling within Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than motor propulsion) whose kinematic viscosity at 40 °C is less than 12 mm2. s-1 inclusive and has at least one of the following characteristics: flash point less than 150 °C, distillation test distils at least 20 % of the volume including losses up to 350 °C.
These mineral oils were misused as an additive in the finished fuel, in particular diesel, or were directly used or sold for engine propulsion because the physical characteristics are very similar.
Registration with the tax authority is required for entities handling monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packages exceeding 220 litres.
The personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative must be fulfilled for the issuance of the registration, which shall apply throughout 2 With the exception of beer, fruit wines, other wines and mead and fruit spirits obtained by firing.
No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.
4 For example, when mineral oil is used as fuel (excluding navigation on water, unless it is a private pleasure craft) or as an ingredient for the production of fuel, when the marking is defective in its use.
registration.
As of 30 November 2016, the Register of Persons Handling Special Mineral Oils contained 54 valid registrations, upon the proposal of the holder of the registration, four registrations were cancelled.
The electronic register shall contain detailed information on the receipt, own consumption and the sale or transfer of the mineral oil, including document numbers, numbers of notifications of acquisition to the tax authorities, places of storage and consumption, the purpose of consumption, the place of storage and consumption or, on sale, the place of delivery and the customer's registration number.
Notification of any acquisition of a special mineral oil must be given to the tax authority between 24 and 72 hours before receipt.
The identification of the trading partners, the name and nomenclature of the specific mineral oil, the quantity, the purpose of consumption or information on the sale or transfer shall be reported.
Notification of the estimated quantity of mineral oil acquired, sold or consumed in the relevant year shall be submitted by the entity together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
Notifications of the purpose of use and marking, place of storage or consumption, identification details of the person to whom the special mineral oil is resold or transferred shall be given before any change.
Notifications shall be submitted electronically by means of smart forms or by a data container in PDFa format.
In 2015, 630 notifications were submitted by persons handling special mineral oils.
The seizure and forfeiture of special mineral oils or means of transport must be declared by the tax administrator in cases where he finds handling of special mineral oils without registration or where the registered person fails to fulfil his reporting obligation.
As in the case of non-compliances in the transport of excise products, these deficiencies cannot be corrected subsequently.
Registration of a fuel distributor is compulsory for persons who sell or are authorised to sell fuel.
Registered fuel distributors may only be persons meeting the following criteria:
Compulsory concession of the Trade Licensing Office (a specific form of trade licence).
The application for a concession or, where appropriate, the appointment of a responsible representative, shall be subject to an opinion by the customs office, which shall examine whether the applicant for the concession, the statutory body or the members of the statutory body of the applicant legal person and the designated responsible representative meet the condition of reliability.
If these persons meet the condition of reliability, the customs office issues a favourable opinion.
Reliable person means a person of good character in terms of criminal law, property, customs law and tax law.
Professional competence is a condition for the award of the concession.
Indebtedness of the same class of persons as in the case of reliability.
A debtor is a person who provides sufficient guarantees that he or she will meet his or her payment obligations to the State in a proper and timely manner, i.e. he or she does not have arrears to the State budget and to the general health insurance.
A fuel distributor shall not be prohibited from operating by a court or administrative authority.
The fuel distributor shall not be in liquidation or bankruptcy.
Deposit deposit (or bank guarantee) of 20 000 000 CZK (i.e. approx. 740 000 €), which can be reduced to 10 000 000 CZK (i.e. approx. 370 000 €) after three years of registration of the fuel distributor and fulfilment of other conditions.
The distributor shall be obliged to submit a fuel distribution notification to the customs office within 20 days of the end of the calendar month.
The electronic notification shall contain details of the individual purchase and sale of fuel.
The data to be reported are data on trading partners, document numbers, product selected, quantity, price, carrier and transport, place of loading and unloading.
The right to a refund of the tax on mineral oils consumed in primary agricultural production was reintroduced at the end of 2014.
Refund of excise duty on mineral oils may be claimed only in respect of an activity which is clearly connected with the activity carried out on the land.
In 2015, there were about 64,000 claims for a tax refund totalling CZK 1,172,844,680 (i.e., EUR 43,401,720).
Since 2017, the Czech government has also introduced a refund of excise duty on fuel to livestock farmers.
Farmers or breeders who, for example, are engaged in the breeding of cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats will be newly able to exercise this right.
Tobacco products
Restrictions on sales of tobacco products with the old tax rate
In response to the long-term under-achievement of budgeted revenues from excise duties on tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced a restriction on sales of tobacco products with the old tax rate in case of a change in the tax rate with effect from 1 December 2014.
Excise duty on tobacco products shall be paid by the use of tobacco labels.
The use of a tobacco sticker means placing it on a unit packet (Section 116 of the Excise Duty Act).
For the application of the rate of excise duty, the production of the tobacco product in the condition intended for the final consumer shall be taken into account, without its removal from storage, delivery, dispatch or sale or sale to the final consumer.
The letter of the alphabet characterising the rate of excise duty appears on the tobacco sticker together with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, and the sticker indicates the number of items in the package or the quantity of smoking tobacco in kilograms.
The tobacco sticker has no identifier.
The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packets of cigarettes intended for direct consumption and bearing a tobacco label bearing the previous (old) rate of duty was fixed until the end of the last day of the second calendar month following the entry into force of the new rate of excise duty.
The development of the removal of tobacco labels in 2014 and the comparison with the development in previous years shows that tobacco manufacturers significantly frontloaded tobacco products with the ‘old’ tax rate each year, effectively shifting the effectiveness of the ‘new’ tax rate by about one year.
Raw tobacco tax
Due to the misuse of raw tobacco for the manufacture of tobacco products without the permission of the tax authorities and the non-payment of excise duty, a tax on raw tobacco and monitoring of the handling of raw tobacco were introduced as measures against tax fraud.
With effect from 1 July 2015, raw tobacco which has not been used or supplied for the manufacture of tobacco products, has not been supplied to another Member State or to a third country, or for which the origin, the intended use or the person to whom the raw tobacco has been or is to be supplied has not been proved shall be subject to excise duty.
Restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco
Measures such as the supervision of the transport and manufacture of tobacco products, the marking of unit packets with a control tape and restrictions on sales in designated places have been complemented by restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.
Manufacturing facilities for the processing of tobacco raw materials and the manufacture of tobacco products shall not be subject to customs supervision.
Only a registered person may store raw tobacco for purposes other than the manufacture of tobacco products, but such tobacco may not be further processed or treated.
A registered person may only be a person meeting the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative, which applies throughout the registration period.
The conditions for registration are: (a) authorisation to operate a trade allowing the activity of a person storing raw tobacco, (b) reliability, (c) indebtedness, (d) the fact that the person storing the raw tobacco has not been banned from carrying out his activity, (e) the fact that the person storing the raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, (f) the provision of a security of CZK 20 000 000 (i.e. approximately EUR 740 000).
The electronic register shall contain the date of receipt or delivery of the raw tobacco, the document number, the identification of the business partner, the quantity and type of the raw tobacco.
Notification of any acquisition of raw tobacco by a registered person storing raw tobacco must be given to the tax authorities at intervals of 24 to 72 hours before receipt or dispatch.
The details of the trading partner, the quantity of raw tobacco, the storage address, the purpose of use and the details of the carrier shall be reported.
Notification of the expected quantities of raw tobacco received or dispatched in the relevant year shall be submitted by the entity together with the registration application or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
The notifications shall be submitted electronically by means of a data container in PDFa format.
Transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document with the requisite particulars.
Legislation on excise duties in Slovakia
The legal framework regulating the area of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is based on EU legislation and thus co-creates its single tax system.
Individual types of excise duties are exhaustively determined by SR legislation, which is similar to that of neighbouring countries.
Definition of legislation in the Slovak Republic
Legislative regulation of excise duties is ensured by four laws according to the individual subject of the tax.
Harmonisation has been achieved by the adoption of the following laws on excise duties: Act No 98/2004 Coll., on excise duty on mineral oils, Act No 106/2004 Coll., on excise duty on tobacco products, Act No 530/2011 Coll., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No 609/2007 Coll., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
All excise tax laws are substantive law rules and deal with the taxation of the subject of excise duties in the tax territory.
Act No. 563/2009 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes (Tax Code), is a regulation of procedural law, regulates the administration of taxes, rights and obligations of tax subjects and other persons.
This legal framework transposed individual provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC and transposed provisions of other European Community directives and legislation.
Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Slovak Republic
Since 2011, legislation on the administration of excise duties has undergone several major changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.
In the EMCS system, the traffic monitoring of selected excise products under suspension of excise duty has been changed from a paper accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system where such traffic is monitored in real time.
Under the EMCS electronic system, the institute of suspending the access of tax subjects to the EMCS was introduced in 2015.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The customs office has the possibility to suspend access precisely when there is a well-founded fear of an invalid or undetermined tax from previous tax years and its unenforceability.
This relates to the chargeability of the tax, since the transport of excise goods requires the lodging of a security, which is released when the transport is completed.
Excise duty on mineral oils
A major change in the administration of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the possibility to use so-called red diesel was abolished.
The gas oil, commonly called red diesel, was a mineral oil.
In the past, red diesel was used for specific legally defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.
This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.
The aim of the abolition of red diesel was to reduce the public deficit, simplify the taxation system for mineral oils and reduce the administrative burden on the businesses concerned.
In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel vendor.
The purpose of this legal amendment was to introduce an obligation to keep a register for all service stations.
The clarification of the movement of taxed petrol and diesel is linked to the obligation to purchase petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.
In 2014, new institutes of tax entities were introduced, namely the fuel distributor and the fuel consumer.
This amendment has contributed to the elimination of tax evasion for petrol and diesel and has clarified the movement of these fuels (see Annex 4, Figure A).
As part of the fight against tax evasion, the legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils have been extended.
In SR, however, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation to be labelled with an indicator substance.
Excise duty on tobacco products
As part of the fight against tax evasion and the monitoring of tobacco raw materials, the scope of the Tobacco Raw Material Act has been extended and a new tax entity – a trader in tobacco raw materials – has been introduced.
Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.
Furthermore, the obligation to register technological installations for the manufacture of tobacco products was introduced.
The legislation introduced a new system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control marks for the labelling of consumer packages of tobacco products.
Cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco are marked with the control mark.
Under the new system, the purchaser of control stamps must apply to the customs office for the issue of control stamps electronically, using the information system for the collection of control stamps.
This step introduced electronic communication between the taxpayer and the tax authorities.
One state-owned stamp control printer was established – in the Kremnice Mint.
The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of control stamps has also been introduced.
The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.
The new system for printing control marks strengthens the system for checking goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the control mark to easily verify whether the goods originate from legal sources.
The unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd digit) shall form the checksum; 3. the location determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4. place is the series identifier; 5.-8. place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9-12. The place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.
Furthermore, the price of the cigarettes, the symbol for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in a consumer package and the length of the cigarettes must be indicated on the control mark used to mark the cigarettes.
Excise duty on alcoholic beverages
The biggest legislative change affected ethyl alcohol, wine and beer, as the original three rules of substantive law were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.
The law was drafted mainly because of the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of taxation of alcoholic beverages, solution of their production, monitoring of movement, securing the tax, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, streamline the administration of the tax, reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.
The new approach to the taxation of different types of alcoholic beverages introduced the application of a uniform rate of excise duty to alcoholic beverages and took into account the volume percentage of the actual alcoholic strength.
For still wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the final product shall be taken into account.
The beer concentration shall also be expressed as a percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the finished product.
A category of small-scale producer of fermented beverages has been introduced, the essence of which is to exempt from excise duty a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented beverage for his own consumption and that of his household up to a maximum of 1 000 litres per marketing year.
The legislation introduced a new system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control marks for the labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.
Under the new system, the purchaser of control stamps must apply to the customs office for the issue of control stamps electronically, using the information system for the collection of control stamps.
This step introduced electronic communication between the taxpayer and the tax authorities.
One state-owned stamp control printer was established – in the Kremnice Mint.
The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of control stamps has also been introduced.
The changes have significantly contributed to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Figure B) and the elimination of the falsification of control stamps.
The new system for printing control marks strengthens the system for checking goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the control mark to easily verify whether the goods originate from legal sources.
The unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd digit) shall form the checksum; 3. the location determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4. place is the series identifier; 5.-8. place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9-12. The place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
Excise duties on ethyl alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by a common law no. 353/2003 Coll.
The tax on solid fuels, the tax on natural gas and certain other gases and the tax on electricity are part of Act No. 261/2007 Coll.
In Slovakia, on the other hand, every excise duty is regulated by a special law, with the exception of the law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, which contains a tax on alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.
A special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
In the Czech Republic, as of 1 January 2015, the issue of an authorisation to dispose of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act is subject, among other things, to proof of the economic stability of the applicants, which is verified annually by the customs authorities by carrying out a financial analysis.
In the Slovak Republic, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding to waive or reduce the reinsurance tax.
FR SR performs tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate over the handling of control marks for the marking of alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printer and their sale to individual customers.
The law stipulates that the production of control stamps is carried out by the state-owned Mincovna Kremnica.
The production of tobacco stickers and control strips in the Czech Republic is not supervised by customs authorities.
Tobacco stickers and control strips will be taken from the printer by the authorized territorial office of the customs office in Kutna Hora.
Tobacco stickers are taken over by their purchasers in this territorial workplace, and alcohol labelling control tapes are further distributed to individual locally competent tax authorities according to the place of marking.
The legislation of the Czech Republic does not define manufacturers of tobacco stickers and control strips.
In the Slovak Republic there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products or a part thereof, in the Czech Republic there is no such obligation.
In the Czech Republic, the tobacco sticker bears the excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when the tobacco stickers are taken from the designated customs office.
In the Slovak Republic, on the other hand, the stamp does not contain excise duty on tobacco products.
In the Czech Republic, the refund of excise duty on mineral oils in case of their use for agricultural plant primary production, so-called green diesel, was introduced during the audited period.
As of 2017, this tax refund was extended to livestock production.
In SR such support for farmers is not introduced (it existed until 31.12.2010 as so-called red diesel).
In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a deposit of CZK 20 million (i.e. EUR 740 thousand) was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic.
As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1 891 entities in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1 717 tax entities).
In Slovakia, a similar fuel distributor institute is in place, but without the deposit required to ensure excise duty on mineral oils.
In Slovakia, 303 distributors were registered in 2014 and 407 distributors were registered in 2015.
In Slovakia, there is an institute of fuel seller and fuel consumer, which is issued by the locally competent customs office.
There is no such institute in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic selected mineral oils and also some other mineral oils are subject to labelling, in the Slovak Republic the labelling of mineral oils is not applied after the abolition of the so-called red diesel.
In the Czech Republic, the alcohol control tape contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of the alcohol and a twelve-digit registration code indicating the spirit content of the spirit drink, according to which the control tape is kept.
The destruction, loss and return of the control tape shall be entered in the register on the following working day.
The holder of the tape shall be obliged to notify their use within the same time limit.
In SR, the stamp intended for the marking of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging contains a unique 12-digit identification number, which, if used once a month, is communicated to the tax authorities and is used to verify the authenticity of the stamp.
The record contains the number of control stamps collected, used and reclaimed.
Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have introduced the institute of compulsory registration or registration of the alcohol distributor.
In the Slovak Republic, registration is subject to the fulfilment of conditions relating, inter alia, to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; an annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol of at least EUR 100 000; or a paid-up capital of at least EUR 100 000; a minimum of 10 employees.
In the Czech Republic, the registration is conditional, among other things, on the deposit of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. EUR 185,000) in favour of the tax administrator for the whole period of validity of the registration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Slovak Republic, the permanent presence of the tax authorities is required for the production of alcohol not only in consumer packaging.
In the Czech Republic, the production of alcohol in consumer packaging requires a special form of registration of the person obliged to mark alcohol with the condition of lodging a deposit in favour of the tax administrator ranging from CZK 100,000 (i.e. EUR 3,700) up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. EUR 185,000) depending on the amount of control tapes taken and the installation of a monitoring device with continuous access of the tax administrator.
Evaluation
The legislation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia goes well beyond the EU minimum requirements for the subject matter and administration of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States as well as to risks identified in tax territories.
Legislative changes adopted during the audited period allow tax authorities to prevent possible tax evasion to a greater extent.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as part of the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw material (e.g. leaves), an excise duty on raw tobacco or tobacco raw material was introduced in addition to the EU legislation.
Although raw tobacco and tobacco raw material are not harmonised tobacco products, the Czech Republic and Slovakia monitor their movements.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic may recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.
In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that the verification of economic stability of applicants for authorisation under the Excise Tax Act has proved successful because it reduces the risk of tax arrears.
For this reason, both audit institutions recommend applying such verifications also in SR conditions.
The distribution of control stamps is more efficient in the Slovak Republic than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden customs authorities with the costs related to transport between the printer and the purchaser of control tapes and tobacco stickers.
The financial administration of the Slovak Republic has a better overview of the existence and location of technological facilities for the production of tobacco products.
In the Czech Republic, however, the collection of tax on tobacco products is more effective, because the order of a tobacco sticker is a tax return with the subsequent payment of tax.
The financial administration in Slovakia has a better overview of the places of sale of fuel thanks to the introduction of the concepts of "fuel seller" and "fuel consumer".
The introduction of mandatory marking of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the misuse of mineral oils with a reduced tax rate or exempted from tax.
In the Czech Republic (2013) and Slovakia (2014) a new control tape, or a stamp containing an identification code, was introduced.
The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains the registration code, while in the Slovak Republic the new legislation has abandoned its use.
Impacts cannot yet be evaluated due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.
The introduction of effective labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol with a control mark or tape is an effective measure to combat tax evasion.
The SAO of Slovakia and the SAO of the Czech Republic may also recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States.
SR's position on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterised by a pro-client approach that does not block the funds of tax entities.
On the other hand, the approach of the Czech Republic is rather restrictive, as it introduces a deposit burdening the cash flow of tax subjects, but it reduces the risk of tax arrears.
Development of excise revenue
Excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the State in order to increase the revenue of the State budget and also to regulate the quantity of goods sold, the consumption of which is considered to be harmful to individuals and/or society (the regulatory function of the tax).
According to the Commission Communication ‘EUROPE 2020 — A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth’ of 3.3.2010 under the Flagship Initiative ‘Resource efficient Europe’, the European Commission intends to improve the framework for the use of market-based instruments, including by revising energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.
In order to fulfil the EC's objective, Member States should seek to shift the tax burden from labour to, inter alia, energy and environmental taxation as part of a more "greening" of tax systems.
The collection of excise tax revenue in the Czech Republic and Slovakia includes the collection of excise duty on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.
The share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share in GDP is monitored, inter alia, by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Both supreme audit institutions used the following selection criteria to enter the query on the OECD website.
Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share in GDP declined slightly according to OECD data.
The exchange rate of the European Central Bank (ECB) was used to convert the amounts in CZK into € on 31 December of the relevant year.
The nominal exchange rate of the CZK against the euro in 2013 depreciated by 9.1% year-on-year compared to 2012 (from 25.140 to 27.425).
This was mainly due to the CNB Bank Board's monetary policy decision of 7 November 20136.
The resulting values of collection of excise duties, rates of excise duties and per capita income in € decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.
The significant reduction in the share of excise duties in 2014 was due to a one-off shortfall in excise duty revenue from tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of tobacco products with the old rate of duty.
The share of excise duties is also influenced by the growth in the collection of income taxes, which has increased significantly as a result of the improved overall economic situation in the Czech Republic.
Excise duty on mineral oils accounts for the largest share of the total collection of excise duties (about 55.7% in 2015), but this fell in spite of the significant growth of the economy compared to 2012.
The collection of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although the registration of fuel distributors was introduced in 2013 as an anti-tax measure.
The trend of eco-efficient vehicles and the promotion of biofuels are negatively reflected in the tax revenue.
Gas tax, solid fuel tax and electricity tax account for a negligible share, which is due to a low tax rate compared to neighbouring countries, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU.
If rates are not increased, their share will decrease in the future in view of the ever decreasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.
The collection of excise duty on ethyl alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the repercussions of a large-scale tax fraud case involving the putting into circulation of untaxed ethyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol containing methanol or under-denatured ethyl alcohol in the form of spirits.
In 2015, following the adoption of a number of measures against such behaviour and the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the 2012 collection by EUR 4 million.
The proportion of the tax on tobacco products has increased as a result of rising rates.
The standard rates of excise duties changed between 2012 and 2015 for the tax on tobacco products, with an increase in the rate mainly due to compliance with Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.
As a result of the CNB's monetary intervention, the real rate of excise duties in €, excluding the tax on tobacco products, fell significantly. It has risen only slightly for tobacco products.
In relation to price growth, GDP or the standard of living, there is no indexation of the rate of excise duties, so the function of excise duties to regulate socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.
With economic growth in the Czech Republic and rising living standards, real rates of excise duties are decreasing.
7 Indexation – automatic adjustment of a certain economic quantity for inflation, this adjustment is made on the basis of a law or a contract (in the case of pensions paid by the state it is called indexation).
Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Slovak Republic
In the current legislation on excise duties in the Slovak Republic, the indexation of the level of excise duty rates and the evolution of consumer prices are not addressed because they are fixed.

Of all excise duties introduced in Slovakia, excise duty on mineral oils accounts for the largest share of the state budget's annual tax revenues, while its share did not fall below 52% in the whole audited period.
Excise duty on tobacco products accounts for the second largest share.
This tax accounts on average for around 32% of total excise duty collection.
Between 2012 and 2015, there was an increase in the collection of excise duty per capita in Slovakia.
This development is due to an increase in the rates of excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
The increase in the collection of excise duties per inhabitant of the Slovak Republic is constant and corresponds to the evolution of excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
In the Czech Republic, the decrease in income in € per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention in the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro.
The difference between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which in the Czech Republic is about 2.7 and 2.8 times higher, respectively, but per capita the collection of these selected products is only about 1/3 higher.
This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the exchange rate of CZK against € for foreign consumers.
The tax on mineral oils is also caused by greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.
In the case of the tax on tobacco products, growing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a significant impact.
Evaluation Real rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic were falling as a result of the CNB's interventions.
The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in total tax revenues is not increasing and there is no shift from taxation of labour to taxation of consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.
However, the achieved value of the share of excise duties is consistently above the OECD average.
The overall collection of excise duties is influenced mainly by the change in excise duty rates, the development of the economic condition and the behaviour of the population.
Future shortfalls in the collection of excise duties due to environmental measures, which are subsidised by the State in various forms, will have to be compensated by other revenues or by a reduction in the State's expenditure.
The lack of indexation of excise duty rates in the Czech Republic and Slovakia reduces their regulatory function and insufficiently supports the EU's objectives of a Europe less dependent on environmentally friendly sources and reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco.
The higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic is reflected in higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of selected products in €.
Administrative expenditure of excise duties
The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and revenue related to the administration of excise duties, i.e. it expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).
The higher the value, the worse the efficiency of administrative costs.
The effectiveness of the tax administrator in administering the tax affects the scope and organizational organization of the tax administrator, the management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of electronization of individual activities.
The calculation of the administrative cost-effectiveness of the tax administration by the conversion rate method is based on the number of employees involved in the administration of excise duties in a line-managed structure.
In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is performed, among other activities, by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organisational unit of the state and an accounting unit.
In the Slovak Republic, the administration of the tax is ensured by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, while the customs authorities are the internal organisational unit, costs and revenues are included for the whole organisational unit.
Therefore, with regard to the possibility to compare the efficiency of the administration of excise duties, expenditures and revenues of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were included in the calculation of the efficiency of administrative costs.
Administrative costs of the administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic
The administration of excise duties is a complex of administrative tasks performed mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
Some partial control tasks are carried out by other public authorities, but their importance is negligible.
The excise duties are administered mainly by the following departments:
Directorate-General for Customs
Department 23 TAXATION
Department 231 – Tax Methodologies monitors and proposes legislative measures, ensures the interpretation of legislation, methodically manages and coordinates: the execution of tax administration agendas and related regulations, in particular tax proceedings and related control and supervision activities, the administration of transport of selected products;

Division 39 – Tobacco stickers and control tapes – is an organisational unit of the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region and performs activities in the field of ordering, production and distribution and disposal of tobacco stickers and control tapes.
For the disposal of returned/damaged tobacco stickers, representatives of both the Customs Office and the DG are present to supervise the disposal process and to draw up a record of the disposal.
In the case of alcohol-labelled control tapes, the Director of the Customs Office shall appoint, by an internal management act, a three-member committee for the disposal of discarded, unsealed/returned control tapes by shredding.
After the physical shredding of the control tapes has taken place, the chairman of the Winding-up Committee shall ensure that the details of the destroyed control tapes are recorded;

Administrative costs of excise administration in Slovakia
Since 1 January 2012, the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic has undergone a demanding transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme.
The creation of DG SR was also reflected in the staff composition of the newly created departments of the merged customs and tax administration.
In the context of the excise administration, the excise administration activities within the organisational structure of DG SR have been integrated into a larger number of different sections and related departments.
Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic Customs and Tax Section DG SR Excise Tax Department (Slovak-wide competence):
Excise Department – directs and coordinates excise administration activities; draws up expert opinions; makes proposals and comments on legislative changes; issues decisions on the delegation of territorial jurisdiction to tax subjects; assigns and cancels registration numbers;
the separation of the exercise of fiscal supervision – directs and coordinates activities in the field of the exercise of fiscal supervision and fiscal control; exercises fiscal supervision;
Department of ELO and SPD systems – directs and coordinates mutual administrative cooperation activities in the field of excise duties, including the exchange of information through SEED and ISA systems; provides management and updates in the SysNeD and EMCS application equipment;
Control stamp department – directs printing and control stamp handling activities; performs tax supervision over the loading and disposal of printing sheets and control stamps in the printing works.
Department of the Vice-President of Financial Administration
Department of Excise and Customs Appeals (Slovak-wide scope):
Excise appeals department - review customs decisions on the basis of ordinary and emergency appeals; Appeals procedure at the second stage of the decision-making process.
The Customs Offices Section was created in the course of 2012, directly incorporating individual Customs Offices (9 Customs Offices) which have a territorial competence determined by higher territorial units, with the exception of one Customs Office which was established inter alia to perform tasks in relation to the external border of the Community.
Customs offices:
Excise Division – carrying out methodological work in relation to customs offices' branches and customs offices' stations; for selected entities, the tax administrator performs direct acts and decides on registration (tax warehouse, authorized receiver, repeated receiver, registered sender), on the amount of tax security, determines and refunds the tax, performs tax supervision and tax control; decides to waive the lodging of the tax security; decide to waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee in a tax warehouse for ethyl alcohol;
Legal Division – decision-making in cases of tax infringements; activities related to ordinary and extraordinary remedies; tax execution proceedings;
branch of the customs office – decides on the registration (except for the tax warehouse, the authorised receiver for re-admission, the registered consignor), the amount of the tax security; prescribes and refunds the tax; performs tax supervision and tax control; decides on security and on the forfeiture of goods;
Customs office stations – the exercise of fiscal supervision over the possession and movement of excise goods; ensures the exercise of permanent tax supervision in the alcohol tax warehouse; decides on security and on the forfeiture of goods.
Expenditure of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic on administration of excise duties is constantly increasing, as, with the exception of wage growth, investment in effective administration of taxes and computerisation of financial administration is increasing.
Although revenue from excise duties increased, expenditure grew faster as a result of IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project.
Wage expenditure in the Slovak Republic is significantly affected by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol, which the Czech Republic does not apply.
Expenditure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on administration of excise duties increased more significantly between 2012 and 2015 in 2015, this growth was mainly due to growth in wage expenditure and expenditure on technical support.
In the Czech Republic, revenues from excise duties also grew at roughly the same pace.
Wage expenditures in the Czech Republic are positively influenced by broader competencies of the customs administration, e.g. weighing of trucks, monitoring of compliance with obligations related to tolls.
The efficiency of administrative costs in the Slovak Republic shows a slightly deteriorating trend year-on-year.
The number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditure per employee increased.
Also in the Czech Republic, the number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditure per employee grew more slowly than in the Slovak Republic.
Evaluation
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, wage growth is an important factor in the impaired efficiency of administrative expenditure, which can be assessed as a natural development.
In both countries, maintaining a high administrative burden in the administration of excise duties appears to be a negative factor, as is confirmed by the continuing presence of staff in the administration of excise duties.
In the Slovak Republic, however, the administration of excise duties with lower revenues is significantly more demanding in terms of staffing capacity.
Performance indicators for the administration of excise duties
The administration of excise duties is a set of activities aimed at correctly identifying, determining and securing the payment of the tax.
The main processes in the administration of excise duties are tax assessment, authorisation and registration, supervision of transport, control and search of tax subjects.
The numbers of administrative tasks and entities managed are indicators of the performance of the tax administrator.
The correlation between the monitored indicator and the number of tax administrators expresses the effectiveness of the tax administrator's activities and defines the cost of a specific activity.
Authorisation and registration are essential for the handling and transport of selected products for commercial purposes under a duty suspension arrangement.
The tax administrator is obliged to perform continuous administration with the entities with a permit or registration, focusing on supervision of compliance with legal regulations and conditions set by the tax administrator, for which adequate personnel resources must be allocated.
The indicator monitored was the number of valid permits or registrations for the activity at 31 December of each year.
The number of permits or registrations issued is not the same as the number of tax entities.
Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in a matter.
The monitored administrative acts are often the most important acts of the tax administrator (tax claims, transport administration in EMCS), or activities that are a sequence of acts ending with a report or decision.
Performance indicators in the Czech Republic
Authorisation and registration for activities in the Czech Republic
Tax warehouse:
The production, processing, storage, receipt or dispatch of selected products is possible on the basis of the tax administrator's permission to operate a tax warehouse.
Where a tax warehouse operator has more than one warehouse, the authorisation shall be issued for each one separately, including the securing of the tax.
Tax security is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administrator (i.e. the physical presence of the official and the securing of the establishment by the tax administrator's conclusions).
In the Czech Republic, permanent tax supervision is not applied.
The tax warehouse operator also registers for tax under § 125 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.
Authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products exempt from tax from the place of importation to a tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in another Member State, to the place of exportation in another Member State or to a consignee in another Member State (replacing the status of registered consignor under Article 4(10) of Council Directive 2008/118/EC).
Tax warehouse statistics do not include tax-free permits for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels analogous to tax warehouse permits.
The distillery produces ethyl alcohol at a reduced rate of 50% tax (14,300 CZK/hl ethanol) – fruit spirits for growers. It is not a tax warehouse and the permit to operate is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.
The reduced tax rate may be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per farmer's household for personal consumption during the production period (July-June).
The registers kept by the distillery operators and made available to the tax authorities must contain information on the producer, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.
The authorised receiver for the re-admission of selected products and the authorised receiver for the one-off admission of selected products shall, subject to the authorisation of the tax authority and the conditions laid down, be entitled to receive or re-receive selected products in a conditional system shipped from another Member State on a one-off basis.
The beneficiary is not a tax warehouse operator and may not store or dispatch the selected products under the duty suspension arrangement.
The user of selected products exempt from tax is a legal or natural person who receives and uses, or according to § 52a or § 53 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll. sells selected products exempt from tax to another user; Users have the status of tax subjects without the obligation to register for tax.
Acceptance and use of selected exempt products shall be subject to a final authorisation only from the supplier indicated in the authorisation.
On the basis of the authorisation, the exempt mineral oils may be sold to another holder of the authorisation for use or to a user who is entitled to use mineral oils without authorisation.
Tax-exempt mineral oils may be sold without a licence in cases provided for by law, such as:
waste oils in quantities of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year if the user manufactured them himself or if they were produced by him;
selected exempt mineral oils in unit packets of not more than 20 litres intended for purposes other than motor propulsion or heat production and simultaneously intended for sale to the final consumer.
Selected exempt products may be transported with proof of exemption.
The distributor of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging is entitled to sell or otherwise transfer ethyl alcohol put into free circulation after compulsory registration with the tax authorities.
The storekeeper of raw tobacco shall be entitled to store raw tobacco for purposes other than the manufacture of tobacco products, subject to registration with the tax authorities and to the conditions laid down.
A person handling special mineral oils shall be entitled to acquire, sell or otherwise transfer special mineral oils in bulk or in packages of more than 220 litres, subject to registration with the tax authorities and subject to the conditions laid down.
On the basis of the issued concession and registration of the tax administrator, the fuel distributor is entitled to sell fuel on the territory of the Czech Republic under specified conditions, with the exception of the sale of fuel from a petrol station.
The transport of the fuel must be accompanied by a tax document, a sales note or a transport document, or a distribution plan and bottling slips.
These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent to the tax authorities before the transport begins.
The service station operator is the owner of the fuel sold at the service station.
Petrol stations are places where the sale or supply of fuel to the fuel tank is generally permitted under the authorisation of the Construction Authority.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade records petrol stations and their operators in the following subdivisions: registered – normal sale or issue of fuel usually for fuel tanks of vehicles; with a defined access – operation usually in various business premises (e.g. quarries, sawmills, agricultural farms, transport organisations, construction yards), sales are made here for the other party on a limited basis based on specific contractual relations; non-public – fuel dispensing points for the operators' own consumption only.
A service station is not a construction or installation in the form of a service tank placed in operation (e.g. on a chassis) if the fuel is supplied only for own use.
Operating tanks are not subject to authorisation by the tax administrator and are not registered.
Natural and legal persons may, subject to authorisation by the tax authorities, buy, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases put into free circulation for resale.
They must also be authorised when they purchase or procure liquefied petroleum gases for their own consumption of more than 20 tonnes per calendar year.
Administrative tasks in the Czech Republic
Tax control is a set of actions. Tax inspections shall be carried out on tax obligations, claims made by the taxpayer or other circumstances relevant to the correct determination and determination of the tax relating to a single tax procedure.
Tax control may be carried out jointly for more than one tax procedure of a single tax entity.
Repeated tax inspections may be carried out only under the conditions and justifications laid down by law at the time the inspection is initiated.
The tax inspection is carried out within the three-year tax assessment period, which is extended by one year under the conditions laid down by law (e.g. filing of additional tax proceedings, initiation of criminal proceedings in connection with the tax in question), or is suspended (judicial proceedings, international cooperation).
The tax assessment period shall end no later than 10 years after the deadline for making a proper tax claim.
There is no obligation for the tax authority to carry out a tax inspection of each tax entity.
The commencement of the tax inspection suspends the time limits for the possibility of filing a supplementary tax return or additional statement by the taxpayer (Section 141 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.) and restarts the time limit for the determination of the tax (Section 148 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.).
On the basis of its result, the tax may be levied ex officio.
Local investigation is an individual, time-limited act (one day) in which the tax administrator searches for evidence and searches premises, goods, documents, records, means of transport and transport packaging at the premises of tax subjects and other persons involved in the tax administration, in a place outside the premises of the tax administrator (e.g. at a tax entity, at a point of sale, on the way during transport).
The tax administrator is entitled to borrow documents and items, to take samples or to secure them.
On the basis of the results of the local investigation, the tax cannot be assessed separately, but the taxpayer may be required to submit a supplementary tax return (Article 145(2) of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).
Checking EMCS traffic data is not a local investigation.
Orders for alcohol marking control tapes can only be placed by a registered person obliged to mark alcohol to the tax authorities of the locally competent place of marking and are made by means of intelligent forms which are automatically imported into the application of the register of alcohol markers.
The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the ordered amount of control tapes and orders the production.
He does not oversee the production of surveillance tapes.
Production is provided by the State Printing House, state enterprise.
The purchaser of the control tapes receives the control tapes from the tax administrator of the locally competent place of marking.
Ordering tobacco stickers to mark cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and smoking tobacco fulfils the function of a tax return.
The value of the tobacco sticker corresponds to the amount of the tax liability, and the purchaser of the tobacco stickers is obliged to pay their value within 60 days from the date of their removal from the tax authority.
The purchaser is obliged to calculate the value corresponding to the tax liability of the tobacco labels ordered in the order itself.
This period shall apply only if the value of the tobacco labels is guaranteed.
The order for tobacco stickers shall be made on a form established by the Ministry of Finance in writing or via a data box with the option of using intelligent forms.
The production of tobacco stickers is carried out by the State Printing House, a state-owned company.
The authorized tax administrator, which is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region (territorial workplace Kutná Hora), ensures the purchase and transport of tobacco stickers to the tax administrator, who further distributes them and further checks their transport, storage and use at the customers.
Tax claims include regular tax returns, supplementary and corrective tax returns, including orders for tobacco stickers, filed by tax subjects.
Excluded is not the declaration of tax under customs procedure on the basis of customs declarations and the claim for refund of: mineral oils used for the production of heat, other petrol used in the course of a business other than for the production of heat or the propulsion of engines, mineral oils used for primary agricultural production.
The fines imposed include an administrative procedure for dealing with established infringements, involving a series of consecutive administrative actions. The International Exchange of Information on Tax Entities (ELO) within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes place in the form of: a request for administrative cooperation, a response to a request for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, an event report, an inspection report.
Transport under the conditional exemption regime between the Czech Republic and EU Member States – the Czech Customs Office is the tax administrator of the receiving or sending tax warehouse or the authorized recipient.
Performance indicators in SR
Authorisation and registration for activities in Slovakia
The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is mainly ensured by the customs offices and the excise tax department of the Customs and Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic, whose procedure in the administration of excise duties is regulated by the individual laws on excise duties and the Tax Code.
These laws stipulate not only the scope of the authority for the CÚ and FR SR in the administration of excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax subjects in connection with the registration or payment of excise duty.
The biggest year-on-year increase in tax subjects (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, which was due to an increase in issued permits within tax warehouses, an increase in registrations of authorised receivers for re-admission and the registration of a large number of user enterprises.
The legislation clarified the transport of certain bulk mineral oils, as well as the notification obligation if they are transported in bulk or in packages of more than 150 litres and 230 litres respectively, and also extended the list of mineral oils subject to control and procedure during transport to other goods, such as anti-knocking products, oxidation inhibitors, bituminous inhibitors, viscosity enhancers, anti-corrosion products.
A mandatory indication of the kinematic viscosity of lubricating oils has been introduced.
An approximation of the registration process with selected tax entities in the sense of national legislation in the Slovak Republic is given in the following parts of the document.
Tax warehouse operator
Under the national legislation of the Slovak Republic, when registering a tax warehouse operator in all objects of excise duties, a person who wishes to operate a tax warehouse must simultaneously apply for registration and issue of a permit to operate a tax warehouse.
The resulting decision in the registration process is the certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, by which the tax warehouse operator acquires legal personality for all tax warehouses.
At the same time, the CA issues a tax warehouse operating permit which entitles the tax warehouse operator to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under the duty suspension arrangement.
In the event that the tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in more than one location, the tax administrator issues a separate tax warehouse operating permit for each tax warehouse.
The movement of excise goods under suspension of duty is monitored electronically through the EMCS.
A unique reference code is generated for each shipment, the so-called
The ARC code under which the traffic can be monitored online and therefore in real time.
If the tax warehouse operator is also the person authorised to distribute the spirit, he shall notify electronically to the CA the commercial name of the consumer packaging of the spirit, the volume and volume concentration of the spirit in the consumer packaging of the spirit and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free circulation, at the latest on the date of its release.
Registered Sender
A registered consignor is a special type of taxable person who cannot also be registered as a tax warehouse operator at the same time, even if he dispatches an excise item under a duty suspension arrangement after its release for free circulation.
Under the national legislation of the Slovak Republic, when registering a registered consignor as part of all excise duties, a person who wishes to dispatch an excise item under a duty suspension arrangement after it has been placed under the ‘free circulation’ customs procedure must simultaneously apply to the CA for registration and authorisation to dispatch an excise item under that arrangement.
The CA issues a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty and at the same time also issues an authorisation to dispatch the excise goods under the duty suspension arrangement after their release for free circulation.
Growing spirit
The basic task for the operation of the distillery distillery is to obtain a licence for the production of alcohol in the distillery factory from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.
However, the authorisation from the Ministry alone does not entitle the holder of the authorisation to operate the distillery.
In order to operate a distillery, a person must submit to the CA an application for registration and the issue of a certificate of registration of the distillery operator.
The CA issues a registration certificate for the relevant excise duty, which also entitles the operator of the distillery to produce ethyl alcohol in the distillery.
The purpose of the distillery is to provide services to growers.
Growing liquor cannot be a tax warehouse.
The legislature allows a reduced tax rate of 50% of the basic tax rate, i.e. 540 €/hl, to be applied to alcohol produced in the distillery.
The reduced rate of duty shall apply to ethyl alcohol produced in a distilled distillery up to a maximum of 43 litres per producer and his household per production period in the tax territory.
The production period runs from 1 July of the current year to 30 June of the following year.
The production period is not the same as the calendar year and it is therefore possible to apply a reduced rate of duty to the ethyl alcohol produced more than once in one calendar year, since the alcohol is produced in two production periods.
This is the production of ethyl alcohol outside the suspensive regime, which means in practice that the ethyl alcohol produced is in free circulation for tax purposes.
The grower pays the distiller not only the excise duty and value added tax, but also the price for the services provided.
The grower's distillery shall issue the grower with a removal order, which shall serve not only as proof of the origin and method of acquisition of the alcohol, but also of payment of excise duty.
The transport of ethyl alcohol thus produced is not subject to monitoring by the tax authorities.
Consumer packaging importer
National legislation allows persons intending to import consumer packages of alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third country in the course of their business and to place them in free tax circulation in the tax territory to apply to the CA for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.
The importer of consumer packaging does not register for the relevant excise duty, but the CA issues him with a certificate of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.
That certificate entitles the importer to import consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol or consumer packaging of cigarettes from the territory of a third State.
At the same time, before issuing the control stamps, it must lodge a tax guarantee equal to the amount of tax attributable to the quantities of ethyl alcohol or cigarettes it wishes to put into free circulation.
The importer of the consumer packaging must put into free circulation only the consumer packaging bearing the control mark.
For this reason, they must present to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the control marks exported to the territory of the third State.
On importation, the importer shall be obliged to have the number of control marks imported back from the territory of the third State certified by the customs office of importation.
When importing consumer packaging, the importer proceeds in the sense of customs legislation, where the customs debt also includes the amount of excise duty.
In the event of release for free circulation of the consumer packaging, the tax security lodged shall be returned to the importer or may be used to pay the customs debt.
The importer of consumer packaging is not a tax warehouse.
Where the importer of a consumer packaging of spirit is also the person authorised to distribute the spirit, he shall notify electronically to the CA the commercial name of the consumer packaging of the spirit, the volume and volume concentration of the spirit in the consumer packaging of the spirit and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free circulation for tax purposes, at the latest on the date of its release.
Seller of consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation
In order to monitor the movement of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation and eliminate tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute for sellers of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
A person wishing to hold a sales licence must apply to the CA for a licence and fulfil the legal conditions (business licence; good repute in relation to intentional economic offences; has not had its sales licence withdrawn for 10 years; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).
As the goods are packaged for consumption in free circulation for tax purposes, no accompanying document is required for the transport of those goods.
An invoice, for example, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation, is sufficient to prove how the consumer packaging of the alcohol is purchased.
The holder of the authorisation shall keep, for each establishment, for each calendar month, a record of the number of units of alcohol wrapped for consumption, the number of units of alcohol wrapped for consumption, the stock of alcohol in alcohol wrapped for consumption on the last day of the month and a record of shortages or surpluses in the number of packages of alcohol accepted and issued.
The holder of the authorisation shall be obliged to purchase the alcohol in consumer packaging or otherwise to purchase it in the course of business only from the person authorised to distribute it.
Distributor of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol
In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free circulation and eliminate tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute, the distributor of consumer packaging of alcohol.
A person wishing to hold a distribution authorisation must apply to the CA for a distribution authorisation.
The applicant must fulfil the statutory conditions (trade licence for a commercial trade; a storage area exceeding 200 m2; an annual turnover of at least €100,000 from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol or a paid-up capital of at least €100,000; a minimum of 10 employees; has no arrears vis-à-vis the customs office; has no arrears in compulsory contributions; good repute in relation to intentional economic offences; has not had its authorisation to sell withdrawn for 10 years; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).
As the goods are packaged for consumption in free circulation for tax purposes, no accompanying document is required for the transport of those goods.
An invoice, for example, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation, is sufficient to prove how the consumer packaging of the alcohol is purchased.
The holder of a distribution authorisation shall keep, for each establishment, for each calendar month, a record of the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol accepted, the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol issued, the stock of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol on the last day of the month and a record of shortages or surpluses in the number of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol accepted and issued.
The holder of the distribution authorisation shall be obliged to purchase the alcohol in consumer packaging only from another person authorised to distribute it.
The person authorised to distribute shall report the data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.
Fuel Seller
In order to monitor fuel in free circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely the fuel vendor.
There is no specific regulation governing petrol stations in the territory of the Slovak Republic.
That is why petrol stations are incorporated in national legislation as fuel sellers.
A person wishing to sell petrol, diesel or LPG for final consumption in free tax circulation in the course of a business activity in the tax territory is required to apply to the CA for a sales licence before commencing the sale and to provide proof that the storage facility is verified and equipped with a suitable verified measuring device enabling the quantity of mineral oil to be measured at reception and at issue, and the tank must comply with technical standards.
If the seller of the fuel is a tax warehouse operator, authorised consignee or registered consignor, the CA will also issue an authorisation to sell the fuel to automatically registered persons.
The fuel vendor is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep a record of purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG in a calendar month and also to notify the CA of the new fuel supplier (distributor).
A fuel vendor is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.
As the fuel is in free circulation for tax purposes, no accompanying document is required for the transport of those goods.
However, when the fuel is delivered by means of a car tank, the distributor prints a so-called stationary from the measuring device installed in the car tank when the fuel is pumped to the dealer.
That document shall contain, in addition to the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the vehicle assigned by the traffic inspectorate.
An invoice, for example, which also contains the fuel distributor number allocated by the tax authorities, is sufficient to prove how the fuel was acquired.
In the exercise of fiscal supervision of mineral oils, the tax authority in the territory of the Slovak Republic records tax evasion connected with the transport of this type of goods.
Above all, it is an effort to avoid roadside checks during transport, so hauliers use secondary roads, bypassing the toll collection system because of the more difficult monitoring of actual traffic.
The transport of mineral oils in converted double-bottomed tanks is also carried out.
It is often the case that illegal traffic is accompanied by a vehicle which reports possible mobile patrols to the haulier in order to change the route and avoid a roadside check.
Fuel is also mixed with light fuel oils or waste oils.
Fuel distributor
In order to monitor fuel in free circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of taxpayer, namely the fuel distributor, has been introduced.
A person who wishes to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in free circulation in the tax territory in the course of a business activity shall, before distribution begins, apply to the customs office for a distribution authorisation and provide proof that the storage facility is verified and equipped with an appropriate verified measuring device, as well as a list of suppliers and customers.
The fuel distributor is required, among other legal obligations, to keep a separate account for each establishment of the petrol, diesel or LPG purchased and sold in a calendar month.
A fuel distributor is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.
A fuel distributor may sell in the tax territory only to a fuel distributor, a registered person or a fuel consumer.
However, when delivering fuel by means of a car tank, the distributor prints a so-called stamp from the measuring device embedded in the car tank to the fuel seller or to the fuel consumer when the fuel is pumped.
That document shall contain, in addition to the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the vehicle assigned by the traffic inspectorate.
As the fuel is in free circulation for tax purposes, no accompanying document is required for the transport of the goods.
An invoice, for example, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor or registered person, allocated by the tax authorities, is sufficient to prove the method of acquiring the fuel.
Fuel Consumers
Fuel consumers have a special place in national legislation.
A person who purchases petrol, diesel or LPG in free circulation for his own consumption in the tax territory and stores that mineral oil in a storage facility of 15 000 litres or more shall be required to notify the customs office no later than before the first placing in the storage facility.
Consumers of fuel shall be entered in the register by the customs office.
In addition to the legal facts, the latter must indicate the location of the storage facility.
In practice, these are large transport companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.
Storage equipment must be verified and fitted with a measuring device enabling the quantity of propellant to be measured at reception and dispensing (gauge, measuring rod).
The tank shall meet technical standards.
Fuel consumers must purchase fuel only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.
As the fuel is in free tax circulation, no accompanying document is required for the transport.
However, when the fuel is delivered by means of a car tank, the distributor prints a so-called stamp from the measuring device installed in the car tank when the fuel is pumped to the consumer.
That document shall contain, in addition to the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the vehicle assigned by the traffic inspectorate.
An invoice, for example, which also contains the fuel distributor number allocated by the tax authorities, is sufficient to prove how the fuel was acquired.
In the exercise of fiscal supervision of mineral oils, the tax authority in the territory of the Slovak Republic records tax evasion connected with the transport of this type of goods.
Small independent brewery
The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer in the course of the business and fulfils the legal conditions.
Provided that the statutory conditions are met, a small independent brewery may apply a reduced rate of tax, i.e. EUR 2,652 per hl/per cent of the volume of actual alcohol content.
The annual production of beer is limited to quantities of up to 200 000 hl of beer.
As the beer is produced outside the suspensive regime, the transport does not require an accompanying document as it is in free circulation for tax purposes.
A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.
In practice, they are small family businesses that also operate restaurants or saloons in which they offer their own-produced beer for sale.
Administrative tasks in Slovakia
This sub-chapter describes the performance of tax supervision of the administration of excise duties for selected tax entities in the sense of national legislation in the Slovak Republic.
The biggest year-on-year increase in administrative operations (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, due to more EMCS traffic.
On the contrary, the biggest decrease was recorded in 2014, by up to 4.3%, which was due to fewer completed tax inspections and fewer filed tax returns.
That decrease concerned legislative changes.
Tax controls
By carrying out tax audits, the CA identifies or verifies the facts decisive for the correct determination of the tax.
When performing a tax audit, the employees of the CA are required to produce a tax audit mandate which includes, among other things, the purpose and subject of the audit and the scope of the audited tax years.
In practice, this means that the audited tax period can be one month, but also more tax periods.
The extent of audited tax periods is determined by the CA.
The tax inspection begins with the writing of the report on the commencement of the tax inspection.
The CA will confirm receipt of the documents.
The CA is obliged to return the borrowed documents within 30 days from the completion of the tax audit.
The CA employee shall draw up a report of the tax inspection.
If the tax inspection reveals a difference in the sum that the audited taxpayer should have paid, reported or claimed a refund, the CA shall, together with the protocol, also send the audited taxpayer a letter of formal notice to comment on the findings in the report.
The tax inspection shall end on the date of receipt of the report.
The time limit for carrying out a tax audit shall be no more than one year from the date of its initiation.
Tax inspections of registered persons and selected registered persons shall be carried out as necessary, but at least once before the date of expiry of the right to determine the tax, which is 5 years.
DG SR issued an internal management act which modified the above deadlines due to the uniform procedure of the tax administration in the territory of the Slovak Republic.
Local investigation
Local investigation is the activity of the tax administrator, in which it searches for evidence, examines and ascertains facts that are necessary for the purposes of tax administration.
The local investigation is recorded by the CA employee and a copy is given to the taxpayer.
In carrying out a local investigation, the CA employee has the right to unrestricted access to land, operational buildings, rooms and locations, including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.
The accounting for the quantity of ethyl alcohol produced shall be established by means of a local investigation.
The established facts are the basis for carrying out a tax audit.
Also in the course of local investigations, the CA is entitled to take samples as well as to secure the item.
DG SR issued an internal management act regulating the performance of tax supervision and local investigations for individual subjects of excise duties in order to unify the procedures of the tax administration.
Permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses
With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1 May 2004, there was also a change in the administration of excise duties.
The need for more efficient spending of state budget funds in the administration of excise duty on alcohol, the improvement of the business environment in the area and the introduction of legislative instruments for more effective suppression of the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in 2004 in connection with the administration of excise duties.
One of the measures introduced by the new legislative amendment was not only the transfer of the excise tax administration from the tax authorities to the customs authorities, but also the introduction of the need for the tax administration to be present in the alcohol tax warehouse.
In the territory of the Slovak Republic, national legislation defines exhaustively that it is only possible to receive, issue, produce or process alcohol in a tax warehouse in the presence of an employee of the CA.
This shall not apply to a tax warehouse which receives, stores or dispatches ethyl alcohol only in a consumable container of ethyl alcohol.
At the same time, the CA is obliged to secure employees in the tax warehouse in order not to restrict the receipt, supply, production or processing of alcohol.
The tax warehouse operator is obliged to provide working environment conditions for CA employees.
On the basis of the contract concluded with FR SR for the premises provided, the CA pays the tax warehouse operator the rental costs on a monthly basis.
In a tax warehouse for the production, processing or storage of ethyl alcohol, the production facilities for the storage of ethyl alcohol must be adapted so that the quantities of ethyl alcohol produced, processed ethyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol stored, including the stocks of ethyl alcohol and the alcohol contained therein, can be ascertained at any time.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Where ethyl alcohol is not accepted, issued, produced or processed in a tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee and shall secure that area by means of a customs office seal.
In practice, however, this option is not used very often, as tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs employee to their advantage.
Some tax warehouse operators use a legal option within the meaning of Act No 467/2002 Coll. on the production and marketing of ethyl alcohol and use the production facilities for the production of ethyl alcohol in the distillery for cultivation burning and also for the purposes of the distillery for distillates, which must be a tax warehouse.
Approximately 250 customs officers provide permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.
Issuing of vouchers for the collection of alcohol control stamps
The basic act for the collection of control stamps is to send an application to the customs office for the allocation of a registration sampling number and to issue a voucher for the collection of control stamps for ethyl alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages, which are ethyl alcohol, are goods of Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength exceeding 1,2 % vol.
The control mark is intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
A sealed container filled with ethyl alcohol intended for direct human consumption is considered to be a consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.
Consumer packaging falling within CN codes 2207 and 2208 may be put into free circulation in the tax territory only if it bears a control mark.
Only the operator of the tax warehouse, the authorised consignee and the importer of the consumer packaging, who will place it in free circulation for tax purposes, may mark the consumer packaging.
The control mark shall contain, inter alia, an identification number consisting of a 14-digit numerical character. The identification number shall contain the registration number (1st-6th digit), the volume of ethyl alcohol (7th-11th digit) and the volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer packaging (12th-14th digit).
Original alcohol control mark model:
The CA shall assign the registration number to each purchaser of the control mark separately.
Only a control mark, the identification number of which corresponds to the volume of the consumer packaging, the volume concentration of the alcohol in the consumer packaging and the customer's control mark, may be used to indicate the packaging of the alcohol for consumption.
At the end of 2014, national legislation introduced a new information system for inspection marks.
The aim of the new information system for control stamps was to simplify and computerise the system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control stamps for the labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.
Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee, the importer of the consumer packaging and the consignee (buyer) of the alcohol may mark the consumer packaging of the alcohol.
A purchaser of control stamps who wishes to collect control stamps under the ‘new system’ must apply to the customs office for the issue of control stamps electronically.
Through the electronic system, the purchaser of control stamps is obliged to apply for their issue, to notify data resulting from national legislation of the Slovak Republic and to keep a register of control stamps.
The number of pieces of control stamps ordered shall not be less than 500 pieces or a multiple thereof.
The tax administrator also communicates with the customers of control stamps via the electronic control stamp system, especially when notifying the number of control stamps that the buyer of control stamps can remove, or when determining the date of receipt of control stamps by the buyer of control stamps in the printer.
The purchaser of control stamps is obliged to deposit funds corresponding to the price of control stamps into the tax administrator's account before taking over the control stamps, which he can collect and the quantity of which is notified to him by the customs office.
The price of the check mark takes into account the amount of printer compensation. However, it does not take into account the amount of excise duty.
The state enterprise Mincovna Kremnice is entitled to print the inspection marks.
FR SR performs tax supervision over the handling of control stamps and their disposal in the printing works.
The FR SR is obliged to ensure the presence of a member of the staff of the Financial Directorate in the printing works when handling control stamps.
FR SR ensures the sale of control stamps to the customer of control stamps in the printer.
Check stamps can only be removed at the printer from an employee of the Financial Directorate.
Issue of vouchers for the collection of control marks for tobacco products
The purchaser of the control mark must ask the CA to assign a registration number and issue a voucher for the collection of the control mark.
Consumer packs of cigarettes may be put into free circulation for tax purposes only if they bear a control mark.
It is only possible to mark consumer cigarette packs with a control mark in a company that produces cigarettes.
Only a tax warehouse operator, a beneficiary or an importer of tobacco products who wishes to place tobacco products in free circulation in the tax territory may be a purchaser of control marks.
Only a control mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of cigarettes, the particulars of which correspond to the relevant price of the cigarettes, the number of cigarettes in the package, the length of the cigarettes, the character of the valid tax rate and the registration take-off number.
Consumer packs of cigarettes may be sold for final consumption only at the price indicated on the control mark.
At the end of 2014, national legislation introduced a new information system for inspection marks.
The aim of the new information system for control marks was to simplify and computerise the system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control marks for the marking of consumer packages of tobacco, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.
A purchaser of control stamps who wishes to collect control stamps under the ‘new system’ must apply to the customs office for the issue of control stamps electronically.

A tax warehouse operator or an importer of tobacco products may mark consumer tobacco packages with a control mark.
A tax warehouse operator, importer of tobacco products or authorised consignee may mark consumer packages of cigars or cigarillos with a control mark.
Only the control mark shall be used to indicate the consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars or cigarillos, the particulars of which correspond to the character of the validity of the rate of excise duty.
Consumer packaging of cigarettes may be marked with a control mark only in the undertaking which manufactured them.
The number of pieces of control stamps ordered shall not be less than 500 pieces or a multiple thereof.
Within three working days at the latest, the CA shall electronically notify the purchaser of the control stamps of the number of control stamps which he may withdraw, the price of the control stamps and the account number of the FR SR.
The CA may reduce the number of pieces of inspection stamps ordered if there are circumstances on the basis of which it can reasonably be assumed that a tax infringement may occur.
FR SR will determine the date of receipt of control stamps by the purchaser of control stamps, but no later than within 10 days.
The date of receipt of the control stamps shall be notified by the Slovak Ministry via the electronic control stamp system to the purchaser of the control stamps.
Surveillance stamps are issued by the tax office exclusively in the printing works, but only after the receipt of the funds corresponding to their price to the relevant account indicated in the customs office electronic notification.
The purchaser of control marks is obliged to keep a separate register of control marks in the electronic system of control marks for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.
Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the ELO and SPD systems unit of the Excise Department of the Slovak DG is responsible for ensuring the exchange of information following a request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the competent financial authorities.
These are, in particular, requests for verification of bodies within the excise administration, requests for information concerning the administration of excise duties, as well as requests for confirmation of information from the SEED database.
The exchange of applications shall take place in electronic form within the EMCS.
The following actions are included in administrative cooperation between EU Member States: requests for administrative cooperation (request for verification, request for information on excise administration, request for confirmation of registration in the SEED); response to a request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; event report; check report.

In Slovakia, there is a registered consignor institute, which is included among tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.
In the Slovak Republic, with a reduced rate of excise duty on ethyl alcohol, 43 litres can be burned in the case of cultivation burning.
In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the reduced rate of tax on ethyl alcohol can only be applied to 30 litres.
A distillery in the Slovak Republic must be authorised not only by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic, but also by the tax authorities.
In the Czech Republic, only the Ministry of Agriculture allows distilled spirits.
In Slovakia, besides the tax warehouse operator, the import of consumer packaging of alcohol is also carried out by the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol.
Authorisation of the importer shall be subject to registration of the applicant with the excise authorities.
In the Czech Republic, the import of consumer packaging of alcohol does not require any special permission from the tax administrator.
In Slovakia, the sale of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol is subject to the issuance of a tax authority permit for the seller.
The seller of consumer packaging of alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep records of, among other things, purchases and sales.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not issue any permit for final sellers of consumer packaging of alcohol, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of alcohol by the trade licensing office; The final seller does not keep any special records.
In the Slovak Republic, the seller of the fuel must have permission from the tax authorities to sell it.
National legislation in Slovakia does not regulate any special regulation of petrol stations, all activities related to petrol stations are regulated only in the Excise Tax Act on Mineral Oils.
In the Czech Republic, petrol stations are regulated by a special law on fuel, but the tax administrator does not issue any permit for the sale of fuel.
Gas stations are registered and a list of them is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
In Slovakia, it is not technically possible to obtain a list of petrol stations from the financial management system.
In SR, the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities has increased significantly since 2012.
This increase was due to a legislative change in that period.
In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits decreased significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of a deposit for fuel distributors.
Administrative tasks
In the Slovak Republic, substantive legislation stipulates the obligation to exercise tax control over selected tax entities.
This issue is further specified in an internal management act issued by the Slovak Ministry of Finance due to the application of the uniform procedure of tax administrators in the Slovak Republic.
In the Czech Republic, substantive legislation does not regulate the obligation to carry out tax inspections; procedural law only provides for the possibility to carry out inspections at the latest by the deadline for tax assessment.
The reason for the large differences in the number of tax inspections and local investigations carried out in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is the fact that the internal management act of the Slovak Ministry of Finance specifies in which cases and within what time limits the tax administrator must carry out a tax inspection, while in the Czech Republic the correctness of the declared amount of excise duty or its refund is verified mainly by a local investigation.
The number of comparable administrative operations in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 as a result of an increase in the number of EMCS traffic and also as a result of an increase in the number of submitted tax returns.
In SR, the number of administrative operations showed a slightly increasing trend between 2012 and 2015, which was influenced by the increasing number of EMCS traffic and the decrease in the number of tax returns.
Evaluation
The large differences between the numbers of comparable permits and the registration of tax entities were reflected in the different legislative arrangements.
The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the individual years of the audited period.
In Slovakia, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds of the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for approximately the same number of administrative operations.
From this it can be concluded that the SR is more focused on carrying out administrative operations by the tax authorities, e.g. carrying out physical tax supervision.
In the Czech Republic, emphasis is placed more on remote surveillance, e.g. tracking devices, immediate data transmission via a web interface and risk analysis.
Electronicisation of administrative procedures
Electronicization of administrative operations in the Czech Republic
The tax return can be filed via the data box.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced the so-called interactive forms of tax returns, which, however, can no longer be processed automatically.
The data must also be credited to the personal tax account of the taxpayer.
The benefit is a reduction in the error rate of the submitted tax returns (DAPs), which saves the actions of the tax administrator related to the procedure for corrections of erroneously filed DAPs.
The DG is working on a new application for electronic processing of DAP.
Smart forms can also be used to: submit tax or business registration applications and notifications of data changes, claim refund rights, fulfil reporting obligations for handling special mineral oils, handling raw tobacco and fulfilling biofuel obligations.
The handling of control tapes is recorded by tax subjects in the information system ORO WebClient, which is available for registered entities for registration by the tax administrator of specified data.
Transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under the conditional exemption regime must be carried out in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality in the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).
Transport of selected products in free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic may always be carried out with a document proving their taxation, a document exempting them from excise duty, a decision of the customs office to place selected products under a customs procedure, a simplified accompanying document or another decision on the assessment of excise duty.
The required content of the data is determined by law.
In order to facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.).
This allows the paper form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents, which are sent via the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic to the data warehouse, where each such document is assigned a unique 12-digit identification code (JIK).
The JIK serves the purpose of control by the customs authorities on the way and prevents repeated transport on the same document.
For the largest operator of the tax warehouse of fuel in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of fuel into free tax circulation, CS ČR has on-line access to the electronic registration system, into which the entity automatically stores the issued tax documents.
CS ČR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. an electronic system for registration and monitoring of transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.
This system should make use of 70% of the current functional EMCS specification.
The advantage will be a user-friendly environment for both declarants and customs officers.
It will also be linked to the Global Guarantee Scheme, the Tax Entity Register or the Risk Analysis System.
The system should provide an overview of traffic in free circulation between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of documentary evidence without registration and the sharing of serial numbers through simplified accompanying documents.
The risks of the current procedure of recording the transport of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in misuse of the simplified accompanying document, repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.
Electronization of administrative operations in the Slovak Republic
In the administration of excise duties, the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic uses electronic communication when monitoring the movement of goods in the EMCS system under the conditional exemption regime, check marks, filing of tax returns and also when registering and registering tax entities.
One-way electronic communication between tax subjects and the tax administrator was also introduced in 2014, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.
In the framework of electronic communication, the taxpayer has access to a personal internet zone, the so-called electronic personal mailbox, which is designed for communication with the financial administration, after entering the access data.
Within this zone, the taxpayer has access to an electronic mailroom through which he submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents relating to the administration of excise duties.
However, electronic communication via the personal internet zone does not concern all tax subjects.
National legislation defines tax entities that are obliged to communicate electronically with the tax administrator.
These are mainly VAT payers, tax advisers representing the tax entity and lawyers representing the tax entity.
During the audit, the SAO of the Slovak Republic also addressed the issue of the scope of computerisation of the administration of excise duties.
These were only fully electronic transactions, namely tax returns and electronic communication within ELO.
Apart from EMCS transport, there has been an increase in the computerisation of selected comparable administrative operations, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
In the Slovak Republic, the fully computerised processing of the tax return is already in place, from its submission to the registration of the tax liability.
In the Czech Republic, electronic processing of tax returns is not set.
In the Czech Republic, it is possible for tax subjects to insert on the website mandatory documents for individual transport operations in free tax circulation.
In the future, the declaration of transport in free tax circulation in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system is being prepared.
Evaluation
The system of reporting of transport in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax supervision, thus eliminating transport of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid in violation of the legislation.
This can be recommended as good practice.

Due to good practice in Slovakia in the field of electronic tax returns, the SAO of Slovakia and the SAO of the Czech Republic recommend completing the electronic processing of tax returns in the Czech Republic.
Analysis of changes in organisational structure and staffing in the area of excise duties
The organization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic has undergone major changes.
Organizational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic since 1 January 2013 consists of the General Directorate of Customs and Customs Offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.
The DG is the accounting unit for the entire customs administration.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out the comprehensive administration of excise duties since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.
CS ČR also performs:
(a) control:
ശശ in the field of road transport (weighing of trucks, payment of road user charges, fulfilment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road freight transport and in matters of international passenger transport),
ശശ waste and packaging material management,
ശശ the safety of imported food,
ശശ in the field of consumer protection and protection of intellectual property rights,
ശശ employing foreigners,
b) Customs administration – a comprehensive application of customs legislation, trade policy measures and formalities for the import and export of goods;
(c) the collection and recovery of pecuniary payments imposed by other public authorities under shared management;
(d) activities of the police authority (designated customs authorities) in proceedings concerning offences committed in breach of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administrator.
Although the scope of competences (concurrent control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there are economies of scale as the public administration does not have to spend the costs for the status of the control group for each subject of control separately.
At the same time, the administrative burden of the auditees is reduced by the re-inspection.
10 Since 1 December 2016, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic also exercises powers to verify compliance with obligations in the registration of sales (Section 2(2) of Act No. 112/2016 Coll., on the Registration of Sales) and, since 1 January 2017, to supervise compliance with the Act and the conditions of operation of gambling, including the imposition of penalties (Section 116 of Act No. 186/2016 Coll., on Gambling).
Within the project Modernization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed the three-stage structure to two-stage structure with effect from 1 January 2013, while the central link of the procedure (Customs Directorates) was abolished.
The DG spent about CZK 51 million on the project (i.e. about €2,031,000).
CS CR since 1 January 2013 consists of the DG and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.
Customs offices and their competences are determined by law, the administration of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial offices.
The territorial offices are the internal organisational units of the customs offices.
The Ministry of Finance is authorised by decree to establish and abolish territorial offices and determine their material scope.
The legislation does not provide for any competence for the territorial workplace; The territorial offices shall exercise the powers of the customs office on its behalf.
Organizational structure until December 31, 2012
Organizational structure from 1. 1. 2013
Until 31 December 2012, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the DG, eight DGs and 58 CA units (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 departments and units.
As of 1 January 2016, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the DG and 51 departments in the CA and their territorial offices, as well as by eight departments of the legal department of the DG and by the CA departments providing mobile supervision, i.e. about 60 posts.
The costs of CS ČR most significantly affect wage expenditure.
As a result of the reorganisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there were no savings in staff resources.
The main processes are carried out by customs officers in service under the Law on the service of members of the security forces.
The possibility to reduce the numbers of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, because according to the provisions of Section 42(1) of Act No. 361/2003 Coll., on the employment relationship of members of the security forces, they can be dismissed from the service only in cases exhaustively defined.
Reduction of posts due to organisational changes in the security corps is not a reason for dismissal and the employer is obliged to ensure that the members are assigned appropriate posts within the corps, or to provide posts in another security corps (e.g. the Police of the Czech Republic, the Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise it will transfer them to the reserve for the temporarily non-attached, in which the members of the security forces are entitled to 80% of the average service income according to the law.

Organizational arrangement of the administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic
As part of the 2012-2016 programme declaration, the Government of the Slovak Republic has set as one of its priorities the completion of the reform of the tax administration through the UNITAS programme, which will secure additional budgetary resources by harmonising the collection of taxes, duties and levies and by curbing tax evasion.
In this context, the tax reform was implemented at the central level, which resulted in the merger of the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic into the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the creation of the financial administration.
The Slovak Ministry of Finance was established on 1 January 2012 by Act No. 333/2011 Coll., on State Administration Authorities in the Field of Taxes, Fees and Customs, as amended, as a budgetary organization which has its seat in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the State Budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
FR SR, CÚ and the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No 199/2004 Coll., the Customs Act and amending and supplementing certain Acts, as amended, are customs authorities when they perform tasks according to customs regulations.
Within the meaning of Act No. 333/2011 Coll., on State Administration Authorities in the Field of Taxes, Fees and Customs, as amended, together with the Tax Authorities form the Financial Administration.
The new organisational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, the Competent Centre for Financial Operations, the tax authorities, the Tax Office for selected tax entities, tax office branches, tax office contact points, customs offices, branches of customs offices (branch of the Czech Tax Office, branch of the Czech Tax Office combined, branch of the Czech Customs Office) and customs office stations.
The main mission of the Slovak Ministry of Finance is the effective collection and administration of taxes and duties, i.e. also excise duties, to fulfil the revenue part of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.
The statutory body of the Slovak Ministry of Finance is the President of the Financial Administration, who is appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
The president of the financial administration is responsible to him for the activities of the entire financial administration and therefore also for the activities of the Slovak Ministry of Finance, which he manages and represents in full.
Organizational Structure of the Slovak Ministry since 1. 1. 2012 in abbreviated form
Within all customs offices in the territory of the Slovak Republic, in addition to the branches of customs offices (38 branches) and stations of customs offices (18 stations), the excise department (9 departments) and the legal department (9 departments) also provide excise activities and processes.

Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
In the framework of the organisational structure of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic, 74 organisational units with a total number of 1 300 employees were involved in the administration of excise duties in 2015 in addition to the Slovak Ministry of Finance; These services manage almost 48 000 tax entities.
Within the organisational structure In 2015, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic dealt with the administration of excise duties by approximately 60 organizational units with a total number of 1 011 employees, which are managed by approximately 114 000 tax entities.
In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual activities of the administration of excise duties is divided among several personnel independent departments.
Their mutual coordination and cooperation is addressed through middle and top management.
In the Slovak Republic, the performance of individual activities (registration, tax declaration, tax inspection) in the field of administration of excise duties is divided between the department of excise duties and the branch of the customs office, within which the agenda is often dealt with by the same employees of the tax administrator.
Evaluation
In the Slovak Republic, approximately one third of the number of tax subjects in the total number of employees in the field of administration of excise duties is compared to the situation in the Czech Republic; the impact of the higher number of employees on the efficiency of administration of excise duties is not clear.
EMCS
According to the preamble to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of excise products, the purpose of the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to enable real-time information on the transport and to carry out the prescribed checks, to facilitate the movement of goods within the Community under suspension of excise duty.
When implementing the scheme, Member States should have allowed economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to use these national elements at the lowest possible cost.
Article 3 of the EP and Council Decision allows the inclusion in the EMCS of a national specification, a national database forming part of the system and such hardware or software as the Member State considers necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration.
EMCS in the Czech Republic
Development and functionality of EMCS
In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by a system of registration of selected products (EVV), which was operated from May 2004 until the end of March 2010.
EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1 April 2010 and is continuously updated with European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).
The so-called Customs Module and the Declarant Module were introduced in the Czech Republic.
The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.
In addition to the Community system, in the Czech Republic the EMCS system monitors shipments under the conditional tax exemption regime initiated and terminated in the Czech Republic.
The system provides for the automatic transmission of information to the Registry of Tax Entities following the approval of the notification of the receipt of a consignment intended for a single receipt by the authorised consignee, followed by the invalidation of the authorisation.
The system fully ensures administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO, including sending replies with attachments in any format and providing translations.
It is also possible to accept the manual export termination report in the ECS (in the EU, only the transmission of the automatically generated report is implemented).
The risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.
EMCS will not allow approval of e-AD or receipt notifications without a response from the competent customs authority to the risk profile (risk profile cannot be ignored).
The Declarant module is available for tax subjects free of charge, it takes the form of a web application into which the user logs in with a username and password (coordinates), which are assigned to him after registration with CS ČR.
Any action against the customs module EMCS shall be accompanied by a valid electronic signature in the declarant module EMCS.
The Declarant Module allows tax entities to directly record data on commenced and terminated transport operations under the conditional exemption regime, so that tax entities do not have to spend money to acquire the system.
The national functionalities of the declarant module allow data to be read and stored offline (saving time for frequently used data), to fill in the data of the recipient based on the SEED ID check and to require mandatory completion of data that are optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).
The system also allows to block the securing of excise duty for each consignment sent from the Czech Republic in real time in the corresponding amount of taxable performance up to the time of termination of the transport.
The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by the EMCS.
Without sufficient collateral, it is not possible from the EMCS declarant module to send the e-AD proposal to the CA of dispatch for approval.
Each guarantee has a unique number and contains the ARC of the transport (including the amount of the blocked collateral) for which it was used.
The tax entity can administer its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it can see the actual amount of the blocked and unblocked excise duty guarantee.
Expenditure on the implementation and use of EMCS
The development of EMCS was realized on the basis of eight contracts with fulfilment from 2006 to 2017 in the total amount of CZK 46,791,924.60 (i.e. EUR 1,761,412.56) excluding VAT.
In accordance with the concluded contracts, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e. EUR 1,640,401.10) excluding VAT between 2006 and the end of 2015.
During the audited period, expenditure amounting to CZK 14,545,454 (i.e. EUR 547,438.99) was spent on the EMCS system upgrade.
The amount spent on upgrading EMCS in the audited period and converted into one transport inserted into EMCS amounts on average to 16.49 CZK (i.e. 0.62 €), excluding national transport, this expenditure amounts to 24.40 CZK (i.e. 0.92 €) per transport between the Czech Republic and EU Member States.
EMCS technical support was implemented on the basis of four performance contracts from 2011 to 2017.
By the end of 2015, a total amount of CZK 7,499,675 (i.e. €281,389.77) including value added tax was invoiced.
The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 per transport entered into the EMCS since 2010 is 6.18 CZK (i.e. 0.23 €).
The invoices for both development and technical support related to the national solution and led to the development of the EVV application, which was already operated by the DG before EMCS itself.
The invoices were paid under the programme financing from national sources.
Technical support is invoiced as part of deliveries of services to other applications provided by the supplier for the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
EMCS in SR
The EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor movements of excise goods between Member States under a duty suspension arrangement.
It replaced the accompanying administrative document – SAD, which was used before the system took effect, thus ensuring better control and management of traffic.
It has been introduced in the Slovak Republic since 1 April 2010 and is continuously supplemented by requirements arising from EU legislation.
A unique reference code is generated for each transport, the so-called ‘reference code’.
The ARC code under which the traffic can be monitored online, i.e. in real time.
Development and functionality of EMCS
The EMCS provides for the receipt and dispatch of excise goods only by those taxable persons who are authorised to use the EMCS, thereby greatly reducing the risk of tax evasion.
The greatest development of functionalities occurred in 2011, when EMCS was fully operational (see Annex 6).
Expenditure on the implementation and use of EMCS
The introduction of EMCS was implemented as an additional SysNeD application equipment module and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact cost of its initial application on the Slovak side.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
The aim of the EMCS was to replace a system based on paper-based transport administration.
The benefits of EMCS are a comprehensive overview of intra-EU transport between Member States from the notification of the start of the transport to the end of the transport – a significant reduction in administrative costs for tax administrations and tax subjects to process, transmit and archive documents.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a national functionality was introduced into the EMCS system allowing monitoring of traffic in a conditional system between two locations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, respectively.
In addition, automatic functionality of on-line monitoring and guarantee of excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.
National functionality is also introduced, which monitors the risk of the taxpayer, virtually transportation, followed by a mandatory response from the tax administrator.
SR and the Czech Republic record a comparable number of intra-EU traffic in the EMCS system.
Expenditure spent in the Slovak Republic on upgrading this system, however, was €744,310.01 higher than in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015.
The SAO SR obtained data from the Slovak Ministry on the upgrade of the EMCS system only for the period from 2011, even though the system was introduced and operated earlier.
Despite this, the expenditure spent on upgrading the EMCS system in Slovakia was €188,134.44 higher than the expenditure for introducing and upgrading the EMCS system in approximately ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.
Evaluation
During the audited period, the volume of expenses related to the upgrade of the EMCS system in Slovakia in terms of one transport exceeds by 2.3 times the expenses of the same type in the Czech Republic.
Conclusion
Cooperation between the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic met the objectives.
Both audit institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the system of administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
It was found that, despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences in the two tax systems which affect the efficiency of the administration of excise duties.
In parallel, examples of good practice have been identified that could contribute to reducing tax fraud, which will become increasingly important as tax rates rise.
Procedures to reduce the cost of administering excise duties have also been identified.
Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons, unless mutually coordinated due diligence checks are carried out with the tax administration.
In this respect, the role of supreme audit institutions is irreplaceable.
Report on the results of the parallel inspection of the VAT administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Opening Word
The Lima Declaration of 1977 stresses that supreme audit institutions (SAIs) have the power to audit all public financial operations.
The Declaration calls for tax revenues to be controlled as far as possible.
Organisation The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxation to be one of the most important components of public revenue.
The VI EUROSAI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 addressed the audit of public revenues carried out by the SAI.
The development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue is an important step towards optimising the control activities of the SAI.
This applies in particular to taxation as the largest source of public revenue most susceptible to large losses.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may to some extent be unable to carry out control activities without the cooperation of another State's SAIs.
An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes substantial losses in the revenues of many countries.
In order to combat this crime, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.
SAIs carrying out inspections in this area must be willing to establish closer cooperation between themselves.
It was at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn that the idea arose of carrying out an audit of the administration of value added tax (VAT) and the VIES system in the framework of the cooperation between the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof.
This was followed by careful preparation, with both parties first having to familiarize themselves with the legal environment and procedures in the administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Based on the analysis of this information, a selection of control topics was made for inclusion in the control programme.
Achieving an effective and efficient VAT administration is a long-standing challenge and individual Member States (in particular the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify and make the collection of VAT more transparent.
We believe that the results of our audit can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrations, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of parallel inspections of the VAT administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Inspection number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Object of control:
(CZ) Administration of Value Added Tax after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union
(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004
Objective of control:
(CZ) The aim of the audit operation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the administration of value added tax after the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the EU) connected with the free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, in particular when checking the application of the right to exemption from value added tax on intra-Community supplies.
(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of control of intra-Community value added tax, with a particular focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the above-mentioned regulations.
The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.
System of exchange of information on value added tax The auditing operation was carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as the BRH) in cooperation with each other on the basis of a contract concluded between the two auditing institutions on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected business transactions between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as the German Federal Republic), the use of information obtained through international cooperation between tax administrations and the comparison of the VAT administration systems of both countries.
The joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with the European Directive No. 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1.5.2004 to 31.12.2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
Parallel control in the area of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAIs.
Beyond the main point - the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 - the audit covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements, which are closely linked to the main point.
In addition, the audit included the legal situation in the area of international passenger bus transport and a comparison of some statistical data.
A comparison of the VAT administration systems of the two countries revealed differences in the following areas:
1) VAT registration.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, payers are assigned only one tax identification number, which they also use in intra-community transactions.
In Germany, taxpayers are assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.
If a German payer intends to carry out intra-community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As different forms of registration cause problems, the playing field should be levelled across the EU (see 4.1).
2) International passenger bus transport.
In the Czech Republic, international passenger bus transport is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT (see 4.2).
3) VAT returns.
While in the Czech Republic taxpayers file VAT returns only for individual tax periods (months or quarters), in Germany taxpayers are obliged to file so-called preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year they have to file an annual VAT return.
Unlike the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary tax returns electronically.
The introduction of an obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
(4) Summary reports.
While in the Czech Republic payers file summary reports at financial offices, in Germany payers file summary reports at the Customs Office.
The data from the recapitulative statements are therefore available to the tax authorities in the Czech Republic immediately after their submission.
The information from the recapitulative statements is only available to the German tax authorities after they have been processed into the CLO.
Combating VAT fraud requires up-to-date information on intra-community transactions to be available as soon as possible.
Monthly recapitulative reporting would shorten the time lag between the transaction date and the update of VIES data.
This would in turn allow a timely verification of the taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4).
However, this would require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for the submission of the recapitulative statement.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
The Czech Customs Office monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for information requests received.
The German CLO does not follow the elapsed time.
As a result, the German tax authorities dealt with a significantly lower percentage of applications received within the prescribed period.
Because of these problems, the BRH recommended that the German CLO carry out a continuous alert (see 4.6).
(6) Risk management system.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS), which has both strengths and weaknesses.
The SAO and the SAO warned that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
As part of the cooperation, both SAIs examined selected cases of intra-community transactions carried out between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.
Together, 31 cases of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their completion or suspicions of VAT evasion were examined using the Customs legislation.
It was found that:
In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained through international cooperation to assess the VAT liability of the payers.
In these cases, the payers either improperly claimed the VAT exemption of the supply or failed to declare the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return.
In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in both Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to a request for information.
Cases have been identified where payers have erroneously reported commercial transactions in recapitulative statements.
As a result, the data in the VIES were incorrect and the tax administrations had to check these cases (see 6.).
Progress of control action
Progress of the audit operation in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by the State Budget Revenue Department and the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited bodies were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter referred to as “MF”) and 10 financial offices – the Financial Office in Humpolec, the Financial Office in Jihlava, the Financial Office in Kadani, the Financial Office in Liberec, the Financial Office in Nymburk, the Financial Office in Otrokovice, the Financial Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 4, the Financial Office in Sokolov and the Financial Office in Třinec.
The audit conclusion from this auditing operation was approved by the SAO College on 23 April 2007.
Progress of the auditing operation in Germany
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the Indirect Taxation Control Group and the staff of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
The audit was part of the 2006 audit plan and was therefore notified to the Federal Ministry of Finance in 2006.
After the testing phase, the inspection started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by BRH and later selected by the SAO, BRH had to notify the audit to a number of federal states.
In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance and the CLO, the audit was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
The tax files of the following tax authorities were included:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FÚ for corporations/legal entities (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Central (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-North (Hamburg-Nord) and Hamburg for large enterprises (Hamburg für Großund-Berlin, Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn (Frankfurt-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Bonn-Kössssssssssssssssss
In addition, negotiations took place with the Tax Office of Augsburg-City (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-Old Town (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
A report on the audit findings was submitted to the MoF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two audit institutions
Several meetings between representatives of the two audit institutions took place in the run-up to the parallel audits.
Participants in these meetings became acquainted with the organisation of tax administrations, the legislation on VAT issues and the VAT administration system in both countries.
The topics of the test phase were agreed at a meeting held in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at another joint meeting in August 2006.
In the framework of this meeting, a timetable for the further progress of the work was agreed and the following issues of parallel controls were identified:
1. Registration of payers for VAT.
2.
International passenger bus transport - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of tax administrators when processing requests for information and examining selected problem cases mentioned in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. VAT returns.
5.
Summary reports.
6.
Statistical data on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. VAT risk management.
At the joint auditing day of the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, both parties acquainted themselves with the audit process in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel audits to date.
The report on the results of the parallel controls of VAT administration between the Czech Republic and Germany was prepared at a working meeting in July 2007.
4. Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and Germany
Registration of payers in the Czech Republic
A) Payees who have their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic
According to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees (hereinafter "Act No. 337/1992 Coll."), a taxpayer, a taxpayer and the legal successor of a natural or legal person defined by law as a tax entity shall be considered a tax entity.
As of 31 December 2004, a total of 421 865 tax subjects were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.
As of 1 December 2005, the number of tax entities registered for VAT increased to 457 590.
A taxable person who has his registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic and whose turnover exceeds the amount of CZK 1 000 000 (EUR 33 575) for the next 12 consecutive calendar months shall become a taxable person from the 1st day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (Article 94(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”).
Applications for registration must be submitted by that person within 15 days of the end of the month in which he/she exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not allow a taxable person to be registered so-called retrospectively in cases where the reason for registration is to exceed the legal registration limit.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to deduct may become a taxable person even if he does not exceed the turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) if he fulfils any of the other conditions specified in Act No.235/2004 Coll.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions laid down by law may apply for VAT registration voluntarily.
Delivery of the application for registration to the locally competent tax administrator initiates the registration procedure according to Act No. 337/1992 Coll.
The voluntary VAT payer shall also indicate on the VAT registration form the date from which he applies for registration as a VAT payer.
The tax administrator will check the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed registration application with all annexes.
If it has doubts about the data, it shall invite the taxpayer to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.
After verifying that the taxpayer fulfils the conditions for registration, the tax administrator issues a decision in the form of a certificate that the taxpayer is registered and has been assigned a tax identification number (TIN).
The tax administrator shall indicate on the certificate the date of effect of the VAT registration and the frequency of the VAT tax period.
The tax period is the calendar quarter if the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year did not reach CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).
If the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the tax period is the calendar month.
A payer whose turnover for the previous calendar year amounted to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax period and shall notify the tax administrator of this change.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The allocation of the TIN in the registration certificate is always constitutive and the taxpayer is obliged to state it in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases where a special law so provides (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).
The TIN contains the code ‘CZ’ and a tribal part consisting of a generic identifier.
The general identifier for a natural person is a birth number, or another general identifier if a special law so provides, and for a legal person an identification number (Article 33(12) of Act No 337/1992 Coll.).
If a taxpayer has not fulfilled its registration obligation even at the request of the tax administrator, the local tax administrator shall register it ex officio without delay.
The result of the registration procedure is the issuance of an ex officio Registration Certificate, which is delivered to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, a tax entity that has obtained a business license is allocated a tax exempt number at the moment of its first registration for any tax.
The same VAT number is used by the taxpayer even if it is registered as a VAT payer.
According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., which is effective from 1 January 2005, the tax administrator may, in the event of failure to comply with the VAT registration obligation, impose on the taxable person compensation of up to 10% of the total income or income for taxable transactions that this person has carried out without tax, for the period from the date on which he should have been a registered taxpayer by law to the date on which he became a registered taxpayer by decision of the tax administrator (provisions of Section 98, paragraph 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
The payment of the amount thus determined is considered a tax payment (Section 98(3) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.
The cancellation of the VAT payer's registration when the statutory conditions are fulfilled is possible for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of registration at the request of the payer, mainly due to the amount of turnover that does not reach the registration limit (Section 106(1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
The payer shall be entitled to apply for the deregistration at the earliest after 1 year from the effective date stated on the registration certificate.
2) Cancellation of registration "ex officio" (Section 106(7) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), if: a) the payer has not performed a transaction for 12 consecutive months without notice to the tax administrator, b) the payer has not fulfilled his obligations under Act No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.
B) Taxpayers who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State who does not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who carries out a transaction with a place of performance in the Czech Republic and is a person obliged to declare and pay tax on this transaction pursuant to § 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (the so-called "non-established payer"), becomes a payer on the day of performance of the transaction.
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration to the Tax Office for Prague 1 no later than the date of performance.
The application for registration must mention all the TIN allocated to it in other Member States or in a third country.
If a "non-established" payer submits an application for registration later than the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic, the Financial Office for Prague 1 will register it retroactively, because according to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the taxpayer became a VAT payer on the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic.
In the case of retroactive registration, the Tax Office for Prague 1 requires from tax entities proof that the transaction has been performed (invoices or explanatory letters).
If a "non-established" taxpayer applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable transaction takes place, then the Financial Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts that the transaction will take place.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 “non-established” payers were registered at the Tax Office for Prague 1, including 124 payers from Germany, and as of 31 December 2005, 951 “non-established” payers were registered, including 233 payers from Germany.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 106(9) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of a “non-established” payer on 31 January of the following calendar year if no obligation to declare and pay the tax arose during the current calendar year.
The SAO's audit revealed that if a "non-established" payer submits a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the statutory regulations at the time of filing the tax return, the tax office often does not have it available on 31 January.
In cases where the facts relevant to the possibility of cancelling the registration are known to the tax office later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to cancel the VAT registration of the "non-established" payer in the Czech Republic in a given calendar year.
Registration of payers in Germany
Due to the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (Sections 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter ‘AO’), anyone carrying on a business is required to inform the municipal/municipal authority or the competent tax authority.
The deadline for submission of information is one month after the start of the business.
This information is processed by the Municipal/Municipal Office for the Financial Office.
If the tax office identifies an enterprise that has started but has not registered, the relevant tax office may register the payer ex officio – and retroactively.
Taxpayers who are both tax residents and non-residents in Germany are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria laid down in Paragraph 2 of the German Law on VAT (the UStG).
That obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover which they generate.
There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.
There are special tax offices for entrepreneurs residing abroad.
For example, for those who have their registered office in the Czech Republic, the relevant Tax Office is Chemnitz-Süd.
As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office; As of 1 March 2006, a total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.
BRH found that these special tax offices often refused to register so-called semi-dependent independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.
As the work permits of employees from the ten new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers have tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.
Those undertakings do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs laid down in Paragraph 2 of the UStG, since they are usually dependent on a single employer to determine their working hours and the way in which they carry out their work.
In order to register, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the relevant tax office, in which he must provide information about the company and the activities it carries out.
The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding for all tax offices in Germany.
It is processed either by special departments of the tax authorities or by departments with a general focus, which are responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.
This form is used to carry out a risk assessment of individual taxpayers before the tax office issues a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows certain rules:
The first three digits provide information on the relevant tax office, the next three (or four) provide information on the relevant department at the tax office, the next five (or four) are to distinguish the payers, the last being always the check-digit.
If an entrepreneur intends to engage in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive an exempt intra-Community supply.
The Customs Office shall assign a VAT ID at the request of the trader if the trader is registered in Germany and has a VAT number.
The Customs Office will automatically assign VAT IDs to businesses when the payers include intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns.
The VAT ID structure is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur may be revoked: 1. at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business activity), after all administrative work has been carried out (assessment for all marketing years) and 2. if the tax administration realises that he is no longer engaged in business activity.
The validity of the VAT identification number is normally linked to the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the tax authorities are obliged to inform the Customs Office of the cancellation of the tax number so that the Customs Office can terminate the validity of the VAT identification number.
Under the German VAT Act (Paragraph 19(1) of the UStG), tax residents in Germany are not liable to pay VAT in the event of (1) that the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and (2) that it is unlikely to exceed EUR 50 000 in the following year.
So-called small entrepreneurs (‘Kleinunternehmer’) are not entitled to invoice VAT to other entrepreneurs and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
Although they are not liable to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and must submit an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur may declare that he will not apply Paragraph 19(1) of the UStG.
That declaration shall be binding on him for the following five years.
The trader can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.
For non-residents, there is the possibility of appointing tax representatives (Paragraph 22a of the UStG).
It is a prerequisite that they carry out only exempt commercial transactions and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
The function of a tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign entrepreneur, who does not have to register for VAT.
Invoices must include information on representation for tax purposes.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.
If a tax entity in the Czech Republic does not exceed the specified limit, it has the possibility to apply for VAT registration voluntarily.
The registration process is standardized in Germany, but differences may occur as a result of different organizational models in federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer is assigned a VAT number at the moment of his first registration for any tax.
In case the payer registers for VAT, he uses the same VAT number also in intra-community transactions.
In Germany, the tax number is assigned to the payer when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.
If a German payer intends to carry out intra-community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As the SAO and the SAO found, the German two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration for intra-community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax office about their business.
This retroactive registration allows for a correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax period, in particular a precise estimate of VAT liability.
As different ways of registering cause problems, the playing field should be levelled across the EU.
The German Parliament has recently decided to introduce a Tax Identification Number (TIN).
The Federal Tax Office will assign the TIN at the birth of a natural person.
This TIN will be valid for the entire life of a natural person who is a German resident.
If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax office will apply for an economic VAT number, which will be used as a VAT ID.
In the future, there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the allocation of the VAT ID.
Work on the implementation of the IT resource to manage the TIN has not yet been completed.
International passenger bus transport
Legislation in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., with effect from 1 May 2004, the transport of persons between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct tax.
That transport is exempt from VAT even if it is carried out by traders who are registered for tax in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.
The return journey shall be considered as a separate journey.
If "non-established" tax subjects in the Czech Republic do not carry out other economic activities besides international bus transport of persons, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.
International passenger transport in the Czech Republic was exempt from VAT on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5, paragraph 1, letter b), where it is stated:
‘For the purposes of Article 28(3)(b), the following shall be added: Pursuant to Article 2(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may continue to exempt from value added tax international passenger transport under point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Article 28(4) of the Directive is fulfilled or until the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier. “
Description of legislation in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in Article 3b(1) of the German VAT Act, the place of supply of passenger transport (i.e. transport services) is the route (i.e. the place) where the transport takes place.
The German tax system therefore makes no distinction between national and international cross-border passenger transport.
Only that part of the route which takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable supply of transport in Germany.
The German tax system also makes no distinction between residents and non-residents.
If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers via Germany, the part of the route that takes place in Germany also constitutes a taxable supply of transport.
A non-resident taxpayer must declare his intention to provide passenger transport to the relevant tax office before performing his services in Germany.
The tax office registers this non-resident for tax purposes (cf. 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach mentioned in the taxpayer's notification.
The taxpayer is obliged to declare his taxable supplies of transport in the German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office registered 741 Czech payers operating in the passenger transport sector.
If the passenger transport is provided to a resident taxpayer who is liable for VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the tax office.
Instead, the entity liable to pay the VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer is the resident taxpayer who receives the services; This process is known as reverse charge and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to the notification of the non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return, the German tax authorities have several means of assessing the correctness of the taxable supplies of passenger transport declared.
The Customs office's mobile inspection teams audit the certificates of buses licensed for foreign transport, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each audit, the mobile control groups send a control report to the relevant tax authority.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to require the bus driver to pay VAT before proceeding with the next transport.
A non-resident taxpayer may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax calculated in his VAT return.
If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may declare its intention to carry out an audit, which must take place in the office of the tax office, or it may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).
Even if a non-resident taxpayer refuses to pay the amount of VAT charged in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may request administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
If the VAT return or the non-resident taxpayer’s obligations are to be examined, BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too labour-intensive compared with the small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable passenger transport services.
In particular, auditing the accounts of a non-resident taxpayer entails disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.
The tax administration has to audit foreign accounting, which means not only the need for foreign language knowledge, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.
An audit of this type is also likely to require more time than an audit of the tax resident, but this audit is limited to those passenger transport services carried out in Germany.
On the other hand, a non-resident taxpayer may not only accept the right to carry out checks which is the responsibility of his national tax authorities, but also the right to have an audit carried out by other Member States in which he carries passengers.
Moreover, in each Member State in which only one passenger transport service is carried out, the taxpayer is required to comply with all the tax obligations applicable to him in those Member States, in all the languages and on all the tax forms of those Member States.
Real taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore entails disproportionate bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation in the two countries is different.
In the Czech Republic, the transport of persons between individual EU Member States, or between Member States and third countries, is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory constitutes a taxable transaction.
If this transport is provided in Germany for the first time by a non-established payer, he is obliged to notify the relevant tax office in advance.
The tax office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to declare taxable supplies of part of the transport in the tax return in Germany.
The implementation of the law is very time-consuming in Germany.
At least three out of four Czech payers registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office are in the passenger transport business.
Compared to the effort, tax revenue, if realised, is rather low.
Member States collecting VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT are subject to time-consuming obligations without a financially sensitive outcome.
In order to avoid disproportionate costs for charging VAT, the supply of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in only one Member State.
This could be the country where the transport begins or where the provider is based.
Such taxation would require an adaptation of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
VAT returns
Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
The payer is obliged to submit a VAT return using the form prescribed by the MoF within 25 days after the end of the tax period, even if he has not become liable to tax, unless the law provides otherwise.
The actual tax liability is due within the deadline for filing the VAT return, with the exception of the tax charged in connection with the importation of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., for which the tax due is determined by customs regulations.
If a repayable excess arises as a result of the assessment of the excess deduction, it shall be returned to the payer without request within 30 days of the assessment of the excess deduction.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax administrator initiates tax proceedings concerning the taxpayer's tax liability.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 73(11) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct may be exercised in a regular VAT return at the latest for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct could be exercised.
After the expiry of that period, the right to deduct may continue to be exercised within 3 years of the end of the tax year in which the right to deduct could have been exercised at the earliest.
However, this is only possible by submitting a supplementary VAT return.
The amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period when the right to deduct could be exercised for the first time.
The payer is obliged to submit a supplementary VAT return if (a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, (b) he makes a correction in which the last known tax liability does not change, but only the data previously claimed by the taxpayer, (c) he makes a correction of the tax rate and amount pursuant to Section 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
The payer may submit a supplementary VAT return if the aggregated corrections reduce the tax liability.
The additional VAT return must be submitted by the payer by the end of the month following the discovery of these facts.
The submission of VAT returns in electronic form can be done either via the Internet or on a technical data medium.
Internet submissions may be made as a submission with a data message bearing an advanced electronic signature or as a submission with a data message not bearing an advanced electronic signature.
In the case of submission with a data message without a guaranteed electronic signature, submission in written form is still required, i.e. delivery of the computer report to the tax administrator (e-form).
The VAT return contains separate lines concerning the values of intra-Community supplies/acquisitions of goods.
The values of acquisitions of services are shown on specific lines of the VAT return.
Some lines are used for the purpose of the initial automated control within the ADIS system.
The values of supplies of goods to other Member States to persons registered for tax in other Member States shall be compared with the data provided in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers.
The values of acquisitions of goods from other Member States from taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with those obtained through the VIES system from the recapitulative statements of payers from other EU Member States.
A credibility test of VAT returns is carried out at the tax office under the ADIS system.
This test is automatic, as VAT returns cannot be assessed without a test.
The credibility test involves calculating the credibility criteria and evaluating the risk types of VAT returns.
Under Section 37(1) of Act No 337/1992, the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who fails to comply with a non-monetary obligation arising from this or a special tax law or imposed by a decision pursuant to this Act within a specified period of time.
Automated tax information system used by the FA for technical support of tax administration.
The SAO audit found that the tax authorities did not usually use the option to impose a fine on the payers for not filing VAT returns.
Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, we distinguish between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are required to submit preliminary VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not liable for VAT are required to submit an annual tax return.
As a general rule, taxpayers are required to submit a quarterly VAT return by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT is incurred (Paragraph 18(2) of the UStG).
However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6 136 in the previous calendar year, or if the business is a newly established business, the trader concerned is required to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day of the following month.
The taxpayer may also decide to file a monthly VAT return if a refund of more than EUR 6 136 was made last year (Paragraph 18(2a) of the UStG).
VAT returns do not have to be submitted if the amount of annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.
The relevant VAT liability must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax year in which the VAT accrued.
The refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FC.
There are no (statutory) time limits for processing tax returns and refunding excess VAT.
In order to obtain a timely refund, a security may be offered for the amount to be refunded.
The basic principle is to process VAT returns and return the tax quickly.
The German VAT Code provides for the possibility of extending that period (Paragraph 18(6) of the UStG).
Such an extension must be requested separately.
It allows the submission of a VAT return and the payment of the corresponding VAT liability one month later, provided that a special advance is paid in the case of a monthly return.
This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT liability.
Whenever an error is detected, the trader must submit a corrective VAT return.
There is no additional VAT return.
Once the annual VAT return, which must be submitted by 31 May of the following calendar year, has been registered with the tax office, the trader cannot correct the incorrect provisional VAT return, but only the annual VAT return.
The correction of the annual VAT return for or against the payer shall be possible during the following 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.
After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally only be corrected in cases of tax fraud or evasion.
Taxpayers are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns electronically.
The tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT return can be submitted on paper or via the Internet, with or without certification.
If it is carried out without certification, the payer must submit the return once more on paper with personal signatures.
If the payer fails to file a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.
In case of late submission, a penalty payment (maximum 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000) may be imposed on the payer.
During a previous inspection, BRH found that the tax authorities often do not calculate this standard penalty.
In other cases where the tax authorities have imposed a fine, the amount has been assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The standard fine therefore fails to meet its objective of reducing the average delay, in particular when submitting the annual VAT return.
The VAT return contains separate lines relating to the values of intra-Community supplies/acquisitions of goods.
The values of acquisitions of services are shown on specific lines of the VAT return.
Non-taxable transactions must be reported on a separate VAT return line.
In the case of VAT returns which are submitted in paper form, a copy must be made either by scanner or by staff specifically authorised to do so.
Data from VAT returns submitted electronically are immediately available to the tax office employee.
Once all the data are fed into the system, RMS staff will go through them and select cases that meet certain criteria.
The VAT returns collected must be checked by a tax office employee on the basis of a control report prepared by the system.
(see section 5.2).
Although the tax administration has to make a rough estimate of the amount of VAT the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers file VAT returns within 25 days after the end of the tax period.
The tax period is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month, depending on the amount of the payer's turnover.
In Germany, taxpayers submit preliminary VAT returns, depending on their tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days after the end of a calendar quarter or a month.
By 31 May of the following year, taxpayers are required to file an annual tax return.
The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has its pros and cons:
+ at the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in the (monthly preliminary) tax returns by submitting a single annual VAT return;
– if the payer corrects the declared intra-community transactions, the correction cannot be related to the period for which the recapitulative statement is made;
– the Länder do not normally compare VIES data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers before the annual VAT return is processed.
In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3), German taxpayers are required to file an annual VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This obligation enables the German tax authority to verify the maximum turnover limit for small businesses.
In addition, the responsible tax office is able to compare the annual VAT returns with the direct tax returns and the final accounts.
In the Czech Republic, tax administrators are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only from filed income tax returns.
Unlike the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit VAT returns in electronic form.
The introduction of an obligation to submit tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary reports
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
The recapitulative statement (hereinafter referred to as “SH”) is submitted pursuant to the provisions of § 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. by a payer who has made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State.
Data on the value of supplied goods are always presented in Czech currency, broken down by individual tax entities with their VAT ID, under which they are registered in their country.
Data on services provided shall not be included in the SH.
SH is filed by taxpayers with both monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days after the end of the period to the locally competent tax office.
Correction of erroneous data shall be performed in the subsequent SH within 15 days from the date of detection of errors.
The incorrect data in the SH shall always be replaced by the data in the subsequent SH.
As well as tax returns, payers can submit SH in electronic form.
In the event that the payer does not file the SH or subsequent SH and should have filed it under Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator will invite him to file it and at the same time inform him of the consequences in the event of failure to file the SH or subsequent SH, i.e. that the tax administrator is entitled under Section 37 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll. to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) for non-monetary obligations.
The SAO audit found that the tax authorities did not usually use the possibility to impose a fine on payers for non-compliance with their legal obligations.
In particular, in the case of filing the SH, there is insufficient incentive for tax subjects to fulfil their obligations, as the non-filing of the SH does not affect VAT liability.
The tax administrator is obliged according to § 102 paragraph 5 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. to check the data in the SH, or in the subsequent SH, to remove any ambiguities and to use the data for the determination of tax liability.
In case of inconsistency of the data in the SH and the data in the relevant (the payer with the monthly tax period) or the relevant (the payer with the quarterly tax period) VAT return, the tax administrator should verify the correctness of the declared tax obligation stated in the VAT return.
Incorrect data in the SH shall be corrected by the taxpayer himself or he may be required to do so by filing a subsequent SH.
The tax administrator will correct the data on the supply of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:
– the payer does not prove the data specified in the SH (or subsequent SH) and corrects them by filing a subsequent SH,
– the tax administrator proved that the data given by the payer in the SH or subsequent SH are not true.
By inserting a correction without submission of the subsequent SH by the payer, the tax administrator does not replace the submission of the tax entity, only modifies the data in the VIES database so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
SH data shall be sent to the Member States concerned.
They can only be sent and received by a national financial administration authority designated for cooperation with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is fulfilled by the Ministry of Finance, Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration (CLO).
O_MCTL is an automatic message received by the CLO from other Member States.
Contains all incorrect VAT IDs listed in the SH lines sent.
If the wrong VAT ID is used in one of the transferred normal lines of SH or subsequent SH, a record is made in the wrong VAT ID table.
The table contains the so-called "Notice of Doubt on VAT ID".
The tax administrator checks the data and records the result of the verification in the system.
When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is obliged to declare the VAT and indicate the values of the acquisition on separate lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of irregularities in the value of the acquired goods declared by the Czech payer in his VAT return and in the value of the supplied goods as stated by the payers from other Member States in their SH are sent from Customs to the tax office for verification.
Tax authorities are obliged to investigate irregularities.
Three situations can arise:
a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant VAT return lines is lower than the value of the supply declared by EU payers.
In this case, the tax administrator checks the accuracy of the data.
b) The difference is 0.
This situation can occur either by changing the data in the EU (the foreign supplier corrects his SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer himself files a supplementary VAT return in the meantime).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax authority whether, despite this fact, it will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.
c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States, as stated by the Czech taxpayer in the relevant VAT return lines, is higher than the value of the delivered goods declared to the EU taxpayer.
Here too, it is at the discretion of the controller to verify the accuracy of the data.
After examining the difference and explaining the causes of its occurrence, the tax administrator enters the result of the verification into the ADIS.
The results of the verification are transmitted back to the CLO.
The numbers of cases sent from the CLO to the tax authorities for verification for each quarter of 2005 are shown in Chart No.1 (NB: MF).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases transmitted from the PRC to the tax authorities decreased for each quarter of 2005.
The number decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2005. The CLO increased the minimum threshold, inter alia with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.
The discrepancy between VAT return data and EU data may not always be due to an error on the part of the domestic payer.
It may also be an error on the part of EU payers or an error due to the fact that certain types of transactions may be reported to the SH in different ways in different EU Member States.
The most common reasons for irregularities in the values of reported transactions found at the audited financial offices are given in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or engage in triangular transactions are required to file a quarterly SH listing intra-Community deliveries by recipients (Section 18a(1) UStG).
The SH must be filed by the 10th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.
If an extension of this deadline is granted in the case of preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to the SH.
SH must be supplied to the CLO.
They must be submitted electronically from 1 January 2007.
Exemptions may be granted by the competent tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.
In cases where taxpayers realise that incorrect information is included in the SH, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.
In the event that taxpayers do not file an SH, the CLO will initiate proceedings to enforce the submission of such a report.
This procedure includes: – a first reminder; – a second reminder with the threat of a fine/periodic penalty payment; and – the imposition of a periodic penalty payment.
Although the German Tax Code allows fines of up to EUR 25 000 to be imposed (section 329 AO), the Customs Authority determines the fines in three steps, in amounts of EUR 125, 250 and 500.
In addition, Paragraph 26a(1) No 5 of the UStG provides that payers act unlawfully if, intentionally or negligently, they fail to properly file the SH, file it incomplete, do not file it in time or if they fail to correct or correct the SH at all.
This offence can be punished by a fine of up to EUR 5 000.
Data on intra-community deliveries cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office, as the processing of SH is the sole task of the CLO.
SH data are only stored in the CLO system.
Therefore, the data from the SH are only visually available to the tax office after they have been processed into the CLO.
The deadlines for processing SH are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
SH data must be stored during the three months following the calendar quarter in question.
Where incorrect VAT IDs are entered in the SH of German payers, the CLO receives the O_MCTL codes from another Member State.
The CLO contacts a particular entrepreneur and asks for the correct information.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case is referred to the competent tax authorities.
It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct data.
During the inspection, the BRH found that most traders had corrected the VAT ID at the request of the Customs Office.
However, the challenge, the threat and the imposition of three additional fines take up too much time in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
These cases, which were eventually reported to the competent tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.
The tax office refused to exempt declared intra-community supplies in 73% of these cases.
When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the tax office asked him to file a corrected VAT ID with the Customs office, as the tax authorities cannot correct the VIES data themselves.
BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor the CLO checked the submission of the corrected SH, so the payers often did not comply with the request.
In view of the fact that the Customs Office does not have access to the VAT return data, the comparison of the data on the supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in the SH will not take place before the submission of these data to the Customs of the other Member States.
This control can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually applied when preparing the VAT control.
Data obtained from other Member States are processed into a CLO.
Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and then submitted to the relevant Member States.
These data are used for the purpose of control of acquisition by the tax authorities.
Once they are entered into the system, they are checked by the CLO on the basis of a comparison with data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control information is generated and sent to the relevant tax authorities.
This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is produced at a later stage and submitted to the tax authorities.
The RMS installed for the assessment procedure shall subsequently check these data against intra-Community data.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State shall submit SH within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to the locally competent tax office.
The tax authorities process the SH and transmit the data to the CLO.
The values of the supplies of goods to another Member State, indicated by the payers in the SH, are compared at the tax offices with the values of the supplies of goods to another Member State, indicated by these payers in their VAT returns.
The results of the comparison are used in the assessment procedure.
In Germany, payers who have made an intra-community delivery are obliged to submit a quarterly SH by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.
SH payers submit to the CLO, since 1 January 2007 in electronic form.
The information from the SH is only available to the tax authorities after it has been processed into the CLO.
Taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany list only the supply of goods in the SH, the provision of services is not mentioned in the SH.
Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are not able to correct the incorrect lines submitted by SH on their own.
As a result of this limited access to the German VIES data, the incorrect VAT ID was not corrected even if the payer provided the correct VAT ID to the FÚ.
The German tax administration does not compare the data on intra-Community supplies contained in the VAT return of the German taxpayer with his SH.
Differences between the data of these two statements are usually not detected before the German CLO provides the VIES data to other Member States.
In view of the BRH findings, it is clear that a comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in the VIES.
Data on the delivery of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their VAT returns.
The comparison shall be carried out by the CLO separately for each calendar quarter.
The most significant cases of irregularities are transmitted to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in the tax returns of the payers.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intra-community acquisitions.
Such a general check is processed only for payers who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other payers only if the RMS produces a control notice or if the payer is designated for inspection anyway.
This procedure relieves the tax authorities of the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of RMS.
Combating carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intra-community acquisitions as soon as possible.
The current SH system, specifically VIES, provides financial authorities with information that can be up to six months old.
This delay can be reduced by up to four months if payers submit a monthly SH.
Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, because most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to file monthly VAT returns – and SH does not require any additional information compared to the tax return.
In order to avoid bureaucratic costs, the filing of the SH may be combined with the filing of a VAT return.
However, the obligation to administer the SH monthly would cause more temporal discrepancies between the reporting of intra-community delivery and intra-community acquisition and could increase the flow of data between the different CLOs.
In 2006, the German Federal Government considered a general provision for monthly SHs.
Its implementation has failed due to doubts of the federal states.
They feared that the monthly submission of VIES data to other Member States' CLOs could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact, if the monthly SH and monthly data reporting obligations were to be effective, the monthly VIES update would require a European monthly SH standard.
Statistical data on delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany
In terms of foreign trade, Germany is the most important trading partner for the Czech Republic.
The total volumes of intra-community transactions in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Table 2.
Both SAIs requested data on the number of incorrect VAT numbers or VAT IDs contained in O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The figures show substantial differences.
These differences may be due to different bases for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was filed, the German CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
International Information Exchange Level 3
Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax administrations to obtain information from other Member States regarding intra-Community commercial transactions and the payers who carried out those transactions.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 distinguishes between two basic categories of exchange of information, namely exchange of information upon request and exchange of information without prior request.
The international exchange of information on request takes the form of so-called requests for information (hereinafter referred to as "GIs"), using standardised SCAC forms.
Tax administrators from the Czech Republic send their GI, or replies to the received GI, through the Financial Directorate to the Customs Office, which ensures the translation of the information provided on the standardized SCAC forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.
The Customs Office also ensures the receipt of GIs from other Member States and the replies to the dispatched GIs, their translation into Czech and their distribution to the locally competent tax authorities for processing.
Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 provides for a maximum time limit of 3 months from receipt of the request for the discharge of the EIT.
The SAO audited all SAIs submitted between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period.
Out of the total number of 94 GIs received from Germany in the Czech Republic, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month deadline, another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this deadline and the remaining 1 case was not sent a response to Germany by the time of the SAO audit.
Graph 2 provides more detailed information on the deadlines by which replies to RUs received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic.
Out of the total number of 335 GIs sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month deadline, another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) received a reply after this deadline and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) did not receive a reply from Germany by the time of the SAO audit (in the remaining 1 case it was not possible to determine when the response from Germany was received).
Chart 3 provides more detailed information on the deadlines by which replies to the RUs sent to Germany were received in the Czech Republic.
Graph 4 contains the percentage of intra-community transaction values reported in the RU transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.
As can be seen from the graph above, the value of the commercial transactions examined through the GI was most often in the range above EUR 60 000.
International exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic or structured automatic exchange of information or in the form of spontaneous exchange of information.
Tax administrations from other Member States are often provided, without prior request, with information that may be of interest to them in managing VAT.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The information shall be transmitted electronically between Member States.
Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, ‘automatic exchange’ means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States without prior request and at predetermined regular intervals.
‘Structured automatic exchange’ means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as the information is available.
The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.
This information is available to the tax administrator from the form of the Delivery of a new means of transport pursuant to § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.
When processing the aforementioned form, the tax administrator fills in the necessary data in a specially created template and transmits it in turn to the contact person at the financial directorate where the data are collected and within the stipulated deadline, i.e. no later than two months from the end of the quarter in which the information was available, transmitted to the Customs Office for subsequent processing and transmission to other Member States.
In addition, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on mail order sales exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU transactions that appear to be unauthorised and information on potential "missing traders".
This information is sent to other Member States by spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the local tax office.
The tax authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The tax authorities have been instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.
Half of the German requests for information checked by BRH were sent in order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in another Member State or to prove the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State.
If the German customs authority receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall check the value of the supplies of goods or services specified in the request for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.
If there are no reasonable grounds for such a request, the German CLO shall reject any request containing an amount lower than the limit.
In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are not in German or English.
In order to respond to a request for information, the CLO sends the request to the relevant tax office, referring to the three-month period.
There are no further deadlines for processing applications at specific organisational levels of the tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor past deadlines, it lacks sufficient staffing capacity to draw the attention of the tax authorities to replies to blank requests for information.
The tax authorities obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.
Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit covering any taxable process over a period of several months, or a so-called VAT inspection, which can only cover one recent transaction.
This short and ﬂexible type of audit requires no notification to the taxpayer and has proven its usefulness in investigating individual taxable transactions.
Under the automatic exchange without prior request, the FRG provides information to other Member States: – on the VAT IDs allocated to taxpayers resident in other Member States, – on the refund of input tax to taxpayers resident in other Member States.
In addition, the FRG has undertaken to provide the following information to other Member States through structured automatic exchange:
a. Supply of new means of transport to businesses without the use of their VAT ID, b. dispatching or catalogue sales in other Member States which are not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intra-Community acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d. intra-Community supply of goods which the German payer did not declare in the SH because it treated the supplies as domestic transactions, e. potential "trader" who carried out intra-Community transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID, f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential "missing traders" or misused their VAT ID.
Comparison and evaluation
The dispatch of the RU or spontaneous information is initiated both in the Czech Republic and in Germany by the locally competent tax authorities, which send the completed SCAC form to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses the bilingual SCAC form (Czech – English) and translates the information sent into English or German, the German tax authorities follow the instruction that they should write the ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German using the monolingual form.
The German CLO does not provide translation of German texts.
The SAO found that 74.5 % of the submitted applications were processed by the Czech Tax Administration within the three-month period, while only 40.6 % of the cases were processed by the German Tax Administration in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Although the German CLO alerts the tax authorities to the three-month deadline, it does not monitor the time limits that have elapsed.
The result of missing notifications is a large number of delayed replies to the ZOI.
Because of these problems, the BRH recommended regular warnings to the CLO.
The situation has already improved.
According to the latest information, the German CLO is now alerting the tax authorities to reply to the unfinished replies to the RUI.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several departments at different organisational levels of the tax administration deal with VAT risk management.
Within the MF, the following departments deal with the issue of risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
VAT Methodology and Performance Department and within it a report Risk management in the field of VAT, which, among other things, manages the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates the trends of these risks at domestic and Community level.
It coordinates the functioning of the role nationwide. The credibility of VAT returns and the use of VIES data in terms of the risks of tax evasion in intra-community transactions.
On the basis of trade balance data, the Czech Republic evaluates risky commodities, prepares conceptual risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates in this area with relevant EU institutions and other Member States.
The International Cooperation Unit for VAT Administration, which inter alia provides information exchange in the field of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, provides information to the public and provides other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Both SAIs requested data on the number of incorrect VAT numbers or VAT IDs contained in O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The figures show substantial differences.
These differences may be due to different bases for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was filed, the German CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
The Tax Control and Search Methodology Unit, which, among other things, carries out risk analysis in the framework of the methodological management of tax controls and, in accordance with risk analysis, prioritises the targeting of tax controls in the plans of the Financial Directorates, carries out risk analyses in the framework of the reduction of tax evasion, including the collection of lessons learned from the tax administration and from other sources, and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.
Search units are set up in the financial directorates, which carry out, among other things, searches of tax entities and areas that are at risk from the incidence of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searches of unregistered tax entities from the point of view of the risk of tax evasion (e.g. from internet services, job placement, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of links of chain fraud and transmission of information to local tax authorities.
Specialised control units are set up in the 12 tax offices selected.
They have regional competence and carry out tax inspections outside the territorial competence of the tax authorities on the basis of a mandate.
The need to set up a specialised tax inspection unit has arisen on the basis of increasing findings of new and improved forms of tax evasion, mainly involving entities linked to chains.
These units focus on the control of tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with a specific activity and multinational companies and tax entities with a large scale of activity in terms of turnover.
The following mechanisms have been integrated into the ADIS system to limit VAT risks: – the role of Trust in VAT returns, to evaluate the risk of tax returns submitted; – the role of Selection of tax entities for control, to allow for the selection of payers for control on the basis of the chosen criteria; – the role of VIES, through which tax administrations have access to data provided from other EU Member States.
The role of VIES allows, among other things: – to verify the validity of VAT IDs of payers from other Member States; – to obtain from other Member States the values of goods delivered to the Czech payer declared in the SH by all his suppliers from other Member States; – to generate a report of payers who have not filed the SH; – to carry out a formal check of the data provided by payers from the Czech Republic in the SH before sending these data to other Member States; – to generate a report of payers for whom the data on the delivery of goods to other Member States listed in the VAT returns do not match the data of all other Member States.
As part of their activities to reduce the risk of tax evasion, tax administrators have access to registers of state administration bodies such as the Commercial Register, the Land Register, the Register of Motor Vehicles, the Register of Business Enterprises, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to the federal structure of Germany, the federal tax administration (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of 16 federal states are involved in the development and operation of the RMS.
Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the federal tax administrations share a fully consistent database.
At the level of the CLO, the ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as KUSS - Coordination Unit for Special VAT Audits and Tax Investigations) collects audit findings concerning tax fraud in a specific database called OPUS.
KUSS, in cooperation with the tax authorities, has set up a new database called ZAUBER, designed to transfer the names of missing traders' companies.
KUSS coordinates related cases of domestic and cross-border tax fraud.
The experience of KUSS is reflected in the development of RMS in working groups.
In addition, the specialists of several other departments of the CLO and MF are entrusted with the duties and powers associated with the RMS.
At the level of the CLO, there is a formal check of the composition of other Member States' VAT IDs in the SH filed by German payers.
This formal check is made prior to the provision of SH data to other Member States, to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).
Validation of VAT IDs listed in SH is done on the basis of O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the procedure to correct an invalid VAT ID, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS on the CLO is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and creates several types of control reports based on several characteristics, which usually figure in so-called carousel trading operations, in order to identify potential "missing traders".
The federal tax authorities are instructed to draw up these audit reports and, in some cases, report the results of their findings to the CLO.
The findings of the BRH audit confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all the available characteristics if a case of tax fraud (instead of focusing solely on the company’s turnover) is to be assumed with a sufficient degree of probability.
The BRH therefore suggested to the IMF that various characteristics should be taken into account in the reporting process.
The RMS should also cover other issues such as the payment behaviour (morale) of the taxpayer, the sector (economic activities) or the shareholder structure.
The second level of the RMS is processed in the federal tax administrations and focuses on the processing of VAT returns.
For example, the RMS generates a list of those payers who have reported intra-community deliveries in their tax returns.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the full submission of SH.
In addition, this type of RMS compares intra-community acquisitions reported in the payer's annual VAT return with VIES data.
The tax administrations of the Länder try to avoid comparing quarterly data because such comparison would reveal too many disapproving data that are attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
– different execution times for the intra-community transaction in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand and the beneficiary on the other;
– different accounting for sales discounts and sales promotions (incentives) and their different presentation in the tax return.
In addition to comparing data from VAT returns and the VIES system, many Länder have introduced elements of the RMS which are based on data from VAT returns and some other elements (such as the structure of the company name, the age of the shareholders, the number of employees and the payment behaviour/morale of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a RMS based on rules that allow a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as risk managers) to programme their own rules for the identification of potential tax evaders.
This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT return.
The competent tax authority will therefore receive the recommendation made by the RMS before the determination of VAT.
As this RMS is unable to reflect current findings in its activities, risk managers need to adjust the relevant rules based on feedback from the tax authorities.
The district of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with data from tax files where a check revealed tax evasion.
On the basis of this data, RMS is able to ascertain the characteristics of the tax evasion.
The RMS establishes once a month a list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.
The relevant tax authorities shall use this list as a basis for deciding on the audit of proposed taxpayers.
Following the audit, auditors must report their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.
The administrative region of North Rhine-Westphalia uses an adaptive artificial neural network, which is combined with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on a large amount of data from the VAT returns under consideration and some other facts, this neural fuzzy or data-mining system calculates the probability that a taxpayer has committed tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of potential fraudsters.
The local tax authorities use this list as a basis for the selection of the relevant taxpayers for inspection and report the findings of the inspection to the data processing centre.
The implementation of one of these three RMS in the other Länder is ongoing.
As none of the three RMS is based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful for tackling tax fraud.
It remains to be seen whether this system will produce the expected results.
Comparison and evaluation
Although the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three federal states of Germany, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.
New trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud are currently being discussed by the tax authorities of the EU Member States.
VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – does not turn out to be a national problem, but rather a European one.
Taxpayers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in several States.
An effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.
A VAT loss due to fraud in the EU may not affect the Member State of the instigator of the fraud.
Any Member State involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.
Therefore, there should be a European exchange and discussion on the RMS.
Selected audit findings when verifying commercial transactions
Within the framework of the cooperation on the implementation of parallel audits, the SAO and BRH examined the quality and use of information on selected business transactions, which were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two audit institutions jointly scrutinized the execution of several commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution, or discrepancies in the way the payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their VAT returns, respectively SH.
At the request of BRH, the SAO examined a total of 8 cases concerning commercial transactions between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.
In addition, in 43 cases, the SAO audited the values of intra-community transactions with Germany reported by Czech payers in their tax returns and SH based on BRH warnings.
At the SAO's request, BRH examined a total of 23 cases involving commercial transactions between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through official communication with the Customs.
Examination of the selected cases revealed, among other things, that the different way of registering in the EU Member States leads to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods worth EUR 60 500 from the German payer in the third quarter of 2004.
As the Czech payer declared the acquisition of goods only in the value corresponding to EUR 29 869, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to verify the value of the supplied goods.
In its reply to the RUI received from Germany, the German side stated that in the second quarter of 2004 the German payer delivered goods to the Czech payer in the value of EUR 27 381, in the third quarter in the value of EUR 31 997 and in the fourth quarter of 2004 in the value of EUR 10 276.
The reply also showed that the VAT ID of the German payer had only been valid since 28 September 2004, but the German Customs in 2006, on the basis of an additional request from the German payer for a VAT ID validity certificate, issued a VAT ID validity certificate retroactively from 1 May 2004.
The German payer corrected the SH.
On the basis of this information, the Czech payer was involved in the acquisition of goods.
The SAO inquired with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic and found that the Czech payer, on the basis of an investigation by the tax administrator, submitted additional VAT returns for individual tax periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States and at the same time exercised the right to deduct VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.
However, it was not possible for the Czech tax authorities to determine unequivocally from those supplementary VAT returns whether the values of the supplies from the abovementioned German supplier were also included.
Based on the SAO’s request, BRH found out that the German supplier had been registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, since he did not apply for a VAT ID when registering, he was only given an identification number for transactions within Germany.
Although in Germany it is usually not possible to assign a VAT ID retroactively to a VAT payer, in this case the German tax official in 2006 assigned a VAT ID retroactively to the aforementioned German VAT payer as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates the VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause a delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay was caused by the CLO after the payer's VAT ID application.
In this case, the VAT ID is allocated retroactively by the Customs Office because the trader does not need his own valid VAT ID for intra-Community supplies pursuant to Section 6 of the German VAT Act.
By contrast, the German beneficiary does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier in order to declare intra-community acquisitions.
Because of these different practices between Member States, the German CLO in this specific case has allocated the VAT ID retroactively.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested verification of the German taxpayer's VAT registration.
The VIES indicated the date of registration as 5.3.2005, while the date of 1.10.2004 was indicated on the German payer’s registration certificate issued by the German tax office responsible for the place.
In the reply received from Germany, the German authorities stated that the German taxpayer had been registered since 1 October 2004, but that the VAT ID had not been provided to him in Germany until 16 February 2005 for organisational reasons.
The SAO inquired with the local tax administrator and found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a VAT audit of the Czech tax payer for the tax period from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
By this audit, the tax office found that the Czech payer included in the VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 (EUR 314) provided to the German payer in the period before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
For the tax period of the third quarter of 2004, the tax office charged the taxpayer VAT amounting to CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).
On the basis of the SAO's request, BRH found out that the German payer was not assigned a VAT ID until 16.2.2005 when it informed the tax office about its business, which it had started in 2004.
In addition, the tax office registered it for VAT retrospectively as of 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.
In this tax return, the payer declared an intra-community acquisition from the Czech Republic worth EUR 160 (about CZK 5,000).
3. The Czech payer declared the delivery of goods worth CZK 114 615 (EUR 3 642) to the German payer in the VAT return for September 2004 and SH for the third quarter of 2004.
During the verification of the registration of the German payer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found that his registration was valid from 11 November 2004, i.e. after the delivery of the goods by the Czech payer to Germany.
The Czech payer filed an additional VAT DAP in which he declared the tax base of the effected transactions in the Czech Republic in the amount of CZK 114 615 (EUR 3 642) and VAT in the amount of CZK 21 777 (EUR 692), which he paid.
The SAO inquired at the local tax office in the Czech Republic and found that the Czech payer subsequently filed a request for a retrial in the matter of the additional VAT declaration and submitted as evidence a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German payer had been taxed since 1 January 2000.
Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the registration of the German payer in the framework of the international exchange of information.
It was apparent from the reply received from Germany that the German taxpayer was not granted a VAT ID until 11.11.2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the application for a retrial.
BRH found that this was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods, as the German payer did not obtain a VAT ID until 11.11.2004.
However, the German recipient declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and declared the VAT on that acquisition by claiming an input tax refund of the same amount.
However, since there would have been no change in the value of the VAT payable by the German taxpayer, the tax authorities in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.
BRH also found that the name of the German taxpayer, mentioned in the GI, had been changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in confusion between two German tax entities.
This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax administrator.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator verified the acquisition of goods by a Czech payer in the first quarter of 2005 in the amount of EUR 22 686 from a German payer.
The SAO inquired with the local tax authority in the Czech Republic and found that the tax authority had carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer, during which it verified that the delivery of the goods had taken place and the Czech payer had accounted for and paid the invoice for the goods in question.
The Czech payer did not declare the acquisition of goods in the VAT return because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number for domestic transactions in Germany.
In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer was registered for VAT for intra-community transactions only from 21 April 2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech payer.
At the same time, the Czech tax administrator asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the German tax payer's registration certificate so that he could take steps to assess the tax if necessary.
The Czech Tax Office assessed the commercial transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-payer in Germany and therefore did not charge the Czech payer additional tax on the commercial transaction.
The BRH found that, under German law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not need to have a VAT ID in order to exempt intra-Community supplies of goods from VAT.
The supplier must only have the VAT ID of the customer from another Member State and be able to prove that the goods have been transported to another Member State.
According to the German VAT Act, this was therefore an intra-community transaction and VAT should be charged in the Czech Republic.
In any event, it is important that the Czech tax authorities noticed this transaction, since the supply of the machine at this value was not the main business of the German supplier.
As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to reply to the EIT relating to intra-Community transactions of less than EUR 15 000: 5.
According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from the German payer in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech tax administrator carried out a tax audit of the tax entity for this tax period.
In the context of international administrative cooperation, he asked the German tax authorities to verify the supply of those goods using the SCAC form.
The Czech payer denied the acquisition of the goods, claiming that he had never traded with the German company and that the acquisition of the goods was not recorded in his accounts.
The German tax administration rejected the request to provide evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – on the grounds that the turnover did not exceed EUR 15 000 and no other explanatory reasons were given.
Since the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence to assess the tax on the acquired goods, he terminated the tax inspection without finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.
Based on the SAO’s request, BRH found that the German payer acted as a so-called “fiscal representative” (Section 22a – e UStG).
The German payer declared these deliveries in his annual VAT return and in the SH.
He was entitled to the exemption of the supply.
On the basis of BRH's notification, the German tax office will send to the Czech Republic the documents necessary for the assessment of the tax on the acquired goods in the Czech Republic.
As stated in chapter 4.6.1, the replies to the RU sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the replies from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.
The SAO audit found that the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany on 5 October 2005 concerning the verification of the value of the delivered goods for the 4th quarter of 2004.
The German payer declared in the SH for this period the supply of goods to the Czech payer in the value of EUR 86 307, but the Czech payer stated in the same period in the VAT return the acquisition of goods only in the value corresponding to EUR 35 314.
In its reply to the ŽOI, received in the Czech Republic on 9.5.2006, i.e. after the expiry of the deadline for processing laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German party stated that the application could not be processed as the German firm had ceased to operate at the end of 2005.
As the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for completing the ŽOI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents needed for tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator, using the SCAC form, requested an examination of the deliveries of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to the German payer made in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
The SAO found that there was no response from Germany to the ŽOI by the time of the audit.
The SAO also inquired with the local tax administrator that the Czech payer did not include in the VAT return deliveries of new means of transport for the German payer in the amount of CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375,472).
The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity filed the subsequent SH.
Based on the SAO’s request, BRH found that the German Customs Office had not submitted the above mentioned RUI to the local tax office for verification due to technical reasons.
Following the BRH's warning, a check was carried out at the German purchaser's premises in Germany, which established that the acquisition of all cars had been properly taxed and that the cars in question had been sold to a sub-payer in Germany.
8. According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased a passenger car worth EUR 48 500 from the German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The acquisition of these goods was not declared by the Czech payer.
By enquiring with the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.
Tax returns were not filed by the Czech payer even after requests from the tax administrator, so the tax office charged him VAT in the amount of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004 on 23 May 2005.
On 2.6.2005, the Customs Office drew attention to the aforementioned supply from the German payer.
Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator sent the Tax Inspectorate to Germany regarding the above-mentioned supply.
As the reply to the SAO was not received in the Czech Republic until 7 February 2007, it was not known how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by the international exchange until the end of the SAO audit.
The tax office cancelled the VAT registration of the Czech payer due to non-compliance with obligations arising from the VAT Act on 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial response was sent to the SAO, because the audit performed by the tax authorities at the payers was not completed at the time of the SAO and BRH audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax administrator, using the SCAC form, requested an investigation into the delivery of a car worth EUR 16 991 to a German payer in the third quarter of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
In its reply to the ŽOI, the German tax authority stated that it had only an invoice issued by a Czech taxpayer for a delivery of EUR 16 335.
Based on the SAO’s request, BRH found that the audit carried out by the German tax office at the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice, in the tax returns for August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator, using the SCAC form, requested an investigation into the delivery of cars to a German payer worth EUR 198 167, made in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent to the Czech Republic a partial reply to the ŽOI, in which it confirmed the acquisition of certain cars by the German payer and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The SAO found that the local tax office carried out several local investigations at the Czech supplier in order to verify the use of excessive VAT deductions, during which it did not detect their unauthorized use.
BRH found that the German payer had declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States for a total value of EUR 579 114 during that period and that the check carried out by the German tax office on the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.
Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the values of the intra-Community acquisition of goods declared by the recipient in the tax return and the values declared by the supplier in its SH.
The audited cases showed that the most common reasons for differences were not the time shift or the incorrect value of the intra-community delivery of goods in the SH:
11.
According to the VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods worth EUR 35 716 from the German payer in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech payer did not acknowledge this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not carry out any activities at the company's registered office, the Czech tax administrator requested to verify, as part of the international exchange of information, how the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.
The reply to the ŽOI received from Germany showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the address communicated and that the goods had been taken over by the agreed carrier.
The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer only delivered goods worth EUR 21 659.
The Czech payer sent the German payer a false confirmation of the payment of EUR 155 153 to the German payer.
After discovering fraudulent behaviour on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the supplied material, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7 916.
The SAO inquired at the local tax office in the Czech Republic and found that the tax administrator charged the Czech taxpayer VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).
On the basis of the SAO's request, BRH confirmed that the German supplier only reported the delivery of goods to the Czech payer in the amount of EUR 7,916 after repairs.
According to the German legal situation, the German payer declared the corrected values of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter in which the correction was made.
Thus, his SH contained the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax authority requested to verify, by means of an SCAC form, the supply of goods and services effected in the third quarter of 2005.
According to this GI, the Czech payer was to deliver goods totalling EUR 396 126 to the German payer during this period and to provide services amounting to EUR 11 885.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation to verify this supply with the Czech payer.
In reply to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech payer supplied the German payer with a production line including assembly.
The individual parts of the production line were delivered by the Czech payer before the Czech Republic entered the EU and after 1 May 2004 the line was assembled on the basis of the order.
The German payer did not take over the assembled line because it claimed to have defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for the amounts of EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.
The German payer accepted the issued invoices but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
The SAO also inquired with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that all invoices are duly registered in the accounts of the Czech payer.
In the VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005, only the amounts that were documented by the Czech payer and that relate to invoicing after 1 May 2004 are shown.
BRH found that on the basis of a reply from the Czech tax administration, the local tax authority in Germany concluded that the transaction concerned the supply of goods from the Czech payer to the German payer, including services for assembly.
In this particular case, the place of so-called performance of work is where the assembly of the production line took place.
Under the German VAT Act, the German recipient of the service is liable to pay VAT.
At the same time, the recipient may deduct VAT on the same amount.
As there would have been no change in the value of the VAT that the German taxpayer was obliged to pay, the corrections in the VAT return were neglected by the German tax office.
13. According to VIES data, in February 2005, Czech payer A was to purchase a machine worth EUR 58 000 from German payer C.
The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to verify this supply.
In its reply to the ŽOI, the German side stated that the machine had already been supplied to the Czech payer B by the German payer C in 2004, but that the machine should have been returned to the German payer C in October 2004.
According to information from the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but was transported to the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, the reply to the request for information showed that the German payer C had sold the machine to the Czech payer A in February 2005.
This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.
As the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intra-Community delivery of goods.
The SAO inquired with the tax administrator of the local tax payer B and found that according to VIES data, the German tax payer C delivered goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech tax payer B in the third quarter of 2004.
Tax payer B denied this acquisition of goods, so the locally competent tax administrator from the Czech Republic sent the ŽOI to Germany.
According to the reply to this request, the delivery of the machine took place.
Further investigation by the Czech tax administrator found that the machine worth EUR 88 027 was not in the accounts of the payer B, and that it could be of the same type as the one supplied by the organizational unit of the German payer C to the Czech payer A in February 2005.
The SAO also found that the Czech tax administrator of the local tax payer A carried out a local investigation of the payer.
The tax administrator was in possession of an invoice from the German payer C dated 7 February 2005, on which the payer A was listed as the purchaser of the machine.
The Czech tax administrator found out that payer A does not have this invoice included in the accounts.
Payee A had a leasing contract with another Czech company where the lease was for a machine of the same type.
The machine was handed over from the leasing company on February 9, 2005, the transport of the machine was provided by the leasing company.
The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech tax office to determine the tax liability of A.
BRH found that the German payer C did not deliver the machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.
It was therefore not an intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable transaction in Germany.
For these reasons, the German tax authorities did not recognise the German taxpayer's VAT exemption and corrected the data in his tax return.
German payer D supplied the machine to Czech payer B.
Under German law, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, BRH found that the German payer C had indicated in its SH for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth EUR 58 000 to the Czech payer A.
That supply was not verified during the tax audit carried out by the German tax office.
The following diagram shows the relationships between participants in the above commercial transactions.
14.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administration received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which the German tax administrator requested verification of an intra-community delivery from a German payer in the amount of EUR 879 680 625 to a Czech payer.
According to the German tax authority, there was a suspicion that this was a sham intra-Community supply of goods.
It was further stated in the EIT that the German payer had not engaged in any active commercial activity since 1999.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator conducted a local investigation of the Czech payer.
According to the managing director of the Czech company, the abovementioned case appeared to be a claim of a German payer against the German tax administration, which the Czech payer had filed as a partner of a German company with the German tax authority.
According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administrator has no information that the German tax administration has solved the issue related to the Czech taxpayer.
According to the available information, this was not a supply of goods, yet this value is still included in the VIES system as an intra-Community supply of goods to a Czech payer from Germany.
The main reason for the following discrepancies was that the beneficiaries did not declare intra-Community acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to VIES data, the German payer delivered goods totalling EUR 33 205 to the Czech payer between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. The Czech payer did not acknowledge this acquisition.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested verification of the supply of goods from Germany.
In response to this request, the German tax administration stated that the German payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech payer, while the remaining goods had been collected by the Czech payer himself.
By enquiring with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech tax payer submitted additional VAT returns for the above periods before receiving the reply to the Tax Office.
Despite this submission, the differences in the acquisition values were not resolved, so the Czech tax administrator recommended a tax inspection of the Czech payer.
The check has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the VIES data, the German payer delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to the Czech payer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, the Czech payer granted intra-community acquisitions only in the amount corresponding to EUR 14 856.
The Czech tax administrator requested verification within the framework of the international exchange of information of the value of the deliveries made.
The reply to the ŽOI, delivered from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total value of 31 999 EUR, i.e. the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the VIES data.
The SAO inquired with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that after receiving a reply from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the Czech tax payer's accountant and agreed with him that after examining these invoices, he would discuss with the owner of the company the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
The additional VAT return has not yet been filed.
The Czech tax administrator told the SAO that he would continue to proceed in order to comply with the deadlines for a possible additional assessment of VAT for the relevant tax period.
17.
The German payer was to deliver goods worth EUR 11 600 to the Czech payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator asked for confirmation whether the Czech payer actually existed because the alleged partner of the German payer had set up several fictitious companies in Germany.
When examining the commercial transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of the goods to the tax office.
According to the Czech payer, however, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were resold during 2005 in Germany.
The Czech payer submitted documents on the sale of goods for January 2005.
The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, he did not declare or pay the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or Germany.
All these facts suggested tax evasion in Germany and were communicated by the Czech tax authorities to the German tax authorities in their reply to the EIT.
The SAO inquired at the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic and found that the Czech payer submitted an additional VAT return for the fourth quarter of 2004, including the value of the acquisition of goods from the German payer and at the same time claimed the right to deduct tax on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.
He did not include VAT on the sale of goods in Germany in the Czech VAT return.
The Czech tax administrator assessed the additional VAT return after a local investigation without changes.
According to the Czech legislation, this case did not involve the acquisition of goods from other Member States because the goods were neither dispatched nor transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administrator therefore wrongly concluded the local investigation.
BRH found that immediately after receiving a reply from the Tax Inspectorate stating that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax authorities corrected the German taxpayer’s tax return and demanded VAT of EUR 1 600.
In addition, the relevant tax office sent a warning to the tax office of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of those goods was correctly taxed.
In the following cases, payers reported intra-community transactions that probably did not actually take place:
18.
The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech payer purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German payer in February 2005.
The application was accompanied by a copy of the certificate of registration of the Czech taxpayer for VAT.
A copy of the passport of the person who, as has been said, was to carry out the transport of that car was also enclosed.
The Czech tax administrator's investigation revealed that it was a stolen passport, the person mentioned in it did not import any vehicle into the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax entity.
The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German side, was never issued by the Czech tax authorities.
This information was included by the Czech tax administrator in his reply to the ŽOI together with the statement that he could not confirm the acquisition of the goods – the car in question.
The SAO inquired with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic and found that the Czech payer did not reside at the address given in the Commercial Register and the company manager was not in contact.
The Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech taxpayer's tax liability in the amount of CZK 0 after the complaint procedure for the tax period of February 2005.
Further investigation by the Czech tax administrator revealed that the car in question had been sold to another Czech entity, which had purchased it through an advertisement on the internet.
BRH found that, on the basis of the Czech reply to the ŽOI, the competent German tax authority would not recognise the German taxpayer’s entitlement to exemption from VAT for that supply.
19. During the inspection, the German tax office was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3 000 between the value of the goods acquired declared in the tax return of the payer and the value provided from another Member State.
It was reported that the Czech payer was to deliver goods worth EUR 89 424 to the German payer during the fourth quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the VIES data, the German tax authority requested verification of the supplies and their payment in the context of an international exchange of information.
In its reply to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been removed from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and the new managing director had not been registered.
The German recipient of the goods appeared to be a relative of a member of a Czech company.
The Czech payer filed VAT returns with the SH, which were signed by an unauthorized person – the said partner of the company – after deletion of the agent from the Commercial Register.
The accountant of the Czech payer confirmed to the tax administrator that the company partner deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.
No cash receipts were issued.
The SAO in the Czech Republic inquired at the local tax office and found that the tax administrator granted the Czech tax payer an exemption from VAT on the delivery of goods to another Member State in the amount of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the amount of CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548) in the first quarter of 2005.
BRH found that the tax authority in Germany had not corrected the VAT return of the German acquirer because a German judge had in the meantime confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
As the previous inspection did not reveal any signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to recover the tax liability assessed.
20. According to VIES data, a German payer purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth EUR 4 251 196 in 2005 after acquiring goods worth EUR 43 274 in the previous year.
In the tax return for 2004 and in the tax return for 2005, the German payer did not declare an intra-community acquisition.
Nor did it show any reasonable supply.
Because of these differences, the German tax office sent the ŽOI, relating to the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
The Czech supplier reported intra-community delivery of goods to the German payer in SH for these two quarters for a total value of CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).
On 6 September 2006, the ŽOI was delivered, in which the German side asked to check whether the intra-community deliveries declared by the Czech payer had taken place.
In its reply to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administration stated that the request of the German party could not be met because the Czech payer had no agent.
As can be seen from the documents provided by the SAO by the relevant tax administrator, on 30 March 2006 a report was drawn up with the agent of the Czech payer on the initiation of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and January to December 2005.
At the same time, the taxpayer was asked by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the aforementioned periods, but he did not submit any documents.
According to the Commercial Register, the only managing director of the Czech payer ceased to hold office on 16 May 2006, and the new managing director was not appointed.
Since April 2006, the Czech payer has stopped filing VAT returns.
In cooperation with BRH, the SAO scrutinized several cases of intra-community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of both countries.
Information on the cases examined was transmitted between the two SAIs via the two countries' CLOs.
21. The Czech company (ECR), which is not resident in Germany, has informed the relevant tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out a taxable transaction in Germany.
Because of this information, the company has been registered since June 2005 but has not received a German VAT ID.
(ECR) accepted an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind farms and for the delivery of these wind farms in the name, at the risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.
Due to a lack of its own capacity, the Czech company handed over part of the order to a German payer (ED) based in Germany.
The following diagram shows the contractual relations and the way wind power plants are transported:
According to the German legal situation, the place where such transactions take place must be determined in accordance with the following rules:
– A Danish entrepreneur (DK) sent wind farms to be installed under his name, at his own risk and on his own account in Austria.
As the installation of this supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind farms is taxable in Austria.
- As the carrier was instructed by a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and on his own account, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport started - in Germany.
Although the wind farms were dispatched to another Member State and the beneficiary is a registered payer from another Member State, the supply of the German subcontractor (ED) could not obtain the tax exemption because the other Member State of destination differs from the other Member State of residence of the Czech company.
This supply is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (CZ) deducted the input tax in its tax returns.
The place of delivery to the Czech company (ECR) is also determined at the beginning of the transport.
Transport of some wind power plants started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.
- The supply of those wind power plants that are produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The supply of other wind power plants produced in Germany took place in Germany.
So the Czech company (ECR) carried out both intra-community delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community delivery from Germany to Austria.
BRH found that the Czech company (ECR) did not record any intra-community acquisitions in its VAT return in Germany, nor did it submit SH to the German Customs Office.
So it is possible that the Czech company reported all intra-community deliveries uniformly as intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The SAO found that the ECR reported no intra-community deliveries to Austria, but intra-community deliveries to Denmark.
Examination of the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although this case does not show any evidence of tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the SAO and the SAO scrutinized the transactions to highlight the differences between the tax declaration declaration and the VIES data, which were caused by different VAT legislation in 2004.
The audited cases also demonstrate that changes in legislation require time for the application of new legislation in practice by both payers and tax authorities:
22. In the SH for the second to fourth quarters of 2004, the Czech payer reported intra-community delivery to the German payer for a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).
For the same period, another Czech payer in SH reported intra-community delivery to another German payer for a total value of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).
According to the information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.
Both Czech payers listed the above supplies in the SH in accordance with the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.
Further examination of the above-mentioned transactions revealed that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and Germany in the legal regulation of the supply or acquisition of electricity.
While in the Czech Republic the payers recorded the supply of electricity in accordance with the valid version of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as an intra-Community supply of goods, from the point of view of the German legislation in force in 2004 it was not an intra-Community acquisition, but a taxable transaction with the place of performance in Germany.
The difference in legal regulations was eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll., which amends certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of selected intra-community transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was also found that the Czech payer reported intra-community deliveries to the German payer in SH for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2005 with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 (EUR 8,071,823) and another Czech payer reported intra-community deliveries to the German payer in SH for the same period with a total value of CZK 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050).
According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.
According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2005, in the case of the supply of electricity, the place of performance is the place where the customer has his registered office, place of business or where he has an establishment for which the goods are supplied.
Therefore, Czech payers should not have reported the supply of electricity to SH in 2005.
By reporting the intra-community supply of electricity in SH, both above-mentioned payers distorted the VIES data by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).
Conclusion
The cooperation fulfilled the goals of the Czech National Bank and the SAO.
Both SAIs gained a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences between the two systems and showed that the VAT administration legislation differs.
Suspicious cases of intra-community transactions were identified during the parallel controls.
Some of them are worth checking out afterwards.
On the basis of the audit findings, both SAIs made recommendations concerning the administration of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation between the two audit institutions is the basis for the successful implementation of the following VAT management checks.
Communiqué
The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic and the President of the Bundesrechnungshof, Federal Republic of Germany.
Report on the outcome of international cooperation in excise duty administration inspections between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006
Opening Word
The joint report informs about the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, aimed at the administration of excise duties in the period after the accession of both countries to the European Union.
The cooperation was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement on control activities concluded in February 2006.
The subject of parallel controls was chosen in view of the fundamental change in the system of collection of excise duties which took place in the context of the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union as from 1 May 2004.
The functioning of the European Union's internal market requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.
The basic principle is to allow goods to circulate unencumbered up to the date of their final supply.
In accordance with that principle, the new legislation adopted in both countries allows the movement of goods under tax supervision under a suspension arrangement.
The system places great demands on the tax authorities and presupposes close cooperation between the competent administrative authorities of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud in this area.
Report on the outcome of international cooperation in excise administration controls for the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.
Introduction
Control number: (CR) 05/34 (SR) 48/11
Subject of the audit: (CR) Administration of excise duties (SR) Procedure of customs authorities in administration of excise duties
The Supreme Audit Office (SAO) of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "SAO") and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "SAO SR") concluded the "Contract on Cooperation in Audit Activities" on 8 February 2006.
The subject of the contract was cooperation in parallel audits “Administration of excise duties”, included in the audit plan of the SAO-CR for 2005 under No. 05/34, and “Control of the procedure of the customs authorities in the administration of excise duties”, included in the audit plan of the SAO-CR for 2006 under No. 48/11.
Parallel checks had the character of a coordinated check.
The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information which could not be obtained by the contracting parties during an inspection of the administration of excise duties in their national territory and in the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the inspections in the sense of the European implementing directives for the implementation of the INTOSAI auditing standards - Directive No 31.
On the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the Czech Republic"), the auditing groups from the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Western Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, Northeast Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia performed the auditing in the period from 7 February to 2 June 2006.
27 auditors were involved in the audit.
The audited bodies were the Directorate-General for Customs (‘DG’) and 11 tax offices.
Within the DG, 12 selected customs offices out of a total of 54 were audited.
The auditing operation on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Slovak Republic) was carried out by the Finance and Taxation Section of the SAO of Slovakia in cooperation with the SAO of Slovakia Banská Bystrica and Košice at 5 customs offices out of a total of 9 in the period from 13 February to 2 June 2006.
Eight inspectors were involved in the inspection.
The aim of the parallel controls was to examine the customs authorities' handling of excise duties and compliance with the relevant legislation in force in both countries and in the European Union.
International cooperation was focused on the procedure of tax administrators when supervising the transport of excise goods, in particular on the registration of initiated and terminated movements under the conditional exemption regime, and on the exchange of information within the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the excise tax administrators of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
2. Administration of excise duties
The administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic was performed by the financial authorities until 31 December 2003.
Since 1 January 2004, this agenda has been taken over by the customs authorities, which have so far collected excise duty only on importation.
In the Czech Republic, mineral oils, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products are subject to excise duty.
The state budget revenue from excise duties in the Czech Republic totalled CZK 82.8 billion in 2004, and excise duties accounted for 19.5% of the state budget revenue from taxes and duties amounting to CZK 424.7 billion.
In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duties amounted to CZK 103.6 billion and the share of the state budget revenue from taxes and fees amounting to CZK 460.4 billion was 22.5%.
In 2004, the revenue from excise duty on mineral oils for the State Budget amounted to 80% of the total revenue from this tax and in 2005 it amounted to 90.9%.
The difference to 100% of CZK 13 billion in 2004 and CZK 6.9 billion in 2005 was the income of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure.
All excise duties in Slovakia have been administered by the customs authorities since 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise duty on mineral oil, which they have administered since 1 January 2002.
Until then, excise duties were administered by the tax authorities.
In Slovakia, mineral oil, alcohol, beer, wine and tobacco products are subject to excise duty.
The revenue of the state budget from excise duties in the Slovak Republic in 2004 was a total of SKK 43.4 billion and the total tax revenue of SKK 209.5 billion was accounted for by excise duties of 20.7%.
In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duties was SKK 50 billion and the total tax revenue was SKK 222.6 billion. Excise taxes accounted for 22.5%.
Graph 1 — Comparison of revenue of the state budget of the Czech Republic from taxes and fees and tax revenue of the state budget of the Slovak Republic with revenue from excise duties
- Council Directive 92/12/EEC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (hereinafter referred to as ‘Directive 92/12/EEC’), - Council Regulation (EC) No 2073/2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as ‘Regulation No 2073/2004’), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92 on the accompanying official document for the movement of products subject to excise duty under suspension of excise duty (hereinafter referred to as ‘Regulation No 2719/92’), - Commission Regulation (hereinafter referred to as ‘excise movement within the Member State of excise duty) No 3649/EEC) for excise goods accompanying movement within the Member State of excise duty.
The basic legislation governing the issue of excise duties in the Czech Republic is Act No. 353/2003 Coll., on Excise Taxes, as amended (hereinafter referred to as "Act No. 353/2003 Coll."), which has been in force since 1 January 2004.
In the administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic, the customs authorities are, inter alia, bound by the following generally binding legislation: - Law No 98/2004 Z. z. o spotrebnej dani z minerálneho oleja v znení neskorích predpisov (hereinafter ‘Law No 98/2004 Z. z. z.’), - Law No 104/2004 Z. z. z. o. 
2.1 Movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty between Member States of the European Union
The conditions of movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty shall be governed by Directive 92/12/EEC in Title III — Movement of goods Articles 15 to 20.
According to those provisions, the transport of those goods may be effected only by an authorised warehousekeeper, who means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of a Member State to manufacture, process, store, receive and dispatch products subject to excise duty.
The consignee in another Member State may be an authorised warehousekeeper or an economic operator without the status of authorised warehousekeeper, but who may not store or dispatch such products under the duty suspension arrangement.
Authorised warehousekeeper in the Czech Republic and Slovakia means the operator of a tax warehouse, the economic operator is the authorised recipient for the repeated or one-off receipt of products subject to excise duty.
The movement of excise products under suspension of excise duty is possible under Directive 92/12/EEC only with an accompanying document.
The accompanying document shall be drawn up by the consignor in four copies before the transport begins, unless a further copy is required by the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch.
2.2 Procedure for the commencement and termination of the transport of goods under the conditional tax exemption regime between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Transport from the Czech Republic
The procedure for the commencement of transport is governed by Section 25(3) of Act No 353/2003 Coll., which states, inter alia:
‘The operator of the tax warehouse shall, before the transport of the selected products begins, inform the customs office which is locally competent of the tax warehouse from which the transport is to begin;
The transport of the selected products may be initiated only with the consent of that customs office.
The customs office shall give its consent to the transport of the selected products without delay after the condition of securing the tax has been fulfilled.’
The consignor in the Czech Republic may start the transport of all types of products subject to excise duty only with the consent of the locally competent customs office.
The customs office shall give its consent to the commencement of the transport only if a guarantee of tax equal to the amount of tax due on the transported products is provided.
The consignor shall be obliged to draw up an accompanying document in five copies before commencing transport.
The customs office shall indicate on the accompanying document the consent to the start of the transport.
Copy No 1 shall be kept by the consignor, copies No 2, 3 and 4 shall be handed over by the consignor to the carrier and copy No 5 shall be kept by the customs office authorising the transport.
Under Slovak law, the consignee in Slovakia keeps copy No 2 of the accompanying document. They shall confirm receipt of the products on copies No 3 and No 4 and present both copies to the customs office with geographical jurisdiction.
Copy No 3, certified by the customs office, shall be sent to the consignor no later than the 15th day of the month following the calendar month in which the products were received.
Copy No 4 shall be kept by the customs office of the consignee.
The transport is terminated by the receipt of the products by the consignee.
The customs office in the Czech Republic, which authorised the start of the transport, shall decide on the release of the tax guarantee within 5 working days after the presentation of copy No.3 of the accompanying document, which shall be confirmed by the consignee and the Slovak customs office.
Graph 2 — Circulation of the accompanying document for transport started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Slovak Republic
Transport from Slovakia
The procedure for the transport of ethyl alcohol and tobacco products from the Slovak Republic to another Member State of the European Union was amended as follows until 31 December 2005:
Pursuant to Paragraph 26(4) of Law No 105/2004 Z. z.
‘When transporting a lieh from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to a tax warehouse or to an authorised consignee, or to a tax plenipotentiary in the inom Member State, an odosielatel’ (supplier) is obliged on the day of the start of the transport to send a copy of the first diel of the sprievodného document electronically or by fax to the customs office of Poprad; that copy is required to be sent to the customs office in writing to the piatich of the working days from the start of the transport. “
Pursuant to Article 22(4) of Law No 106/2004 Z. z.
‘When transporting tobacco products from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to a tax warehouse or to an authorised consignee, or to a tax plenipotentiary in the inom Member State, the odosielatel’ (supplier) is obliged, on the day of the start of the transport, to send a copy of the first diel of the sprievodné document electronically or by fax to the Colné úrad Poprad; it is obliged to send that copy to the colný úrad pisomne najor to those working days of the start of the transport. “
In respect of the transport of other products subject to excise duty (mineral oil, wine and beer) during the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘audited period’), the taxpayer was not required to notify the Poprad Customs Office or the competent customs office of the start of the transport under the duty suspension arrangement.
The tax administrator became aware of the transport of these products only during a local investigation or tax inspection from the accompanying documents and accounting documents of the taxpayer.
The consignor in Slovakia is obliged to draw up an accompanying document in four copies before the transport begins.
Copy No 1 shall be retained by the consignor (for the transport of ethyl alcohol and tobacco products, a copy of copy No 1 shall be sent electronically or by fax to the Poprad Customs Office and the competent customs office).
Copy No 2, 3 and 4 shall accompany the goods being transported.
According to the Czech legislation, the consignee in the Czech Republic keeps copy No. 2 of the accompanying document issued by the consignor in the Slovak Republic and confirms receipt of the products on copies No. 3 and 4.
Confirmed copies No 3 and No 4 shall be sent to the locally competent customs office in the Czech Republic no later than the first working day after completion of the transport.
The customs office shall keep copy No 4 and return copy No 3, on which it shall check its accuracy and validity, to the consignee.
The consignee shall send copy No 3 to the consignor in SR no later than the working day following receipt of the copy.
Transport in Slovakia is considered to have ended on the date of receipt of the products by the consignee.
The consignor proves the completion of the transport by submitting copy No.3 of the accompanying document confirmed by the consignee and the tax administrator in the Czech Republic.
Graph 3 — Circulation of the accompanying document during transport (alcohol and tobacco products) started in the Slovak Republic and ended in the Czech Republic
In 2006, the Slovak Republic gradually adopted amendments to all laws on excise duties, according to which the consignor of goods under suspension of duty is obliged to send a copy of copy No.1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office of the consignor with territorial jurisdiction before the transport begins.
The document proving completion of the transport of ethyl alcohol and tobacco products shall be copy No 3 of the accompanying document certified by the consignee and his competent tax authority.
Document No 3, certified by the consignee, showing that the transport of mineral oils, wine and beer has ended.
Confirmation by the tax authorities of another Member State of receipt of the said goods by the consignee shall be required if the latter is required, under the legislation of the Member State concerned, to endorse copy No 3 of the accompanying document.
2.3 Registration of initiated and terminated transport operations kept by customs authorities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
There is no single electronic system in place to monitor the transport of goods under suspension of tax between Member States of the European Union.
Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of excise products requires Member States and the European Commission to introduce, from 1 July 2009, an electronic system (Excise Movement and Control System) to enable excise authorities in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the transport of goods.
The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently only used in paper form, and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under the suspension arrangement and to ensuring more effective control of the movement of untaxed products within all Member States.
National transport databases of the Member States will be part of this system.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all transport operations initiated and completed on the territory of the Czech Republic in the module Records of Selected Products (hereinafter referred to as "EVV").
All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have online access to the system.
In the case of transport carried out only on the territory of the Czech Republic, tax administrators can obtain information about the start or end of the transport immediately after the registration of the accompanying document by the customs office in the EVV.
The customs office shall release the tax security for the transported products provided by the consignor at the time of registration of the end of the transport by the customs office of the locally competent consignee.
Customs offices in Slovakia use a database based on the application software SysNed, which ensures the automation of their activities in the administration of excise duties and communication with the systems of the European Union.
By registering the tax warehouse, the tax warehouse operator or the beneficiary in the SysNed application software, this data is automatically transferred to the System for Exchange of Excise Data (SEED) database.
3. Preparation and conduct of cooperation
The first coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO-CR and representatives of the SAO-SR took place in January 2006.
The two parties have become acquainted with the legislation on excise duties and with the organisation of the administration of excise duties in both countries.
Particular attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia in authorising, respectively starting and ending the transport of products subject to excise duty under the duty suspension regime and the exchange of information between the excise tax authorities of both countries.
At the meeting it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak parties: - will process the total data on the quantity of excise products transported from the Czech Republic to Slovakia and vice versa, whose transport started during the audited period, - will compare the data on mineral oil transport, - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and ethyl alcohol, - Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 under the conditional exemption regime initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic and vice versa in November 2004 and September 2005.
During the inspections, the periods examined were extended by the months of October and November 2005 and during those months the transport of tobacco products under suspension of excise duty was also inspected.
Tables 1 and 2 show the total quantity of excise products transported under the duty suspension arrangement between Czech and Slovak tax subjects during the audited period.
4. Comparison of transport registers of goods under suspension of excise duty
The SAO-CR provided the Slovak side with a database of transport completed in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5 876 items listed on accompanying documents, of which 5 738 items related to mineral oils, 134 items of ethyl alcohol and 4 items related to tobacco products.
The SAO of Slovakia provided the Czech side with a database of transport completed in Slovakia, which contained a total of 3,319 items listed on accompanying documents, of which 696 items related to mineral oil, 2,066 items of ethyl alcohol and 557 items of tobacco products.
The SAO-CR compared data on transport operations listed in the register of commenced transport operations in the Czech Republic with data on terminated transport operations registered in the Slovak Republic.
The results of the comparison are presented in Table 3.
The SAO-CR compared the traffic data in November 2004 and September 2005 with the Slovak Customs Administration database, which the SAO handed over at the beginning of the audit.
The database did not contain data allowing reliable approval of individual transport operations, and therefore only 63% of the traffic initiated could be assigned.
Individual transports were assigned according to multiple data, e.g. consignor, consignee, date of transport, quantity of products transported.
Data on transport operations initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in Slovakia in October and November 2005 were compared by the SAO-CR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which contained all data according to accompanying documents, on the basis of which 93 % of the initiated transport operations were unambiguously assigned.
In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the quantity of mineral oils were given in litres or tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.
The quantity of ethyl alcohol was in most cases expressed in litres, but this could be converted into litres of absolute alcohol on the basis of the percentage of alcohol indicated in the database.
The quantities of tobacco products were given in pieces, in thousands and in kilograms, depending on the type of tobacco products.
In the case of transport operations initiated in the Czech Republic, the termination of which could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database or the quantity of products transported did not match, the accompanying documents were checked.
Documents accompanying 487 shipments of ethyl alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were checked.
The audit of these documents was carried out at the customs offices, where the SAO-CR performed the audit.
For transport operations authorised by other customs offices, accompanying documents were requested through the DG.
The Czech side asked the Slovak side to verify the realization of 141 transport operations for which the customs offices in the Czech Republic did not document the confirmed copies No.3 of the accompanying document, or the quantity of products indicated on the accompanying document did not match the quantity of products indicated in the database.
In addition, data on transport registered in the Slovak database were transmitted to the Slovak side, but this data was not included in the transport database of the Czech customs administration.
The SAO of Slovakia searched the database of the Slovak customs administration for 95 transports.
The verification of the remaining 46 shipments was requested by the locally competent customs offices, which proved their completion with copies of the accompanying documents.
The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side copies of accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport services were identified also in the Czech database, with the exception of the transport operations carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of initiated transport operations.
Examination of these cases revealed:
- in the Slovak transport database, 11 alcohol transports in the total amount of 276.7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 alcohol transports in the total amount of 404.66 litres of alcohol carried out in 2005 were registered.
The SAO-CR found that these were transports of taxed products, for which the consignor does not need the tax administrator's consent.
The consignor informed the tax administrator in writing of the start of the transport. The transport was carried out on the basis of accompanying documents used for the transport of products under a duty suspension arrangement;
- in the Slovak transport database, a total of 94 mineral oil transports, code of the Combined Nomenclature 2710 11 21, were registered in the total volume of 173 thousand litres carried out by the Czech tax entity between September 2004 and December 2005.
The SAO-CR found that between May 2004 and June 2005 the tax entity carried out transport of 102 thousand litres of untaxed mineral oils without the appropriate authorisation.
The taxpayer held a special authorisation for the receipt and use of exempt products, under which he could supply untaxed products only to the holder of the same authorisation.
He did not notify the customs office in the Czech Republic of the start of the transport and did not provide a tax guarantee of CZK 1,207,680 for the transported products.
Between July 2005 and December 2005, the taxpayer transported 71 thousand litres of taxed mineral oils to the territory of SR. Again, he failed to fulfil a legal obligation by failing to notify the customs office of the start of the transport operations.
Transport of products put into free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State may be initiated by the consignor in the Czech Republic without the consent of the customs office, but the consignor is obliged to inform the customs office in writing before the transport begins.
A taxpayer purchasing products put into free circulation in another Member State is required to declare the quantities and ensure the tax before they are taken away.
Products may be transported only with a simplified accompanying document, the particulars of which are governed by Regulation No 3649/92.
This Regulation also allows the use of an accompanying document for movements under suspension of duty, but this document must clearly indicate that it is a ‘simplified accompanying document for tax control purposes (products subject to excise duty)’.
The same rules on the transport and admission of products put into free circulation in another Member State apply in the Slovak Republic.
In those cases, the taxable persons transported the products put into free circulation with an accompanying document for transport under the suspension arrangement, the 3rd and 4th copies of which were submitted by the recipient to the tax authorities in the Slovak Republic for verification.
The customs authorities in Slovakia registered these transport operations in the database of transport under the suspension arrangement, as the accompanying documents did not state that it was a simplified accompanying document.
The SAO of Slovakia compared the transport database of the Czech customs administration with the transport database of the Slovak customs administration and found:
- in the databases, the quantity of products transported was given inconsistently, e.g. mineral oil was given in litres, in hectolitres or in kilograms; ethyl alcohol was given in litres or litres of alcohol, making it more difficult to compare the quantity of goods transported;
- the quantity of ethyl alcohol transported in the invoices did not correspond to the quantity recorded in the databases,
- not all related invoices were listed in the databases,
- two alcohol shipments from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic carried out in November 2004 in a total volume of 47 237 litres of alcohol were registered in the database of the Slovak customs administration, which were not found in the database of the Czech customs administration.
The Slovak side handed over copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side.
5. International exchange of information between customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia
Until 30 June 2005, the conditions for cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for administering excise duties were governed by Council Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxation of insurance premiums.
On 1 July 2005, Regulation No 2073/2004 entered into force, laying down the rules and procedures allowing the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange the information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties.
Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office which shall liaise with other Member States in the field of excise duty administration and shall be responsible for exchanging information on movements of excise goods.
In the Czech Republic, the “Excise Liaison Office” (hereinafter referred to as “ELO ČR”) was set up in the DG to ensure the exchange of information in the field of excise duties between the Member States of the European Union.
With effect from 1 May 2004, the ELO at the Poprad Customs Office was responsible for ensuring the management of the systems for controlling the movement of excise goods (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of information in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the Slovak Republic.
With effect from 1 July 2005, the tasks of ELO are carried out by the ELO Unit (based in Poprad) of the Excise Department of the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as ‘ELO SR’).
Under Article 3(3) of Regulation No 2073/2004, the central liaison office is responsible in particular for: - the exchange of data held in the electronic register of the SEED, - the Early Warning System Excise (EWSE), - requests for verification of movements of excise goods sent to or received from other Member States by the Movement Verification System (MVS).
The content, scope and functions of the SEED, EWSE and ISA systems are governed by Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 2073/2004.
SEED - system for the exchange of information on tax subjects trading in excise goods.
The system is made up of national excise registers and allows tax authorities in the territory of the European Union to ascertain whether products subject to excise duty are traded by a person authorised to do so.
Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States for excise purposes only.
The central liaison office of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union are able to obtain confirmation of the information held in that database.
In accordance with § 41 of Act No 98/2004 Z. z., s § 39 of Act No 104/2004 Z. z., s § 46 of Act No 105/2004 Z. z., s § 40 of Act No 106/2004 Z. z. and s § 39 of Act No 107/2004 Z. z. ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, authorised recipients and tax warehouses - the SEED database.
Customs offices in SR contribute to the SEED database by registering the tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or authorised recipient in the SysNed application software, which is automatically linked to ELO SR.
For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, beneficiary or tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, the related data are automatically transferred to the SEED database.
The SAO of Slovakia found that the exchange of SEED databases between the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place in the audited period usually once a month, exceptionally several times a month.
SR Customs received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.
The data are transferred to the SEED database in the Czech Republic from the national register in which all persons authorised to handle products subject to excise duty and issued authorisations for handling such products are registered.
Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international database SEED.
Requests from customs offices to provide information from the SEED database of other member countries are obtained only through ELO ČR.
EWSE - an early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods, through which the transport of risky consignments is announced.
Transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits laid down in a European Commission regulation and transport assessed as a risk by the tax authority are considered to be risky consignments.
The exchange of information takes two forms:
- information - sent when the specified limits are exceeded,
- a warning message - to be sent if the carriage of goods is assessed as risky.
When assessing the level of risk of a consignment, ELO SR uses the SEED database to send an alert message, on the basis of which it checks the data contained in the accompanying document.
If the data in the SEED database do not match the data in the accompanying document (for example, the registration number of the consignee of the goods or the registered office of the consignee does not match), ELO SR shall draw up an alert message to be sent to ELO of the Member State of the consignee of the goods.
In drawing up the reports, ELO follows the regulations of the Tax and Customs Commission CED 317 and CED 457, which, among other things, determine the type and quantity of goods in the respective measurement units for the production of information and warning reports.
During the audited period ELO SR sent one warning message to ELO ČR.
In the Czech Republic, information on initiated transport of products in quantities exceeding the specified limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database at the time of transport approval.
If the tax administrator in the Czech Republic evaluates the shipment as a risk based on his own analysis, he will process the so-called warning message, which he will send to the relevant Member State through ELO ČR.
In 2005 ELO ČR sent two warning messages to ELO SR.
The ISA - the system for controlling the movement of goods - makes it possible, through the ISA's requests, to check the individual movements of products subject to excise duty, as well as to check the specified route of transport between the bodies mentioned in the accompanying document.
The exchange of information takes place on the basis of a request in which the ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.
The system is used in particular in cases where the consignor accepts copy No 3 of the accompanying document and requests e.g. a refund of excise duty, and in cases where the information contained in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the SEED international database.
During the audited period, ELO SR sent 33 requests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
ELO ČR sent ELO SR 25 requests to MVS.
Customs offices in the Czech Republic most often checked the data contained in the accompanying documents, in particular the quantity of products received or dispatched or whether the consignor of products mentioned in the accompanying document is entitled to dispose of products subject to excise duty if this fact could not be verified in the international database SEED.
The MVS applications received were forwarded in both countries to the customs offices locally responsible for the consignee or consignor of excise products.
The customs authorities examined the required data and communicated the result of the investigation to the other Member State via ELO.
6. Summary
The cooperation of the SAO-CR and the SAO-SR enabled to compare the basic legislation governing the area of excise duties in both states, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the initiation and termination of transport of products under suspension of tax exemption between the two states, the registration of such transport and to compare the exchange of information between customs authorities within the framework of international cooperation.
6.1 Comparison of legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia revealed differences:
(a) the procedure followed by tax entities and tax authorities when initiating the transport of products under a duty suspension arrangement.
Transport of products under the conditional exemption regime can be initiated by a tax entity in the Czech Republic only with the consent of the tax administrator, who authorizes the commencement of transport on condition that the transported products have been provided with a tax guarantee in the amount of the tax to which they are subject.
The commencement of the transport of products under suspension of duty in the Slovak Republic is not subject to authorisation by the tax authority.
During the audited period, the taxpayer was obliged to notify the tax authorities of the start of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products.
He was able to start the transport of mineral oils, beer and wine without informing the tax authorities.
In 2006, the Slovak Republic gradually adopted amendments to all laws on excise duties, according to which the consignor of goods under suspension of duty is obliged to send a copy of copy No.1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office competent for the consignor before the transport begins.
(b) within the time limits for dispatch of copy No 3 of the accompanying document.
The recipient in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copies No. 3 and 4 of the accompanying document to the tax administrator for verification no later than the following working day after the end of the transport.
Verified copy No 3 must be sent to the sender no later than the following working day after receipt from the tax administrator.
The consignee in Slovakia is obliged to send to the consignor of the products copy No 3 certified by the tax administrator and the consignee of the products no later than the 15th day of the month following that in which he received the goods.
6.2. Customs authorities in both the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic keep electronic records of transport of products under the conditional exemption regime.
The content and method of keeping this register is not regulated by law in the Czech Republic or Slovakia.
The customs authorities in both countries enter in the register all data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport is carried out.
For the monitoring of the movement of goods under suspension of duty between Member States of the European Union, there is currently no single electronic system allowing excise authorities in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the movement of goods.
According to Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring movements of excise products is foreseen from 1 July 2009.
On the basis of the agreement on cooperation in control activities, the Czech side handed over to the Slovak side a database of transport of products under suspension of duty initiated in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.
The database contained 5 876 entries for mineral oils, ethyl alcohol and tobacco products transported.
The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side a database of transport of products under suspension of duty initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic.
The database contained 3 319 entries for mineral oils, ethyl alcohol and tobacco products transported.
The Czech side compared the data on transport operations listed in the register of commenced transport operations in the Czech Republic with the register of transport operations terminated in the Slovak Republic.
The Slovak side compared the data on the transport of goods under the conditional exemption scheme started in the Slovak Republic and ended in the Czech Republic.
Comparison of data was hampered by the fact that the quantity of goods transported was not uniformly reported in the databases.
In cases where it was not possible to unambiguously attribute the data of individual transport operations in both registers, the accompanying documents were checked and no violations of the suspensive regime or cases of tax evasion were detected.
Based on the findings of the parallel controls, it can be concluded that the transport register can provide Member States with valuable information to improve the administration of excise duties.
The establishment of an electronic system for the movement and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council will allow the electronic transmission of the movement document and more effective control of movements under suspension of excise duty within the territory of the European Union.
Communiqué
This report was drawn up in the Czech, English and Slovak languages.
The report was signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic.
Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the results of the follow-up
Opening Word
Taxes are generally a key source of public revenue.
It goes without saying that the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) should focus their attention on this area.
An example is value added tax (VAT) fraud.
In their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated each year in the European Union (EU).
Already in 2005, the participants of the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.
In the framework of this cooperation, SAIs can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.
VAT is a very suitable area for control cooperation as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, BRH) conducted the first parallel audit in the field of VAT in 2006.
The report was published in 2008.
As VAT fraud is not confined to a single country but is widespread throughout the EU, close cooperation between SAIs is needed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this problem.
Both SAIs therefore decided to further develop their cooperation in this area and carried out a parallel follow-up.
1. Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of the audit: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration (D) Bilateral audit with SAO (follow-up)
Objective of control:
(CZ) The aim of the auditing operation was to examine the procedure of the tax authorities in the administration of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure for dealing with selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany"), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries in the framework of international cooperation.
(D) The auditing operation was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.
It was also intended to cover other areas related to VAT.
The resulting control findings were intended to be compared with established good practice (if any).
The audited period covered the years 2006 to 2008 and, in the case of relevant connections, the preceding and following periods until the end of the audit.
2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
The subsequent verification of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.
During previous parallel inspections, suspicious cases of intra-community transactions were detected.
Some of them required further examination.
On the basis of the audit findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations concerning the administration of VAT.
The follow-up carried out was to evaluate the measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine the selected suspected cases.
The audit also focused on selected cases of high-risk intra-community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of claims and the implementation of VAT checks on large tax entities.
During the audit of the VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, the auditors came to the following audit findings:
1. Previous inspection recommendations
• Recommendation 1: Conditions for the registration of payers should be harmonised across the EU
In previous parallel inspections, a comparison of the VAT registration systems in the two countries revealed differences.
As the different ways of registering pose problems, both SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registering payers within the EU.
This recommendation has been put forward at EU level.
The proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003") called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including the VAT payer tax identification number database.
He also amended the common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The SAIs expected EU Member States to agree on appropriate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.
However, the latest version of the document, agreed by the EU Member States in the ECOFIN framework, no longer covers the issue.
Both SAIs regret that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
However, they continue to see this intention as a relevant prevention tool in the fight against VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly Summary Reporting
In the context of international cooperation, a previous monitoring exercise recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements to allow for a more timely verification of intra-community transaction values.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions reduces the period for which recapitulative statements of intra-EU transactions are submitted to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented from 1 July 2010.
In Germany, the obligation to submit monthly recapitulative statements was not introduced by the deadline in accordance with the applicable EU rules, while in the Czech Republic it was.
• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and consideration of linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted BRH’s recommendation and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.
Work is still ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Sharing the successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level Based on the results of the previous control action, both SAIs agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system need to be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.
If this is not the case, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The audit found that our two Member States have different risk management systems which have their own strengths and weaknesses.
In this area, the SAO audited EUROCANET, which allows the exchange of information within the EU, while BRH focused on the German participation in the so-called risk management platform.
2. Follow-up of selected intra-community transactions
During the previous audit operation, business transactions where there were doubts about their completion or irregularities in the reporting of business transactions in tax returns or recapitulative statements by taxpayers from both countries were jointly examined.
Both SAIs selected nine cases for follow-up, which included intra-community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
The inspections carried out by the tax authorities of the countries concerned have not been concluded by the date of completion of our previous joint inspection operation.
The subsequent audit operation verified that most of the tax procedures related to the selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany were concluded and that adequate measures were taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional adjustment of VAT or avoidance of input tax refund).
3. Check selected risk intra-community transactions
High-risk cases of intra-community transactions carried out by EU payers included in EUROCANET were selected for the audit.
EUROCANET is a tool for detecting risky tax payers within the EU.
Member States' participation in the scheme is voluntary.
The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active scheme participant if some Member States refuse to participate actively.
Due to the fact that the German tax administration did not participate in the EUROCANET data exchange, it was not possible to obtain any information on which suppliers with the German VAT ID were assessed as being at risk.
As part of the audit, the SAO found cases of common commercial transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent behaviour related to VAT.
Tax authorities have limited possibilities of controlling risky transactions, especially with regard to missing traders, and mere physical verification of documents can hardly prove any fraudulent behaviour to the taxpayer.
A similar situation arises for the tax authorities when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intra-Community carousel shops.
In such cases, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities in order to identify goods and irregularities in transport documents and also to monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the final consumer.
Germany, like some other countries, is hesitant to actively participate in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.
In Germany, other tools are being used to detect high-risk taxpayers, which have so far proved useful to the German tax administration.
There is a need to communicate and exchange experiences between EU Member States in this area.
The EU Council reached a political agreement on a draft regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Its main innovation is the creation of the EUROFISC network.
The experience gained so far in using EUROCANET should feed into the creation of this new VAT fraud network.
4. Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims
In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States follow the same European legislation.
Therefore, the way in which requests for international recovery assistance are handled is the same in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The SAO and the SAO compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not match.
Both SAIs consider it useful to renegotiate the statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent inconsistencies.
Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, SAIs agree that reliable statistics should contain more information on VAT.
It would probably be useful for the Commission to produce, on the basis of more detailed statistics, an analysis to help Member States to strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.
In the view of both SAIs, this means helping Member States with low recovery rates to increase their recovery rates to at least the EU average.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.
5. Scrutiny of large tax entities
SAI analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control of large tax entities (VDS) in both countries.
In addition, they gathered information from tax authorities by means of a questionnaire on the areas that SAI considered essential for managing this issue.
It is clear from the replies received that the situation in the two countries is developing differently.
The Czech Republic has a system in place to guide the selection of risk-prone cases based on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from tax inspections carried out, data from balance sheets and profit and loss statements, etc.).
This ensures efficient management and analysis of VAT control in general.
A dedicated financial office for the management of VDS is planned to be established in 2012.
A similar system does not yet exist in Germany, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT controls in general.
Germany has so far focused more on selecting the individual cases in question, in particular on the basis of data from the VAT return and recapitulative statement.
The analysis of these data relies on different risk management components, which will be reinforced.
3. Progress of control action
3.1 Progress of the audit operation in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by the Division II of the State Budget Revenue Department and the territorial departments IX. Plzeň, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.
The audited bodies were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also “the Czech Ministry of Finance”) and 25 financial authorities (hereinafter also “FÚ”): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ Břeclav, FÚ Domažlice, FÚ Hodonín, FÚ in Hradec Králové, FÚ in Cheb, FÚ in Jablonec nad Nisou, FÚ in Karlovy Vary, FÚ in Ostrava, FÚ FÚ in FÚ, FÚ FÚ, FÚ FÚ in Prague, FÚ4.
The audit conclusion of this audit operation was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.
3.2 The follow-up in Germany
The audit was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the Indirect Tax Inspection Service and by the staff of the designated Regional Audit Offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
Following the selection of a sample of cases, a number of Länder were informed of the mission of the inspection operation.
In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the auditing operation took place in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.
Included were the tax files of the following tax authorities: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Tax Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);
In addition, discussions took place with the tax offices of Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-jih) and with the tax directorates of Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
A report on the audit findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions
As part of the preparation of the parallel control actions, a meeting of representatives of the two audit institutions was held in September 2008 to discuss and determine control topics.
Subsequently, in December 2008, the leaders of both SAIs signed an agreement to cooperate in the implementation of parallel controls.
At the Bonn meeting in June 2009, the audit teams informed each other of the initial results achieved during the preparation of the audit, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on the way forward.
The second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The inspection teams exchanged previously collected findings and agreed on a timetable for the preparation of the joint report.
Both SAIs decided to focus on: • follow-up of the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • screening of selected cases of intra-community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not resolved during the previous parallel check; • screening of selected cases of intra-community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high-risk cases; • checking of the tax administration's progress in the area of international assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • tax audits of large companies.
A report on the results of the parallel control actions was prepared during a workshop in June 2010.
4. Control of VAT administration in selected areas
4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from previous inspection
4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Conditions for the registration of payers should be harmonised across the EU.
Based on the results of the previous audit, the SAO recommended modification of the conditions of VAT registration and introduction of a new rule for cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.
The modified conditions should make it possible to reduce more effectively the risk of possible evasion of VAT collection.
In this context, it was found that the tax authorities in some cases did not use the right to cancel the VAT registration of taxpayers who did not comply with the obligations arising from Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT Act").
The Czech Ministry of Finance has not yet proposed an amendment to the provision introducing an obligation for tax administrators to cancel VAT registration for taxpayers in case of repeated non-submission of VAT returns.
According to the VAT Act, the tax administrator may cancel the registration of the tax payer “ex offo” in cases where: (a) the payer has not performed, without giving the tax administrator a reason, for a period of twelve consecutive months of performance; (b) the payer has not fulfilled his obligations under this Act; (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.
In the previous audit, it was found that the applicable legislation allowed the Tax Office for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration on 31 January of the following calendar year for so-called non-established payers who did not incur any obligation to declare and pay the tax during the current calendar year.
The FCO for Prague 1 often did not cancel the VAT registration of these payers, because the relevant provision provided for insufficient time for the cancellation of the registration.
This problem was remedied by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.
The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of the non-established taxpayer in case the taxpayer has not supplied any taxable goods or services or exempt goods or services with the right to deduct VAT in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly Summary Reporting
In the context of international cooperation, a previous monitoring exercise recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements.
The Council Directive reduces the period for which recapitulative statements of intra-EU transactions are submitted to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.
There is also a new obligation to submit recapitulative statements in electronic form.
The payer must also submit a recapitulative statement where the services for which the place of supply is determined in accordance with Paragraph 9(1) of the VAT Code are supplied to a taxable person in another Member State and where the customer is obliged to declare and pay the tax on those services.
This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements to achieve greater reliability of VIES data This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.
The Czech administration compares data on intra-community transactions reported in VAT returns and recapitulative statements of Czech payers automatically in the ADIS system.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level
The proper collection of VAT is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
The fight against VAT fraud is therefore an area of priority concern and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this fight is evidenced, inter alia, by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to establish the difference between the eligible and the actual VAT collected in the 25 EU Member States (hereinafter "EU-25") during the period 2000-2006.
On the basis of an analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concluded that the estimated loss of uncollected VAT for this period is between EUR 90 and 113 billion, with an average of 12% of eligible VAT not collected annually in the EU-25.
For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18%.
In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action noted that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in every EU Member State.
As regards the risk management system, the SAO audited the EUROCANET system for the exchange of information in the EU.
Cases of risky intra-community transactions carried out by EU tax payers included in EUROCANET were selected for the audit (see chapter 4.3).
The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and improving the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved by setting up the EUROFISC network, which should improve the cooperation of the responsible authorities in a way that allows fraud to be detected in its infancy.
This network should also become an important source of information for the risk assessment of intra-Community transactions at a later stage.
The ECOFIN Council already approved the creation of EUROFISC on 7 October 200812, setting out the basic principles that will guide the network.
The image of EUROFISC is the already functioning system of rapid and selective exchange of information EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.
The aim of this system is to detect risky commercial transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Evaluation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report revealed the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Conditions for the registration of payers should be harmonised across the EU.
The German tax administration has set up a well-functioning tax payer registration system based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance drew the Commission's attention to this system in October 2007.
Improvements to the system shall be made on an ongoing basis.
Currently, the questionnaire data are processed electronically and will subsequently be used for the survey as part of risk management already during registration.
The Commission presented a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.
BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to secure the level of standards already achieved in this area in Germany.
Recommendation 2
Monthly Summary Reporting
The Act on the transposition of EU Directives into national law was adopted on 8 April 2010.
This law contains provisions on the monthly submission of recapitulative statements of intra-community deliveries.
Those provisions entered into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and consideration of linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
A joint working group composed of workers from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance was set up.
The group has developed a strategy for the automatic comparison of data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
This strategy is still being discussed in the Länder.
Furthermore, the Task Force looked at a tool designed to optimise the control procedure for transactions in the internal market.
Recommendation 4
Sharing of successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.
Germany participates in this exchange within the so-called risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the idea of such a platform and, following a written consultation on 18 October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.
The members of the Platform are further divided into sub-groups dealing with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • influencing negotiations, • evaluation, • updating the Risk Management Guide.
Reports on the performance of these sub-groups were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and deregistration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.
The proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included an extension of existing databases within the EU, including the database of VAT payers' tax identification numbers.
It also regulated common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The issue of registration and deregistration has for the time being been left to the national legislations of the EU Member States.
Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.
BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already achieved in Germany does not fall.
On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached a political agreement on that draft regulation.
The aim of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
Member States have to implement national procedures and are only required to report these to the Committee on Administrative Cooperation.
Both SAIs deplore the failure of the Commission to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, as both SAIs consider this measure to be an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.
They would therefore welcome further efforts by the Commission in this direction.
Monthly Summary Reporting
In the context of international cooperation, a previous monitoring exercise recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements, allowing for more timely verification of intra-community transaction values.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions reduces the period for which recapitulative statements of intra-EU transactions are submitted to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010; in Germany, it took effect on 1 July 2010.
Germany has not introduced an obligation to submit recapitulative statements monthly according to a set calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in line with EU directives).
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and consideration of linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the BRH recommendation and set up a working group to find possible solutions.
Work is ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.
Sharing successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level
Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.
The SAO audited the EUROCANET system for the exchange of information in the EU (see chapter 4.3).
In this area, BRH concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.
4.2 Follow-up of selected intra-community transactions
In the previous audit, the implementation of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their completion, or irregularities in the way the payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their VAT returns or recapitulative statements, was jointly examined.
The two audit institutions selected nine cases involving intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany for follow-up, the verification of which carried out by the tax administrations of both countries had not been completed during the previous joint audit operation.
1)
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech payer purchased goods worth EUR 22 686 from a German payer.
This acquisition of goods was not declared by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return, because the German taxpayer did not have a VAT ID during that period, but only a tax number for domestic transactions in Germany.
On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that, under the German VAT Act, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not need to have a VAT ID in order to exempt intra-Community supplies of goods from VAT.
Subsequent audit of the SAO found that on the basis of an audit carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech payer submitted a supplementary VAT return in which he declared the acquisition of goods in the stated value and at the same time claimed the right to deduct VAT in the same amount in this tax return.
2)
The Czech payer should have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from the German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The acquisition of these goods was denied by the Czech payer and did not appear in his VAT return.
Upon request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax administration refused to cooperate as the turnover of the transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.
As the Czech tax authority did not obtain evidence, it terminated the inspection without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.
Subsequent audit The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator received two spontaneous information from Germany pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer invoiced the goods to Slovakia.
The Czech payer purchased the goods from the Slovak payer and stated this acquisition in the regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.
3)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to purchase a passenger car worth EUR 48 500 from the German payer.
The acquisition of the goods in question was not declared by the Czech taxpayer.
Since August 2004, this payer has not filed VAT returns, so the tax administrator has charged VAT of CZK 0 for this quarter.
On the basis of information obtained from Germany in the framework of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, in March 2007 the tax administrator invited the payer to submit a supplementary VAT return, which was not submitted by the payer.
Subsequent inspection revealed that the tax administrator carried out further tax proceedings in 2007, which showed that the passenger car in question had been sold by the Czech payer to a used car dealership in the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax authority issued a tax assessment notice for the December 2004 tax period, which additionally assessed VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and their subsequent sale in the amount of CZK 295 379.
By order of the Regional Court, the Czech payer was dissolved with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.
In the absence of enforcement of the taxpayer’s attachable assets, this arrears appears to be irrecoverable.
4)
The Czech payer was to deliver new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany during the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005 for a total value of EUR 198 167.
The response to the request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that open tax and criminal proceedings were pending against the German entity in Germany.
During a follow-up, BRH was informed that, following the conclusion of the tax proceedings in Germany, it had been established that the German taxpayer had been involved in fraudulent activities.
The intracommunal acquisition of goods was taxed at a value of EUR 182 424 (2004) and EUR 369 690 (2005).
The SAO found out that the Czech payer was involved in carousel shops with new means of transport.
On the basis of information from the German tax administration concerning the verification of supplies of goods, a VAT audit was initiated with the Czech tax entity for the tax years April, May and June 2005.
On the basis of the audit findings and information obtained in the context of the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additionally assessed VAT for the period May 2005 at CZK 703 031 and for the period June 2005 at CZK 726 551.
5)
In February 2005, Czech payer A was to purchase a machine from a German payer for a total value of EUR 58 000.
This German payer was supposed to deliver a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech payer B in the third quarter of 2004, but the payer B denied this acquisition of goods.
Subsequent audit of the SAO found that the payer B purchased the machine from a German company that had established an organizational unit in the Czech Republic.
Czech payer A did not declare the acquisition of goods from the German payer in his VAT return.
The response from the German tax authority to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German payer did not make an intra-Community delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000, but delivered the goods within the Czech Republic.
BRH’s follow-up found that, following a tax audit, the intra-Community supply of the machine had been reclassified as a domestic supply of the machine and the VAT exemption had been abolished.
6)
The German taxpayer was to deliver goods worth EUR 11 600 to the Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator assessed the submitted additional VAT return, which wrongly indicated the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State, including the acquisition of goods in the specified value.
BRH found that, after receiving a reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax authority corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and made an additional VAT assessment of EUR 1 600.
The further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany are subject to a tax audit.
The recapitulative statement of the German payer has not yet been corrected because only the payer who submitted the recapitulative statement can make corrections to recapitulative statements in Germany.
7)
The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as to whether the Czech taxpayer purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech taxpayer for the amount of CZK 0 after the tax procedure for the tax period of February 2005 and informed the German tax administrator that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
A subsequent audit of the SAO revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 for non-compliance with obligations and the Czech tax administrator sent the documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.
Subsequent inspection by BRH found that the German payer had changed his registered office and the new locally competent tax authority had revoked his VAT exemption on the supply of the car in question to the Czech payer on the basis of the inspection carried out.
The German taxpayer has not yet corrected the data in the recapitulative statement and has lodged an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.
8)
According to the VIES data, the German taxpayer supplied goods totalling EUR 33 205 to the Czech taxpayer between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
A subsequent audit of the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator tried to find out the causes of the differences created by the Czech tax payer when acquiring goods in the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer has repeatedly submitted a supplementary VAT return for the first quarter of 2005.
The Czech tax administrator did not explain the difference in the value of the purchased goods amounting to CZK 134 273 for the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005, because according to the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture the commercial transactions for each quarter and therefore the tax administrator accepted the submitted additional tax returns.
9)
The German taxpayer delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to the Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, the Czech payer granted an intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14 856.
The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of deliveries made as part of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of the supply of goods of EUR 31 998, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT return and the data listed in the VIES system.
Subsequent audit of the SAO revealed that the Czech payer filed a supplementary VAT return for the tax period July 2004 up to January 2007 after many urges from the tax administrator.
In that tax return, the taxpayer at the same time exercised the right to deduct VAT, thus leaving the tax liability for that tax period unchanged.
The follow-up check verified that in selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most of the tax procedures had been completed and that the tax authorities in both the Czech Republic and Germany had taken adequate measures (i.e. additionally assessed VAT or prevented the refund of input tax).
4.3 Checking selected risk intra-community transactions
4.3.1 Results of the audit in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information for the detection of risk takers within the Member State where the goods were acquired.
In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from EUROCANET was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with the data on the acquirers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic has been sending data to EUROCANET on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers.
Within the framework of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system were selected for the audit.
They acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.
EUROCANET captured relevant data from tax administrations from other Member States.
As the German tax administration did not participate in the EUROCANET data exchange, it was not possible to obtain any information that would help to establish whether suppliers with a German VAT ID were classified by the German tax administration as being at risk.
The audit operation revealed cases of normal commercial transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or VAT fraud.
Where applicable, tax administrations have used the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
For example:
• The tax authorities did not reveal any suspicions of involvement in risky transactions when verifying the signal information.
The tax authorities continuously monitor such tax entities for their inclusion in EUROCANET.
• During the verification of risky transactions, the tax authorities did not show deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax base and VAT in the accounts submitted, even though they found irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or revealed business relations with suspicious or non-contact companies from other Member States.
• The verification of commercial transactions was complicated as some taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax authorities and could not be contacted.
For the most part, the locally competent tax authorities scrutinised the risky tax entities and the risky transactions listed in the EUROCANET signal information.
Tax authorities have limited possibilities when examining risky transactions, in particular in relation to missing traders, and it is difficult to prove fraudulent behaviour to the taxpayer simply by physically examining the documents.
Stricter VAT registration requirements and more flexible cancellation of registrations would help reduce missing trader fraud.
In the case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered for the purpose of reporting fictitious deliveries of goods within the EU or for the purpose of issuing formally correct tax documents to taxpayers who unduly deduct input VAT on the basis of these documents.
In cases where there is suspicion of the involvement of tax entities in carousel transactions and other fraud and where goods are imported and exported from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities.
Closer cooperation between these authorities would help in identifying goods and irregularities in transport documents, as well as in monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the final consumer.
The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in EUROCANET was assessed by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness of EUROCANET which should be remedied by the establishment of a mandatory EUROFISC network.
4.3.2 Inspection results in Germany
BRH analysed the information available from the Federal Central Tax Office, which included EUROCANET data.
That information was the criterion for selecting the six files of German taxpayers for inspection.
Like some other countries, Germany has refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.
As a result, Germany has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but only receives data from EUROCANET.
The justification for this position is contained in the following statement: ...in the Government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.
There is currently no legal basis for violating the applicable rules on tax secrecy.
In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such data are used in EUROCANET by other Member States. “17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been carrying out analyses of EUROCANET data and forwarding them to the Länder tax authorities in accordance with the agreed procedure.
The German tax authorities receive audit information on the direct business relations of the payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in EUROCANET.
However, the German tax authorities do not receive any information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relations with traders from other Member States who also have business dealings with the German trader in question.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, the inspection in the area had to be carried out in different ways.
However, the results did not reveal major differences in the detection of VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.
The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to set up a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the EU reached a political agreement on the draft regulation, the main contribution of which lies in the establishment of EUROFISC.
Experience gained from the use of EUROCANET data should also be part of the envisaged VAT fraud network.
Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.
On the other hand, the cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemptions in intra-Community transactions appears to be necessary.
4.4 Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims
4.4.1 International recovery assistance in the Czech Republic
In particular, the following Directives provide for international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:
• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;
• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and customs duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;
• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
In the Czech Republic, Council Directive 76/308/EEC was implemented by Act No 252/2000 Coll., on International Assistance for the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims.
After the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it was necessary to implement this Directive into the Czech legal order and at the same time to amend the aforementioned Act No. 252/2000 Coll.
In this context, a new Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on International Assistance for the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims, was adopted.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28.11.2008 is a new regulation in the system for regulating international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU.
The annex to the Regulation sets out new models of requests, which are to be used from 1 January 2009, newly establishes the obligation of electronic communication and the obligation of the requesting authority to confirm the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.
Guiding principles for the provision of international debt recovery cooperation:
1. reciprocity;
2. assistance is always provided only on the basis of an application containing the prescribed particulars;
3. the assistance does not cover financial claims which are in the nature of a criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. the provision of international recovery assistance shall be governed by the national law of the State in which the assistance is requested;
5. foreign claims do not have priority for recovery;
6. assistance shall be provided only for the recovery of uncontested claims;
7. the principle of exhaustion (the requesting State has, without success, made use of all available possibilities to recover a claim under its legal system).
Act No. 191/2004 Coll. defines three forms by which assistance takes place, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the actual recovery of claims.
Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States
The locally competent tax office electronically sends the request for information, the request for service or the request for recovery of claims together with the relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the financial directorates.
The Czech Ministry of Finance will provide a translation of the application into the relevant language, scan it including the annexes and send it via the CCN/CSI network to the competent tax authority of the designated state.
There are two basic requirements for recovery: the claim must be more than EUR 1 500 and not more than 5 years old.
If the above requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse enforcement.
Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States
On receipt of an application from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must acknowledge receipt of the application as soon as possible and within seven days at the latest.
If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the rejection of the request, indicating the specific provisions of the Directive on which it relies.
This notification shall be sent no later than three months after the date of the acknowledgement of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance verifies whether the application has all the elements required by law and should immediately forward the application through the Financial Directorate to the local tax office for processing.
If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator, among other things, identifies the debtor's assets, e.g. by obtaining extracts from the real estate register, checking bank accounts, verifying the registration of vehicles at the DMV, etc.
After a period of six months from the date of acknowledgement of receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance should communicate to the requesting authority the result of the enquiry carried out in order to obtain the requested information.
In the case of non-contacting tax subjects, where it is not possible to recover the claim, the applicant authority should also be informed thereof.
Any sum recovered by the tax authority shall be transferred to the applicant authority in CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.
It is not inconceivable that the Czech tax administrator recovering foreign claims will allow it to be deferred or paid in instalments, provided that the State which requested the recovery agrees.
During the recovery period, the debtor is prescribed interest or penalty payments in accordance with Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.
This interest or penalty payment belongs to the State which requested the recovery.
In the case of received requests for recovery, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not send requests to the local tax authorities to be processed in time, especially in 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was found in the context of international recovery assistance in the case of requests received from tax authorities in the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not comply with Act No. 191/2004 Coll. because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in the recovery within six months of the date on which receipt of the application was confirmed.
This situation has been improving since 2008.
Statistics
The Czech Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(4) of Act No. 191/2004 Coll., processes every year until 15 March statistical data for the European Commission indicating the number of requests for information, delivery or recovery sent or received in the past year and indicating the amount of the claims to which the requests relate.
On the basis of the documentation provided by all EU Member States, the European Commission prepares a report on the state of recovery for submission to the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.
The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated the statistical data due to an error in the item of recovered receivables in 2008 by EUR 5 250 000 by indicating the incorrect value of the recovered receivable for VAT (this was a shift of the decimal point after the conversion of the receivable from Czech crowns into the value in euros).
This error was subsequently reflected in the European Commission's statistics.
Information on mutual assistance, including the amounts recovered, is given in the table below.
4.4.2 International recovery assistance in Germany
The legal mandate for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In order to make its wording more accessible and easier to understand, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have already been substantially amended several times.
The provisions apply, inter alia, to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into national German law by the State Tax Collection (EC) Act of 3 May 2003.
The recovery procedure in Germany is governed by the German Fiscal Code.
Article 117.2 of the Code stresses that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities in force in national jurisdiction and on the basis of the EC Act on Administrative Assistance.
Part Six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346) lays down statutory provisions governing the enforcement procedure.
The administrative operations of the tax authorities are governed in particular by the instructions for execution and the instructions for enforcement.
The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with the representatives of the Länder (Supreme Tax Offices) on the principles of administrative assistance for the assessment of taxes and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The general conditions for lodging claims for recovery are as follows:
• Legal requirements must be fulfilled (Sections 251 and 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).
• All available domestic means of enforcement have already been exhausted.
• Claims which are the subject of requests for recovery assistance must be definitive.
• No more than 5 years may elapse between the issuing of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim becomes final (i.e. it is no longer subject to appeal) and the date on which the application is submitted.
• The total amount of the claim must be more than EUR 1 500.
Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States
German requests for recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the implementing departments of the tax authorities to the relevant foreign office, such as the Czech Customs Office, through the intermediary office and the Federal Central Tax Office.
The detailed procedure follows the Methodological Guideline on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery of Receivables) of 19 January 2004.25 Currently, a working group of the federal and provincial governments is reviewing this methodological guideline in order to adapt it to the Recovery Directive.
The application, including annexes, shall be submitted electronically by the tax office to the intermediate office.
That authority shall check the correctness of the application in terms of content and form.
If the application is not correct, it is returned to the relevant tax office.
If it meets all the requirements, it is transferred to the Federal Central Tax Office.
Subsequently, the Federal Central Tax Office will ensure the necessary communication with the competent foreign office and provide a translation of the application.
Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery received from other Member States shall be registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and a receipt shall be sent within 10 days.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office will check whether the formal requirements have been fulfilled.
The Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the Intermediate Office, which forwards them to the competent tax authorities and monitors their execution.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.
If the application takes more than 6 months to be processed, the intermediate office shall request a preliminary report to be submitted in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EC.
Once the formal and factual elements of the application have been checked, the implementing services shall notify the means of recovery.
Any sums recovered shall be transferred to the bank account specified in the application within one month of their receipt.
Statistics
Information on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims between Germany and the Czech Republic in the years 2006-2008 (as at 31.12.2008) is contained in the following table.
4.4.3 Recovery check, case studies
Within the framework of international cooperation, 21 applications for international assistance in the recovery of claims between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for examination.
Examination of ten selected cases revealed, among others:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received from Germany a request for recovery of a VAT claim for the years 2004 and 2005 for a total amount of EUR 3 883, i.e. CZK 109 820, from a Czech tax entity.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send a request for recovery to the tax authority until 26 February 2008.
In order to secure the enforced claim, the Czech tax administrator established a lien on real estate owned by a Czech tax entity.
Since it was not possible to pay the entire enforced debt by mortgage, a payment plan with instalments of at least CZK 2,000 per month was agreed with the Czech tax entity.
On 31 August 2009, information was sent to the German tax administration on the state of recovery of the claim, with the claim being partially recovered in instalments of CZK 49 600 as of 25 August 2009.
This sum was sent to Germany and a further instalment of CZK 3 000 was sent to Germany on 28 August 2009.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for the recovery of tax arrears of a Czech taxpayer who owed EUR 180 869, i.e. CZK 4 434 915, in Germany in respect of VAT and income tax and accessories.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the tax administrator until 27 November 2008.
By examining the ownership of bank accounts, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movable property, the tax administrator found that the debtor does not own any executable property.
Furthermore, the on-the-spot investigation revealed that the debtor had not stayed at his permanent address for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.
This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and on 16 April 2009 the tax administrator's reply was sent to the German tax administration.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received from Germany a request for recovery concerning tax arrears on turnover tax and accessories of the Czech tax entity amounting to EUR 3 139, i.e. CZK 84 846.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery of this claim to the tax administrator on 6 August 2008, although on 18 February 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the claim in Germany.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax authorities that the request for recovery had been processed by the payment of the claim by a Czech taxpayer in Germany.
However, the claim in question was also recovered in the course of recovery in the Czech Republic and transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the long time-limits within which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the authorised tax administrators, the claim was paid twice in this case - by the entity itself in Germany and by the Czech tax administrator.
In cooperation with BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been set off against the claim of a further request for recovery of EUR 6 649 to be sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance registers only a request for recovery of the claim in the amount of EUR 3 139 with this company, the request for recovery of the claim in the amount of EUR 6 649 does not appear in the register of the Czech Ministry of Finance with this company.

On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for the recovery of tax arrears of a Czech taxpayer who owed EUR 39 957, i.e. CZK 956 654, in respect of income tax and VAT and accessories in Germany.
On 19 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the Czech tax administrator.
On 1 June 2009, a procedure for the recovery of the claim was initiated, execution was ordered on the attachment of the claim to accounts with banks in the Czech Republic and on the deduction from wages (the deduction amounted to CZK 7 000).
During negotiations with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he did not agree with the amount of the claim and considered it questionable.
The Czech tax authority found that the taxpayer had in the past been willing to repay EUR 250 per month, which was not accepted by the German tax authority.
The taxpayer promised to discuss the application with the German tax authorities in order to obtain a change in the amount of its claim.
Enforcement of the claim continued during the audit operation of the SAO.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning a Czech taxpayer who owed a total of EUR 113 444, i.e. CZK 3 116 304, in income tax for 2005 and in turnover tax for 2003-2007 and accessories.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the application to the Tax Office for Prague 1, which is in charge of tax administration for non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, until 14 November 2008, because it was not possible to determine the tax administrator locally on the basis of the address given to the tax entity.
During the investigation, the FÚ was informed that the debtor had an income of EUR 4 704 on 19 September 2008; however, the FÚ could no longer issue an execution order for this amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance did not transmit the request for recovery until after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax administrator initiated the enforcement of the claim and issued an execution order to establish the claim against the debtor's funds in accounts opened with banks and savings and credit cooperatives.
Enforcement of the claim continued during the audit operation of the SAO.
6.
The Czech tax administrator requested international cooperation in the recovery of the VAT claim and the costs of the proceedings totalling CZK 146 223 742 on 3 October 2006.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send this request for recovery to the German tax administration until 13.5.2008.
On 8 September 2008, the German tax authority transferred to the Czech authorities via the Bundesbank the amount obtained from the seizure of funds in the debtor's account in the amount of EUR 17 700, i.e. CZK 439 226.
An error in the recalculation of the amount recovered was detected during the verification of the volume of recoveries.
The amount of CZK 146 223 742 recovered was converted at EUR 1 = CZK 25,065, erroneously to EUR 583 378.
The correct conversion of the amount recovered amounts to EUR 5 833 781,83.
A request for recovery was therefore sent to Germany, which was lower by EUR 5 250 404.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance to recover a tax arrears from a Czech taxpayer who owed CZK 1 970 632, or EUR 79 847, in respect of VAT and accessories.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the application to the German tax administration until 10.11.2008.
On 4 February 2009, the German tax authority requested the debtor to pay the arrears.
In view of the significant decrease in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the related liquidation situation of the company, the following payments were made to cover the arrears: EUR 4 600 on 8.4.2009, EUR 3 000 on 6.5.2009 and EUR 2 500 on 16.6.2009.
These payments were sent to the account of the tax administrator in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, the German tax authorities agreed with the debtor to pay a further instalment of EUR 2 500 by 30 June 2009.
8.
The request for recovery totalling EUR 398 653, i.e. CZK 9 832 779, including the real estate transfer tax claim, was received from the Czech tax administrator at the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2 October 2008.
On 3 April 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a communication from the German tax administration that the application had been returned by the German tax administration.
The German tax authorities justified the refund on the grounds that the tax on the transfer of immovable property was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) or (h) of Council Directive 2008/55/EC.
The German tax authorities also stated that Article 2(g) concerns claims relating to income tax and wealth tax.
Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and capital listed in Article 1(3) in conjunction with Article 4 of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed to draw up and submit a new request for recovery, excluding arrears of real estate transfer tax amounting to CZK 61 759 and including arrears of VAT, corporate income tax and personal income tax, which will be sent again to the German tax administration.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has received a new request from the Czech tax administrator for the recovery of tax arrears concerning the same taxpayer who owes CZK 7,079,735 in income tax and VAT.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the Czech tax authority sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of tax arrears of a Czech taxpayer who owed CZK 3 445 782, i.e. EUR 123 328, in personal income tax and VAT.
Of this amount, VAT accounted for CZK 1 133 967.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the German tax administration until 18 April 2007.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech tax administrator the reply of the German tax administration dated 9 July 2007 until 11 November 2008.
The reply stated that the German tax authorities had issued an execution order on 11 June 2007 against a bank account, but that the bank had stated that it had no business relations with the taxpayer.
As a result, the German tax authorities considered the application to be completed.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the Czech tax authority sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of VAT arrears totalling CZK 1 296 845, or EUR 43 591.
The request from the Czech tax administrator was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
On 15 December 2005, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the German tax administration.
Before sending the request for recovery, the Czech tax administrator executed execution on the debtor's funds in bank accounts and withholding from wages and established a mortgage on the immovable property.
The request for recovery was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authorities on 16 March 2005.
The reply to the request for information received by the Czech tax authority on 16 September 2005 showed that the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had an income of EUR 8 437 from non-business activities.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery on 20.4.2006, but forwarded it to the Czech tax authority only on 12.2.2008.
The reply stated that no recovery proceedings could be initiated in Germany because of the debtor's insolvency - no assets had been identified and his non-business income was already subject to another enforcement procedure.
The German tax authorities therefore considered the request for recovery to be completed.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States follow the same European legislation.
Therefore, the way in which requests for international recovery assistance are handled is the same in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The SAO and the SAO compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not match.
In a 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay particular attention to the management of their statistics.
In the 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of statistical discrepancies had decreased, although the number of applications had increased.
Both SAIs consider it important to renegotiate statistical issues at EU level.
This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent discrepancies, otherwise the data reported by individual EU countries in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, both SAIs agree that reliable statistics should show the annual number of claims as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amounts recovered by each Member State.
Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by Member States, as this can assist Member States in assessing their own effectiveness in fighting VAT fraud.
The fact that recovery rates can be calculated on a Member State-by-Member basis is considered useful by both SAIs for Member States with lower recovery rates to step up their efforts and try to improve recovery rates to at least the EU average.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.
In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for recovery on time to the local tax authorities.
A similar situation was found for requests for international assistance received from tax authorities in the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not comply with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on International Assistance for the Recovery of Claims, because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in the recovery within six months from the date of the acknowledgement of receipt of the application.
4.5 Scrutiny of large tax entities
4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic
General information
The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.
The procedural procedure for the control of VDS is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons that were established or established for business purposes and whose net turnover for the tax period stated in the personal/corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 billion or more.
The classification of the taxpayer as a VDS took place after the submission of the income tax return for the relevant tax period, for the first time for 2003.
A taxpayer ceases to be classified as a VDS if, in three consecutive tax years from the end of the period in which he submitted the tax return on the basis of which he was classified as a VDS, his net turnover for the tax year falls below that threshold.
A taxpayer may not be removed from the VDS register without a tax inspection of at least one tax per tax year.
All VDS were checked at a minimum five-year frequency until the end of 2009.
From 2010 onwards, a written assessment of the taxpayer must be carried out at least every 2 years and the subsequent procedure chosen must eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.
The audit of the FC is focused on at least one type of tax; The tax administrator usually chooses several tax periods at once.
The VDS were audited by the specialised inspection departments, which are set up in 13 FUs in total, or by the staff of the inspection departments of the locally competent FUs.
The Specialised Controls Unit shall carry out tax audits within the remit set by the Director of the Financial Directorate.
In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines
• tax entities operating in unusual and specific business lines;
• entities where it is technically and time-consuming to carry out a tax audit;
• entities with a diversified territorial and organisational structure;
• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;
• Entities linked in chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified lure of excess deductions.
The number of tax inspections carried out by the specialised control units of the FC and the results of these inspections are shown in Table 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed an amendment to Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on Territorial Financial Authorities, which consists in the establishment of a specialised Tax Office with nationwide competence for selected tax entities (i.a. for legal entities established for business purposes that have achieved a turnover of more than CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Scrutiny of large tax entities in Germany
General information
VAT controls for large companies are governed by the same rules as tax controls in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: • German Fiscal Code (AO), • Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), • Tax Control Regulations (BpO).
Other methodological documents are also in force.
German Fiscal Code
The statutory provisions on control are laid down in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - Tax Inspection on the Spot. In particular, those articles lay down the rules governing the admissibility of an on-the-spot tax inspection (i.e. at the premises of the undertaking), their scope in terms of subject matter, the rules governing the allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of the inspection notice, the principles of the inspection, the obligation for the taxpayer to cooperate and the prerequisites for carrying out the final consultation and communication of the inspection report.
Tax inspections on the spot are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).
Fiscal Governance Act Under Article 5.1(1) in conjunction with Article 19 of the Law, participation in tax on-the-spot checks by the tax authorities is compulsory for the Federal Central Tax Office.
The participating authorities shall agree on the nature and extent of the involvement of the Federal Central Tax Office in tax inspections on the spot.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that the specific undertakings it collects be inspected within a period to be determined by it.
In such a case, it may publish rules on the conduct and content of the inspection at the premises of those companies.
Rules on fiscal controls Pursuant to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the regulations on tax inspections (German abbreviation BpO 2000) were approved by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house of the German Parliament in which the governments of the Länder are represented).
These administrative rules apply to on-the-spot checks carried out by the Land tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Enterprises are classified by size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of the BPO 2000.
Large undertakings are subject to ex post control (Article 4.2 of the BPO).
Under Article 33.1 of the BpO 2000, any informed tax authority must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in the BpO 2000.
Methodological guidance
In addition to the above, the additional methodology for the tax administration is set out in the following guidelines:
• Uniform manual for special VAT controls in Germany;
• a USLO manual setting out the methodology for the use of data on intra-community business relationships maintained in the VIES system;
• a ZAUBER manual setting out the methodology for the use of the ZAUBER database;
• working aids for various and special items.
The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits depending on the type of business.
Data are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the following three years.
The number of companies to be inspected - not just large companies - must be determined at regular inspection intervals.
As a general rule, inspections of large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.
Controls are usually announced, including VAT controls.
This means that, in the course of the inspection, checks are carried out definitively, in particular on income tax, excise duty and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.
VAT inspections may be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.
Implementation varies and depends on the organisation of the Länder.
The number of tax periods covered by the controls usually varies between three and five years.
The BpO 2000 foresees a control period of three years.
All taxes of the company are subject to verification.
4.5.3 Control management of large tax entities
Both SAIs decided not to examine individual cases of performed VDS checks, but focused on management issues in order to gain an overview of how tax administrations manage the issue of VDS VAT controls.
In the form of a questionnaire, they gathered information from tax authorities on the areas they considered essential for managing this issue.
• What statistical records and analyses concerning the VAT control of VDS are available to the tax administration management?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or records of the extent to which the fight against VAT fraud is distinguished from VAT control in general?
Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow such resolution with the current data version.
Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between a control designed to combat VAT fraud and a general VAT control.
• Are there any statistics or records of the timeliness of VAT controls (linked to the time period of the audited transactions)?
Czech Republic: The records of the timeliness of the questioning with relevance for intra-Community acquisition of goods for selected VAT payers are reported in the ADIS system.
In addition, the information recorded in the ADIS also includes data such as how long the questioning took.
Germany: No, the uniform statistics at Federal level for tax inspectors only contain information on the average time of the last inspection (year information).
This figure does not provide an overview of selected control periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.
VAT inspectors focus on the most recent tax assessment period; They also have the right to carry out VDS checks.
However, the statistics produced at federal level for the special VAT control units do not provide information on the classification of tax entities.
• Are there any statistics or records on the nature of the additional tax revenue generated, disaggregated e.g. according to the following criteria:
i. net increase in tax liability (e.g. in cases where the taxpayer has unduly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);
ii. only nominal increase in tax liability (e.g. transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax period);
iii. additional collection of the tax revenue (payment of the additional tax due).
Czech Republic:
The Czech Tax Administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the volumes of tax additionally assessed broken down by type of tax, by the number of tax entities audited and by the number of tax periods audited.
Other tax procedures (local investigations, complaints procedures) are followed in the same way.
Time data and amounts of additional taxes paid are recorded as a separate task.
Statistics on general debts broken down by type of tax are also kept, but not by declared tax or tax established by the tax authorities.
Germany: No, the uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not distinguish between these criteria.
Moreover, most of the tax administrations visited do not distinguish these differences.
• Are there control areas that generate high additional revenue?
Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to collect tax payers for verification based on criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special sections of the ADIS.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
It follows that uniform statistics at Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide such data.
However, there is one coordinated approach between the finance ministers of the Länder and the federal government.
In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must record the increased tax (VAT) they have imposed if it exceeds a certain amount.
In such a case, it must specify, for example, the nature of the increase in tax liability assessed.
• What are the most common findings?
Czech Republic:
- VDSs claim an undue right to deduct input tax in respect of supplies and services:
• which have not been used to carry out any economic activity pursuant to Section 72(1) of the VAT Act;
• which have been used for representation pursuant to Section 75(3) of the VAT Act;
• on the basis of tax documents which did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73(1) of the VAT Act;
- The VDS did not declare output VAT pursuant to Section 21(1) of the VAT Act.
Germany: It has been noted that there are no regulations at federal level.
It follows that uniform statistics at Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide such data.
Findings concerning VAT are not separately registered by the Länder if they result from the VDS tax inspections.
However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder have to enter the increased tax (VAT) liability they have imposed if it exceeds a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse this information.
• Does the tax administration carry out analyses of the areas of control that generate a high ‘return’ and draw the consequences for management?
Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they are launching nationwide audits focused on risky commodities or the subject of economic activity.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
The uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide data on audit areas that generate high ‘returns’.
There are different views on the process of analysis as well as on the management of cases in terms of materiality.
Some regional tax offices provide special information, but its use is at the discretion of the tax authorities.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
The differences in the replies of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a lot of data from the tax inspections carried out, as well as data from the financial statements - balance sheets and profit and loss statements.
Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to guide the selection of risk-prone cases.
The same applies to the analysis and management of VAT control in general.
In 2012, the establishment of a specialised financial office for the management of VDS is planned in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.
It follows that it is more difficult to carry out those tasks in a similar manner.
However, Germany's philosophy places more emphasis on the selection of individual cases on the basis of the data from the submitted tax returns.
The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.
Expert auditors must be able to assess the exact amount of VAT on the basis of adequate reference notes.
Both SAIs agree that Member States should be able to ensure adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.
This will help to reduce VAT revenue shortfalls.
As a result, the revenue from VAT collection will increase and the risk detection rate for unreliable entrepreneurs will improve.
5. Conclusion
The cooperation of both SAIs on parallel controls of the VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and BRH.
The two SAIs have become better acquainted with each other's systems in the following areas: • intra-community transactions; • VAT risk management, in particular as regards the selection of risk-prone transactions; • VAT recovery assistance; and • VAT control of large tax entities.
Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in VAT fraud detection strategies as well as differences in the above mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany have been revealed.
The audit findings were compared and used to identify best practices.
In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to launch a debate on approaches and strategies within Member States, including at European Commission level.
The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation between the two SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT administration.
6. Communiqué
The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the President of the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof) of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Closing date: June 2010.
